00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.960
 those who almost always play here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.049
 shooting sponge 'not up to like 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.870
 I did not die so he would not kill me 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 kill in a false and good move 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.020
 it's really the first to tell you that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.150
 good is trying to raise the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.550
 gameplays as good I said by the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.320
 comments the examples walt fruit and not

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 good yesterday before yesterday I do not know very 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.810
 ok why so I'll start to start the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 gameplay 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.739
 alan wake will not start this Friday 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 I think tomorrow not tomorrow on a Friday 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 Well, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, Thursday, 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
 last Friday I will try to try that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 I leave youtube and I will try to upload it already 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.870
 to start the series and start the 2.0 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.489
 of alan white not and good to give shows e 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 I'll try to upload it tomorrow then that's 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.400
 Thursday and aver if youtube behaves and I 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.800
 let's upload them, as you can see, good to say 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.480
 that I will continue to try now 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 some in basic to attract the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 tomorrow also here is the drone of 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.539
 recognition that one finds out about nothing 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.190
 I said it well to get in some wet 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.759
 in basic to go up in the morning that does not 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.500
 as I say I am in prison of one if 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.950
 you remember that I told you that I had many 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.750
 jobs by going up the end because almost 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 they are all up there are failing the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.440
 bullets scarce posts at the beginning not at 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.929
 I start a post then to post to 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.750
 not to not die not and well really 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.880
 Well, what I 'm going to try to do tomorrow 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 be more basic than I think he's already playing 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 gets tired of a drop shock of those of the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
 few that you are going to see in the channel of the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.590
 few that you have seen because I am not very 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.329
 given to make them really went with the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.970
 configuration 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.100
 nothing of practice and good costs to make them 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 really with practice it's easier 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.549
 but good that end in extreme I 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.390
 I think it really influences the 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.490
 point and start shooting 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.729
 before the enemy does not like in basic 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.430
 which bonus plus other things do not and good 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.380
 as always domain is a game mode 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.750
 that really is the one I like most about 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.209
 all call of duty and good really 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 you like this morning or this afternoon or 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.930
 it has gone up a bit of black ops I do not know 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.900
 if you want me to continue uploading black ops and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.560
 from time to time or you prefer very warfare 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.959
 3 well really the idea would be to upload a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.700
 little of all is to go up black ops and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.650
 upload modern warfare 3 like today but not 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.660
 I know if you feel like it if you prefer 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800
 2 let modern warfare 3 begin 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.330
 you prefer one of modern warfare 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.700
 select from black ops I do not know what I 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.840
 you say no to me it really gives me 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 Like I play both things 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.300
 lately I play black ops no 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.650
 quite not too much but yes that game 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.840
 then I do not care about something that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.459
 others the truth I prefer that I 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.940
 tell me you tell me you prefer that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.040
 upload and what do you prefer to upload 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.019
 play everything but as you really are 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
 you who see the videos 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.090
 that you like that what you see that you 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 move what you see not 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.310
 and good commenting on pp 90 with 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.629
 large chargers and fast fires here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.400
 trying to kill those who take to is 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.410
 a very good way if you carry a weapon 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.060
 long if you carry this submachine gun or 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.890
 any other is quite complicated 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.250
 with the mp 7 it can be done from there 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.200
 you can kill the objects man alfano 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.690
 and good what we give that has the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.470
 although they have other maps I think the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.110
 there is one is a map that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 I like it because everything is very 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 centralized is type 2 but with heights 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
 and buildings and other stories for 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.990
 camperos for one campers I do not know is a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 map that is very very well I like 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.830
 how is it structured let's say the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 building remembers many things 4 under my 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.070
 point of view some maps and that's why I 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.630
 I think people like me 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.020
 I think I like it 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.190
 in my opinion I do not know I do not know why 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.530
 you will think is one of the maps that more 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.810
 mola he likes people is not 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.310
 and to your case if it is your case 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.930
 can you tell me why a mola because no 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.360
 cool I do not know how to explain it very well to me 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.880
 I like it because I think that yes and 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.320
 is already not really do not have one another 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.790
 explanation and good as you see dominating 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.220
 dominating the area of ​​your restaurant that 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.870
 have them see if they have 20 you can 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.540
 control pretty pretty pretty well 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.370
 you do not see here and are reborn in this area of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 here it is going towards what is coming 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.480
 to what it really is for them 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.390
 get locked in the backup and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.160
 who have got the two letters but 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.989
 If you do it right and you get to kill you 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.090
 you come train like in this case 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.970
 so 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.500
 if you do not have two letters what you have 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.470
 what to do in between the middle of the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.630
 two that have them worth is the most 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.150
 simple to get the lava and you see 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.680
 the mohamed calmly took her out 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.410
 simple to get it and good the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 departure really lasts little because you know 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.199
 look low you are going to see it hangs my 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.690
 departure is as always not as as 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.750
 almost always that good people 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.930
 Tired or scratched and you prefer not to see here 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.389
 camping doing a little more really 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.550
 people do not understand that here aspires 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.800
 Sailing in every corner in each 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.380
 map area but good in what there is 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.050
 is what we have done with this mode 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.530
 warfare 3 I think a white and less 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.940
 campers that before but more I do not know how 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.740
 I say what has touched me if we like it 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
 well and if not then bad luck we 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.610
 we change of game not really in 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.260
 whites 2 I do not know how it will be but 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.350
 surely it is the same that here is not 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.570
 As in this stress because 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.010
 really people do not change and as you see 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 one comes to Iran and I almost always 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.240
 they have a good charge 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.909
 I say you have to throw your hand because the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.009
 I have to look at last battle all 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.770
 there is richly and you are not going to see what 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:42.080
 what's up we go here quietly see 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.610
 cobra let's charge this one, not what 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.449
 we charge but charges here quietly 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.030
 another that bites the dust and good 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.770
 it's really amazing that people are 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.720
 pull a game I do not say that 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.370
 do not really go when, for example, 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.900
 the game is already about to end and 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.629
 give you the same not really for example 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.800
 is going to 198 losing to 150 then you can 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.990
 go to save a little time in 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.490
 how long does the migration of 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.229
 games or what it takes at home the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.539
 game of more there is shot to love and 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.069
 attention because the game is going away 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:11.180
 is going to cut shortly so I do not expect anything 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.699
 that you liked it I hope that I have 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.150
 molado the gameplay nothing we see in the 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.150
 next
