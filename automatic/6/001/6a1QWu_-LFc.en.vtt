the<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.480> yet<00:00:27.689> I've<00:00:28.470> only<00:00:29.000> just<00:00:30.109> connected<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the way yet I've only just connected the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.260 
the way yet I've only just connected the
connector<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.730> LCD<00:00:33.239> i

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
kind of test the digitizer he do not

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.290 
kind of test the digitizer he do not
have<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.890> push<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> way<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
have to push this all the way down to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.440 
have to push this all the way down to
test<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.740> keep<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.490> out<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.300> don't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
test it just to keep it out so you don't

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.760 
test it just to keep it out so you don't
waste<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.930> bunch<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.140> time<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> said

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
waste a bunch of time like I said

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.680 
waste a bunch of time like I said
earlier<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.190> then<00:02:30.430> just<00:02:30.700> kind<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.210> test<00:02:31.510> it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
earlier and then just kind of test it

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.080 
earlier and then just kind of test it
make<00:02:31.840> sure<00:02:31.900> everything<00:02:32.470> works<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.760> anything

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
make sure everything works but anything

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.670 
make sure everything works but anything
works<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:34.600> fine<00:02:34.780> if<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.050> simply<00:02:35.350> push

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
works just fine if you just simply push

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.380 
works just fine if you just simply push
it<00:02:35.830> down<00:02:35.920> or<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.220> cellular<00:02:40.090> devices

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
it down or but I'm on cellular devices

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.300 
it down or but I'm on cellular devices
or<00:02:40.900> other<00:02:41.080> media<00:02:41.320> devices<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.070> maybe<00:02:42.220> a

or other media devices and maybe a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.780 
or other media devices and maybe a
little<00:02:42.460> bit<00:02:42.640> easier<00:02:43.320> disassemble<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.790> this

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
little bit easier disassemble it this

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.880 
little bit easier disassemble it this
one<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> take<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.260> an<00:02:47.410> exacto

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
one you just have to take like an exacto

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.530 
one you just have to take like an exacto
knife<00:02:48.100> or<00:02:48.370> something<00:02:48.610> really<00:02:48.940> flat<00:02:49.300> and

knife or something really flat and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.940 
knife or something really flat and
that's<00:02:49.990> kind<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.350> pry<00:02:50.590> out<00:02:50.620> little<00:02:52.950> these

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
that's kind of pry out little these

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.580 
that's kind of pry out little these
little<00:02:53.980> guys<00:02:54.280> right<00:02:54.430> here<00:02:54.580> clips<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:56.260> anyway

to fold the old ones back and you can
probably<00:03:55.810> even<00:03:55.960> kept<00:03:56.230> those<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.590> doesn't<00:03:56.860> even

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
probably even kept those it doesn't even

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
probably even kept those it doesn't even
matter<00:03:57.160> because<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:58.020> if<00:03:59.610> your<00:04:00.610> front

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
matter because that if your front

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.520 
matter because that if your front
assembly<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.360> cracked<00:04:01.720> you're<00:04:02.050> replacing<00:04:02.410> it

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
assembly is cracked you're replacing it

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.020 
assembly is cracked you're replacing it
anyway<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.070> can<00:04:03.160> just<00:04:03.250> go<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:03.580> cut<00:04:03.820> those

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
anyway so you can just go and cut those

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.590 
anyway so you can just go and cut those
get<00:04:04.360> those<00:04:04.540> out<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.870> way<00:04:04.950> but<00:04:05.950> um<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:07.390> it's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
get those out of the way but um if it's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.210 
get those out of the way but um if it's
if<00:04:07.959> you're<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.350> doing<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.650> color<00:04:08.860> conversion

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
if you're just doing a color conversion

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.030 
if you're just doing a color conversion
just<00:04:09.700> going<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:09.940> be<00:04:10.510> careful<00:04:10.930> when<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.170> pull

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
just going to be careful when you pull

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.730 
just going to be careful when you pull
them<00:04:12.190> back<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.820> don't<00:04:12.880> I'll<00:04:13.840> tear<00:04:14.320> them<00:04:14.530> or

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
them back so you don't I'll tear them or

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.550 
them back so you don't I'll tear them or
break<00:04:15.070> them<00:04:15.130> then<00:04:15.970> put<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.420> cables<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.470> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
break them then put the cables to the
