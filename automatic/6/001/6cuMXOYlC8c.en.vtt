notice<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.660> thickness<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.470> stock<00:00:36.510> all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
notice the thickness on the stock all

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.270 
notice the thickness on the stock all
the<00:00:37.750> fine<00:00:37.989> root<00:00:38.290> hairs<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.830> are<00:00:38.890> growing<00:00:39.190> on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280

this<00:00:39.489> route<00:00:41.130> elongated<00:00:42.130> Manor<00:00:56.580> it's<00:00:58.470> gonna

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
this route elongated Manor it's gonna

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:23.230 
this route elongated Manor it's gonna
walk<00:00:59.680> across

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.980 

so<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.510> looking<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.050> every<00:01:25.110> difference

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
so we're looking at for every difference

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
so we're looking at for every difference
one<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.230> long<00:01:28.530> route<00:01:28.800> but<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.220> too<00:01:29.400> fine

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
one nice long route but not too fine

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.280 
one nice long route but not too fine
roots<00:01:30.440> not<00:01:31.440> seeing<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.780> bigger<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:33.990> pod

roots not seeing the bigger in the pod

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.270 
roots not seeing the bigger in the pod
count<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:36.030> running<00:01:36.300> about<00:01:36.510> 60<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> 70<00:01:38.010> across

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
microbes and in the 30s on these plants

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.950 
microbes and in the 30s on these plants
they'll<00:01:44.070> pull<00:01:44.280> couple<00:01:44.580> more<00:01:53.630> cut<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> main

they'll pull couple more cut the main
long<00:01:55.860> route<00:01:56.160> still<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.190> pods<00:01:59.430> don't

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
long route still and then the pods don't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.320 
long route still and then the pods don't

enhanced<00:02:09.869> notice<00:02:10.740> how<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> pods<00:02:11.190> are

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
enhanced notice how the pods are

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.210 
enhanced notice how the pods are
starting<00:02:11.820> same<00:02:12.780> height<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.440> deposit<00:02:14.160> down

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
starting same height but deposit down

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.470 
starting same height but deposit down
here<00:02:14.490> starting<00:02:14.850> right<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.300> they're<00:02:15.390> not
