00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 we have come with easy money depot 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.000
 after the most interesting anime of these 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.920
 whole summer season in sunday rose god 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 as the English is the saying goes 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.440
 because God has left the world 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 that is, no one can on its own 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
 ask questions and bauble soul peace to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.720
 can really die in such a way now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.470
 called grave guardians have courage is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.470
 a daughter came judge but village 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:40.890
 one day he will be fine and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 clarify also from that day on had 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 the dream to save the world and me 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.649
 just have to say I think this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.230
 basic aspect ever so cool 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.840
 the story itself is really great then 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 we just got it right from mad house 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.660
 nice animations this whole world in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 It is very interesting 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.840
 from the characters, they rank 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.969
 actually all pretty 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 I have to do it interesting 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.840
 admit that they are from some others 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.299
 characters such as the princess with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 dead or more screentime desired 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.150
 but it would be okay 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.400
 just as was a few scratches on the belly 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.110
 asked why they have to be there 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 such as the fight not quite 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 clear 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.189
 or like me in the god yes 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.259
 academics were hikers too 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.790
 other characters really more 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.860
 Screentime would have let that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.369
 would really recommend in you now 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.990
 Cologne 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 but all in all , I can do this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 four main arx pretty well done 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.560
 I liked this city best 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390
 the dead and the last act me too 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.580
 but still 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.530
 Two doors must be the whole reason 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 this subject's theme 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 interested or area and will 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.700
 actually told relatively serious 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.920
 the parking spaces have funnier moments 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.920
 but i am the first reason and stay 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.930
 the good generally the place of action as 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.930
 I was also pretty interesting 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.789
 This was the most interesting to the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.720
 society 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.420
 Academy of the one actually relative 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.640
 learns little and this sham world the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.530
 The music was also extremely interesting 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.080
 Anime is really amazing 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.640
 both boeing and a thing so the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.310
 I can only recommend you to teams today 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.590
 in all cases a conclusion I think 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.450
 personally that it is not so over the arm 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.060
 there are many bad things to say 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.819
 just simply a two things simple 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.349
 some unnecessary characters doing this and 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.620
 in between I thought so already 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.060
 well, so the gold card for example 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.280
 should not necessarily have been but 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 okay otherwise we have as I said one 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.900
 extremely interesting topic the story 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.180
 is well enforced we have to 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.940
 a nice character animations 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.709
 unbelievably good the world is general 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 very atmospheric, as I said 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.579
 the world of the dead city of the dead and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.209
 the sparkle world 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.799
 but the best was the feeling of this 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.700
 strange godless world is really 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.290
 good way a bit of the example 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 is also back in the west running in the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.150
 still presents cinema meets that is the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.010
 really over and given right 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.750
 cool but okay that of course always 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.390
 I can decide here firmly 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.210
 you issue a clear recommendation 0 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.890
 and until 89 of boot and as always will 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.650
 of course, all said his opinion 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.280
 I do not want to do it alone 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.280
 a citigroup
