progressed a great deal in the last
twenty<00:00:10.260> years<00:00:10.289> or<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.709> there's<00:00:11.549> been<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:12.449> real

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
twenty years or so there's been a real

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.670 
twenty years or so there's been a real
evolution<00:00:14.000> in<00:00:15.000> materials<00:00:15.600> engineered<00:00:16.529> wood

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
evolution in materials engineered wood

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.029 
evolution in materials engineered wood
products<00:00:17.150> in<00:00:18.150> manufacturing<00:00:18.839> and<00:00:19.170> also<00:00:19.769> in

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
products in manufacturing and also in

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.490 
products in manufacturing and also in
connection<00:00:20.310> engineering<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.060> wood<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
connection engineering in wood so you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
connection engineering in wood so you
see<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.220> five<00:00:23.820> axis<00:00:24.269> CNC<00:00:24.720> machine<00:00:25.939> which

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
see here a five axis CNC machine which

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.079 
see here a five axis CNC machine which
is<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.269> common<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> few<00:00:28.589> locations<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
is now common in a few locations in in

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.510 
is now common in a few locations in in
North<00:00:30.300> America<00:00:30.749> and<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.800> many<00:00:31.980> places<00:00:32.250> in

North America and in many places in
Europe<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.970> these<00:00:33.840> machines<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:34.860> can

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
Europe and these machines which can

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.830 
Europe and these machines which can
rotate<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.910> five<00:00:36.120> axes<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.750> they

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
rotate about around five axes so they

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020 
rotate about around five axes so they
can<00:00:36.989> literally<00:00:37.410> carve<00:00:37.710> wood<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> about

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
Norway that has studied the 17-story

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.599 
Norway that has studied the 17-story
building<00:03:29.709> which<00:03:30.129> is<00:03:30.310> as<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:31.269> now<00:03:31.389> unrealized

with<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.639> concrete<00:03:34.060> core<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.299> believe<00:03:34.689> there's<00:03:35.379> a

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
with a concrete core I believe there's a

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.469 
with a concrete core I believe there's a
20<00:03:37.629> possibly<00:03:38.439> 30-story<00:03:39.040> building<00:03:39.479> being

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
20 possibly 30-story building being

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.330 
20 possibly 30-story building being
studied<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:40.930> Austria<00:03:41.349> which<00:03:41.709> uses<00:03:42.069> wood

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
studied in Austria which uses wood

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.849 
studied in Austria which uses wood
concrete<00:03:42.519> composite<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.439> again<00:03:44.439> a<00:03:44.470> concrete

concrete composite and again a concrete

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.349 
concrete composite and again a concrete
core<00:03:45.299> but<00:03:46.409> I<00:03:47.409> think<00:03:47.979> our<00:03:48.189> study<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.759> unique<00:03:49.209> in

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
core but I think our study is unique in

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.509 
core but I think our study is unique in
the<00:03:49.449> fact<00:03:49.479> that<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.229> it's<00:03:50.949> been<00:03:51.189> carried

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
the fact that it is it's been carried

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.580 
the fact that it is it's been carried
out<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.849> high<00:03:51.970> seismic<00:03:52.239> zone<00:03:52.569> with<00:03:53.259> an<00:03:53.439> all

solid wood core

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.319 
solid wood core
we<00:03:55.989> believe<00:03:56.259> that<00:03:56.549> tall<00:03:57.549> wood<00:03:57.849> construction

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
we believe that tall wood construction

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.259 
we believe that tall wood construction
is<00:03:58.870> something<00:03:59.259> that<00:03:59.409> will<00:03:59.620> become<00:03:59.949> real<00:04:00.269> we

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
is something that will become real we

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.550 
is something that will become real we
don't<00:04:01.449> know<00:04:01.540> how<00:04:01.689> soon<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.109> course<00:04:02.290> there's<00:04:02.500> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
don't know how soon of course there's a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.309 
don't know how soon of course there's a
lot<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.769> testing<00:04:03.129> to<00:04:03.159> be<00:04:03.280> done<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:05.019> is

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
lot of testing to be done but this is

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.159 
lot of testing to be done but this is
what<00:04:05.829> high-rise<00:04:06.310> living<00:04:07.120> could<00:04:07.750> look<00:04:07.930> like

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
what high-rise living could look like
