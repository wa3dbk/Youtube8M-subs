 usually place a human being before two 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.269
 alternatives the easiest thing is to surrender 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.789
 accept a fate a destiny to throw 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.500

 they prefer to take second life the only thing 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.229
 I wanted to go home to be in 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.659

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.180
 Y 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.880

 spears and we have read your amazing 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.040
 story that the book has already expired in 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.939
 bbc neus a story dating from mid 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.369
 of the sixties when speed pitcher of 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.799
 Australian javelin was in 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.289
 london trying to recover from a 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.470
 injury to participate in the games 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.130
 Olympics of Tokyo in 1964 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.690
 a few months away from the big sports event 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.110
 seeing that his recovery was not going 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 as planned 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.500
 he had no choice but to assume that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.750
 could not compete in Japanese lands 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.840
 for that reason he accepted a job in a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 London airport in order to gather the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.370
 amount needed to return to your 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.370
 home in adelaide 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.090
 he had almost treasured the precise sum 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.550
 when he found himself face to face with 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.890
 the misfortune someone stole all his 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.770
 savings leaving you in a worse situation 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.180
 that when he had come to the united kingdom- 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.130
 knowing that his wife was waiting 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.430
 and with her daughter's birthday that she 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.310
 they were approaching spears refused to start from 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.410
 zero again if I did it would never come 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.959
 in time to see your little one blow 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.540
 the candles working in the terminal 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.510
 aerial saw how they were sent daily 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.090
 animals from corner to another of the planet of 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.550
 so he thought if they can because not 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.310
 I was going to be able to do it myself 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.720
 the athlete asked for help from a partner and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.720
 designed a wooden box of 15 x 09 x 0 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.140
 75 meters as can be seen in the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.990
 image 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.570
 in that space you could lie on your 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.600
 back bending the knees or 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.790
 sit with your legs stretched 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.340
 besides opening from inside in case of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.740
 emergency with a food packet 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.480
 one bottle of water and another empty one for 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.090
 urinate inside 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 spears was introduced in its container and 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.530
 he sent himself by mail against 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.840
 refund to perth a small airport 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.870
 and with few security measures the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.630
 time the first problem was raised 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.700
 before starting the trip because the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.570
 fog caused a delay of nothing less 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.570
 that one day on your flight 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.379
 when the crossing began, a 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.829
 moment of your box to stretch your legs 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.599
 and urinated in a can when he heard that 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.269
 someone was coming back 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.959
 hastily forgetting his hiding place 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.180
 his improvised urinal on the outside 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.849
 was fortunate that the operators of the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.639
 paris airport first stop in your 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.090
 odyssey believed that it was a 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.090
 joke of his British colleagues 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.789
 suffered much more on the scale in bombay 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.940
 when he spent several hours exposed to a 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.740
 just relentless that was the reason that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.650
 Take off your clothes without leaving the box 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.950
 and complete the rest of the nude 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.530
 journey 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.810
 the face of the authorities would have been 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.410
 a poem if they had discovered it in 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.410
 that moment 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.400
 after three days of madness he knew that 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.560
 had reached its destination when 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.630
 he heard the particular accent of 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.570
 workers protesting the 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.270
 size and weight of their habitat that came out 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.150
 from him in the warehouse and he managed 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.860
 to flee from perth airport and 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.870
 move by road to Adelaide 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.490
 his only mistake was forgetting to communicate 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.530
 with his buddy in london for 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.830
 let them know that he had succeeded 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.490
 this worried friend gave notice to the 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.910
 press and spears away from being reprimanded 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.750
 he became a media star 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.090
 praised as a true fighter 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.050
 Australian until then his own 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.390
 wife 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.540
 I thought I was joking when I heard her 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.080
 adventure is what has got what 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.080
 impossible 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.260
 and here we end with this incredible 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.630
 history 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.850
