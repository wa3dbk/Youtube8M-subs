00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.340
 manicure design will create on 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.320
 trademark keys 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 This product is here provided to me 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.169
 on a review by amaryllis juice and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 I will leave in the infobox under the video I already 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.690
 prepared the marigold leveled the formula and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.390
 made a manicure on our base coverage 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 Broadway means has no sharp smell 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.740
 it even seemed to me that the kitchen was green 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.550
 an apple but it is rather the smell of aloe 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.370
 which extract is part of as 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 butter product she really liked 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 dries quickly protects well against saint 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.940
 the locale is really as if slightly 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.280
 moisturizes the nail plate like 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.380
 promises manufacturer 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.229
 the tool is an accelerator of growth while 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.360
 I did not notice this effect because 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 I use it not so long ago but I will 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.310
 watch for on topic in vial base 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.759
 green but after drying on 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.630
 nails 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.499
 it becomes transparent now I put 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.139
 white lacquer from keys hd 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:24.030
 he is called the snow berry this varnish 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:25.920
 really snow white pretty 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 thick applied in two layers 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 flat brush wide but not round 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.100
 smooth and cut very comfortable application 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 lacquer behaves obediently 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.299
 as if it is spreading itself on the nail 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.299
 plate 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.749
 when the varnish is completely dry stuck in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.850
 quality stencil strip for this 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.819
 I use tape for nail design on 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.039
 sticky base can be replaced with ordinary 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.270
 scotch cut it into even strips 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.270
 required width 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.640
 when all the strips are glued and fully 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.600
 invited I advise this to give special 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.490
 focus on our one layer of black lacquer 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.460
 I use black elbows site 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.740
 black currant thanks to its strong 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.930
 only one layer of pigmentation 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.630
 to achieve a tight shade without 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.850
 baldness brush is as comfortable as 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 his white lacquer suspecting that she 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.890
 the same for the whole collection and honor 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.670
 just a few seconds after 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.440
 applying black lacquer 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.440
 carefully removing the strips 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.100
 now claiming complete drying 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.960
 good black currant does it fast 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.850
 to complement the design i use 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.850
 keys from keys precious metal 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 judging by the course on the Internet it seemed to me 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.500
 that they are plastic but in 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.410
 it's actually metal 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.820
 rivets are different from ordinary ones in that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.459
 has a sticky base 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.410
 and most importantly after removal does not lose its 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.410
 light unlike ordinary 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.380
 now not for durability and durability 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.260
 your manicure 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.230
 I apply a layer of topcoat using 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.150
 gel confinement manicure from keys confess 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.000
 pretty skeptical 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.350
 stated title but he justified it 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.480
 completely this current is not only for long 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.050
 protects the paint from chipping or 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.490
 cracks 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.860
 but also give mega splash a manicure if 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 it still had a drying effect and made up 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.000
 serious competition for my favorite of 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.530
 current 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.110
 gel retainer does not tighten and not 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.820
 dissolves varnish therefore after application 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.650
 pigs need to be cleaned from colored pigment 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.260
 To diversify the design I decided 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.050
 use a set of current 3 and into it 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.030
 includes three top 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.930
 glossy shimmering with a fine shimmer 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.930
 get out 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.830
 design wanted to add matte 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.789
 the effect of regret after applying this 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.909
 top analog 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.159
 no frosted effect it is rather rubber 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.789
 Something in between glossy and matt 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.759
 finish though in this design looks 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.759
 quite interesting this top is not for me 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.889
 came up in just a couple of hours the tips 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.460
 nails rubbed become shiny 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.620
 and the next day they become glossy 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:55.669
 all cover why are you 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:58.520
 but this top is not for me here 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.560
 result had me design this 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.090
 the design lasted more than four 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.590
 days 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.840
 the scene of the production keys to me is very 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.560
 I liked it so I will be happy 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.389
 use it future if you design 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.949
