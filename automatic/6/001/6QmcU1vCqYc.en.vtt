00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
bad for an attacking mid 76 dribbling 82

very very good stats he's very tall

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
very very good stats he's very tall
would<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.570> very<00:02:15.810> slow<00:02:15.960> player<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.500> personally

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
would be very slow player I personally

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.830 
would be very slow player I personally
would<00:02:17.190> actually<00:02:17.490> move<00:02:17.640> him<00:02:17.910> down<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
would actually move him down to a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.660 
would actually move him down to a
sentiment<00:02:19.350> or<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> defensive<00:02:20.190> mid<00:02:20.370> because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
sentiment or a defensive mid because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
sentiment or a defensive mid because
we've<00:02:20.820> stats<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.240> those<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.160> passing<00:02:23.160> like

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
we've stats like those and passing like

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.680 
we've stats like those and passing like
that<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.880> something<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.300> will<00:02:24.570> be

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that that is something that will be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.020 
that that is something that will be
absolutely<00:02:25.290> brilliant<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.610> second

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
absolutely brilliant so the second

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.140 
absolutely brilliant so the second
player<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.070> central<00:02:29.070> midfield<00:02:29.520> area<00:02:29.970> is

pace in your attacking mid you have got

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.830 
pace in your attacking mid you have got
no<00:02:39.750> chance<00:02:40.020> that's<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.740> moral<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> story

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
no chance that's the moral of the story

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200 
no chance that's the moral of the story
over<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:42.990> we<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.190> Rodriguez<00:02:44.190> out<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.490> Port

oh<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.630> believe<00:02:46.200> he<00:02:46.320> has<00:02:46.410> moved<00:02:46.530> from<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.830> right

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
oh I believe he has moved from a right

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.700 
oh I believe he has moved from a right
mid<00:02:47.340> or<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.610> right<00:02:47.850> wing<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.720> attack<00:02:49.050> at<00:02:49.200> central

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
mid or a right wing to attack at central

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.290 
mid or a right wing to attack at central
attacking<00:02:49.890> mid<00:02:50.130> which<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.400> very<00:02:50.610> good<00:02:50.820> there's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
attacking mid which is very good there's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.760 
attacking mid which is very good there's
some<00:02:51.450> very<00:02:51.630> nice<00:02:51.870> stats<00:02:52.170> there<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.410> do<00:02:52.530> also

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
some very nice stats there I do also

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.290 
some very nice stats there I do also
believe<00:02:53.040> he's<00:02:53.190> forced<00:02:53.550> our<00:02:53.670> skills<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
believe he's forced our skills so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000 
believe he's forced our skills so
there's<00:02:55.170> already<00:02:55.320> some<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:55.830> fantastic

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
there's already some really fantastic

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
there's already some really fantastic
quarter<00:02:56.580> players<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
quarter players and I really like the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.560 
quarter players and I really like the
look<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.370> perhaps<00:02:59.370> building<00:02:59.820> more<00:03:00.210> Colombian

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
look of perhaps building more Colombian

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.960 
look of perhaps building more Colombian
stuff<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.800> Colombia<00:03:02.280> look<00:03:02.430> great<00:03:02.730> this

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
stuff because Colombia look great this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270 
stuff because Colombia look great this
year<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> center<00:03:04.650> forward<00:03:04.890> position

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
year so in the center forward position

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.520 
year so in the center forward position
as<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> strike<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.120> jabour<00:03:06.780> there's<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.410> really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
as a strike is jabour there's not really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.020

a lot to serve I'm he doesn't look very

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.020 
a lot to serve I'm he doesn't look very
good<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.050> that's<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:11.030> strike

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
good and that that's that really strike

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.300
