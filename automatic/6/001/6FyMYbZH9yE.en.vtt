00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.320 

I<00:00:08.440> think<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:09.559> first<00:00:10.309> thing<00:00:10.549> that<00:00:10.670> happens<00:00:11.210> is

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
I think the first thing that happens is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.830 
I think the first thing that happens is
this<00:00:11.450> sensation<00:00:12.230> of<00:00:12.379> is<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:13.039> safe<00:00:13.370> or<00:00:13.639> not

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
this sensation of is this safe or not

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.200 
this sensation of is this safe or not
that's<00:00:14.840> like<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.230> first<00:00:15.500> instinct<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:16.699> if

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
that's like the first instinct and if

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.689 
that's like the first instinct and if
and<00:00:17.480> then<00:00:17.630> if<00:00:17.810> it<00:00:17.930> feels<00:00:18.230> safe<00:00:18.710> then<00:00:19.130> it's<00:00:19.340> kind

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
and then if it feels safe then it's kind

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.620 
and then if it feels safe then it's kind
of<00:00:19.850> like<00:00:20.350> relaxing<00:00:21.350> a<00:00:21.470> little<00:00:21.500> bit<00:00:21.890> more<00:00:22.630> going

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
of like relaxing a little bit more going

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.620 
of like relaxing a little bit more going
for<00:00:23.870> the<00:00:23.960> ride<00:00:24.200> seeing<00:00:25.180> where<00:00:26.180> they're<00:00:26.360> taking

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
for the ride seeing where they're taking

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.810 
for the ride seeing where they're taking
you<00:00:26.960> feeling<00:00:27.410> how<00:00:27.530> gravity's<00:00:28.070> how<00:00:28.550> your

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
you feeling how gravity's how your

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.189 
you feeling how gravity's how your
grounding<00:00:29.480> even<00:00:29.750> though<00:00:29.840> you're<00:00:30.020> flying

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
grounding even though you're flying

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.990 
grounding even though you're flying
you're<00:00:30.680> still<00:00:30.920> grounding<00:00:31.490> through<00:00:31.760> that

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
you're still grounding through that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.389 
you're still grounding through that
person<00:00:32.539> feeling<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.620> momentum<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.309> the

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
person feeling the momentum and the

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.880 
person feeling the momentum and the
velocity<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.660> sensing<00:00:36.559> where<00:00:36.710> it's

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
velocity and and sensing where it's

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.889 
velocity and and sensing where it's
taking<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:37.520> how<00:00:37.699> long<00:00:38.000> you're<00:00:38.359> up<00:00:38.510> there<00:00:38.780> if

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
taking you how long you're up there if

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.220 
taking you how long you're up there if
you<00:00:39.050> can<00:00:39.079> go<00:00:39.379> higher<00:00:39.620> faster<00:00:40.190> or<00:00:40.520> slower<00:00:41.230> if

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
you can go higher faster or slower if

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.710 
you can go higher faster or slower if
you<00:00:42.590> can<00:00:42.770> invert<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.399> just<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.090> think<00:00:44.510> it's

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
you can invert it just I think it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.240 
you can invert it just I think it's
sensing<00:00:46.390> sensation<00:00:47.390> of<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:48.079> how<00:00:48.500> far<00:00:48.860> can<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
sensing sensation of of how far can you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:03:03.350 
sensing sensation of of how far can you
go<00:00:50.410> with<00:00:51.410> it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.140 

you<00:03:04.360> discover<00:03:05.400> who<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.430> person<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you discover who that person is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.430 
you discover who that person is
physically<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.489> from<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.090> point<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
physically and from that point on you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:04:14.750 
physically and from that point on you
know<00:03:11.680> what<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.819> do<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.590> moment

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.630 

for<00:04:15.760> me<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.060> passion<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.200> whole<00:04:18.130> draw<00:04:18.580> to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
for me the passion and the whole draw to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.050 
for me the passion and the whole draw to
contact<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.630> finding<00:04:20.370> those<00:04:21.370> moments<00:04:21.730> where

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
contact is finding those moments where

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.330 
contact is finding those moments where
you<00:04:22.240> don't<00:04:22.450> know<00:04:22.720> what<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.650> going<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.890> happen

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you don't know what is going to happen

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.570 
you don't know what is going to happen
when<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.730> do<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:26.680> don't<00:04:26.950> know<00:04:27.220> what

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
when you do that you don't know what

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.210 
when you do that you don't know what
will<00:04:27.790> happen<00:04:27.970> if<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.570> pour<00:04:29.080> my<00:04:29.110> way<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:29.890> that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
will happen if I pour my way on that

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.270 
will happen if I pour my way on that
spot<00:04:30.640> at<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.240> speed<00:04:31.690> right<00:04:31.990> now<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.920> there's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
spot at the speed right now and there's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:42.800 
spot at the speed right now and there's
only<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:33.670> way<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.910> find<00:04:34.210> out<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.770> it

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.300 

either<00:04:43.810> think<00:04:44.140> be<00:04:44.350> just<00:04:44.560> as<00:04:44.740> satisfying

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
either think be just as satisfying

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.430 
either think be just as satisfying
whether<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.880> works<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.390> this<00:04:46.540> amazing<00:04:46.810> balance
