alright so now we're going to be taking
a<00:00:02.730> look<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:03.090> writing<00:00:03.870> scripts<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:05.310> remove<00:00:06.000> keys

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
a look at writing scripts to remove keys

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.620 
a look at writing scripts to remove keys
now<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.980> are<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.519> log<00:00:08.849> reader<00:00:09.210> it's

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
now if you are a log reader it's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.230 
now if you are a log reader it's
important<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.440> know<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.920> create<00:00:11.580> registry

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
important to know how to create registry

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.390 
important to know how to create registry
scripts<00:00:12.599> because<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.799> will<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.639> not

computer looked like or well you can be
there<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.129> handle<00:01:02.550> registry<00:01:03.210> editor

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there to actually handle registry editor

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.640 
there to actually handle registry editor
you<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> try<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> tell<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.559> what

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you don't want to try to tell them what

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
you don't want to try to tell them what
to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.360> open<00:01:06.600> notepad<00:01:08.900> copy

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to do you have them open notepad copy

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.990 
to do you have them open notepad copy
and<00:01:10.140> paste<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.740> following<00:01:10.920> textin<00:01:11.790> I'm

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
actually going to write it out for you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.450 
actually going to write it out for you
so<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> specify<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.890> registry

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so you have to specify the registry

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.109 
so you have to specify the registry
editor<00:01:17.939> version<00:01:19.340> technically<00:01:20.340> registry

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
editor version technically registry

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.690 
editor version technically registry
editor<00:01:21.509> version<00:01:21.840> 5<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.500> work<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.490> what

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
editor version 5 will work but what

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.399 
editor version 5 will work but what
we're<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:25.320> regedit<00:01:26.100> for

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
we're going to do is use regedit for

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
we're going to do is use regedit for
because<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> works<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.270> need<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
because it works and you don't need to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780 
because it works and you don't need to
type<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.170> much<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.250> we're<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
type as much in and we're going to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.480 
type as much in and we're going to
delete<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> key<00:01:33.799> deleting<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> value<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
delete the key deleting a value and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.539 
delete the key deleting a value and
changing<00:01:36.090> values<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.630> slightly<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:37.549> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
changing values is slightly different so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
changing values is slightly different so
you<00:01:39.240> need<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> key<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.409> brackets<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you need you put the key in brackets so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
you need you put the key in brackets so
I'll<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.150> set<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.509> brackets<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.680> copy

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I'll make a set of brackets and you copy

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370 
I'll make a set of brackets and you copy
the<00:01:44.130> key<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the key in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.330 
the key in
right<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:48.149> will<00:01:48.420> tell<00:01:49.039> regedit<00:01:50.039> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
right here this will tell regedit to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
right here this will tell regedit to
create<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> key<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:52.170> long<00:01:52.469> as<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> key<00:01:52.860> isn't

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
create a key as long as the key isn't

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.510 
create a key as long as the key isn't
there<00:01:53.219> that<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> minus<00:01:55.740> before

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
there that is but you put a minus before

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.300 
there that is but you put a minus before
the<00:01:56.640> key<00:01:56.820> inside<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> brackets<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:59.039> is<00:01:59.189> now

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the key inside the brackets this is now

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.209 
the key inside the brackets this is now
going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> tell<00:01:59.850> regedit<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.720> remove<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> key<00:02:01.710> if

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
going to tell regedit to remove a key if

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.760 
going to tell regedit to remove a key if
I<00:02:02.310> wanted<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> remove<00:02:03.119> multiple<00:02:03.780> keys<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I wanted to remove multiple keys the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.660 
I wanted to remove multiple keys the
syntax<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.929> header<00:02:07.200> space<00:02:08.009> txt<00:02:09.000> space<00:02:10.670> too

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
syntax is the header space txt space too

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.870 
syntax is the header space txt space too
well<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.239> enters<00:02:12.660> new<00:02:13.530> text<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.580> we're<00:02:14.730> not

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.720 
remove values so pay attention it's
different<00:03:05.459> from<00:03:05.639> keys<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.130> put<00:03:08.400> your<00:03:08.549> key

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
different from keys so you put your key

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910 
different from keys so you put your key
