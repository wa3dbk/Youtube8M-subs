it's uninsulated and talked earlier
about<00:00:07.230> those<00:00:07.740> leaks<00:00:08.100> from<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> warm

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
about those leaks from the warm

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.999 
about those leaks from the warm
conditioned<00:00:09.179> space<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:10.200> into<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> attic

conditioned space up into the attic
space<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.370> happens<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.849> cold<00:00:12.360> air<00:00:12.540> leaks

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750

about<00:00:18.120> to<00:00:19.050> heat<00:00:19.290> the<00:00:19.680> air<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.700> air

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
about to heat the air and then the air

about to heat the air and then the air
if<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.450> leaks<00:00:21.750> into<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.170> attic<00:00:22.440> space

if there are leaks into the attic space
the<00:00:23.940> warm<00:00:24.120> air<00:00:24.300> will<00:00:24.420> leak<00:00:24.540> through<00:00:24.690> that

the warm air will leak through that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720 
the warm air will leak through that
ceiling<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> creates<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.250> chimney

in<00:00:30.510> number<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> concern<00:00:32.700> because

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in number one it's a concern because

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.260 
in number one it's a concern because
it's<00:00:33.150> an<00:00:33.240> energy<00:00:33.330> loss<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.050> number<00:00:34.530> two<00:00:35.270> when

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it's an energy loss and number two when

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.640 
it's an energy loss and number two when
this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> insulated<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.470> be

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
don't want warm air leaking up into here

don't want warm air leaking up into here
condensing<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.130> causing<00:00:56.700> moisture<00:00:57.390> buildup

once<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.399> run<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.670> structural

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
once again you can run into structural

issues and mold those are those are
really<00:01:02.220> big<00:01:02.399> concerns<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.940> don't<00:01:03.060> want<00:01:03.180> any<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
really big concerns we don't want any of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
really big concerns we don't want any of
that<00:01:03.450> going<00:01:03.720> on<00:01:03.810> in<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.049> home<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.470> we'll<00:01:05.220> get

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that going on in a home so we'll get

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
that going on in a home so we'll get
around<00:01:05.550> this<00:01:05.729> electrical<00:01:06.630> receptacle<00:01:07.229> where

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
around this electrical receptacle where

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
around this electrical receptacle where
the<00:01:07.440> wires<00:01:07.620> come<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.640> our<00:01:08.790> sealant<00:01:09.180> then

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the wires come in with our sealant then

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
the wires come in with our sealant then
we'll<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.570> around<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> box<00:01:10.080> itself<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.590> think

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
we'll go around the box itself I think

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.110 
we'll go around the box itself I think
with<00:01:10.950> foam<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.490> that'll<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:11.850> work

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
with foam I think that'll actually work

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.520 
with foam I think that'll actually work
a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.300> bit<00:01:12.450> better<00:01:15.260> so<00:01:16.260> we're<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.380> gonna

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a little bit better so we're just gonna

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.719 
a little bit better so we're just gonna
fill<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:22.460> we<00:01:23.460> filled<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.850> those<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.270> now

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
fill those in we filled all those in now

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.039 
fill those in we filled all those in now
when<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> spray<00:01:27.390> some<00:01:27.420> flow<00:01:27.810> around

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
when I take and spray some flow around

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
when I take and spray some flow around
this<00:01:29.040> box<00:01:29.400> itself<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.750> sealed

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this box itself to get that all sealed

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
this box itself to get that all sealed
up<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
up and that's about all there is to it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
up and that's about all there is to it
so<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:34.350> we'll<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.890> project<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so what we'll have on this project is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
so what we'll have on this project is
all<00:01:35.610> done<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.619> an<00:01:37.619> attic<00:01:37.890> space<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.780> got<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
all done is an attic space that's got a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.380 
all done is an attic space that's got a
vapor<00:01:40.049> barrier<00:01:40.170> down<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:41.729> keep<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> moisture

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
vapor barrier down to keep that moisture

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
vapor barrier down to keep that moisture
from<00:01:42.420> getting<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.200> condensing<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
from getting in here and condensing it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
from getting in here and condensing it
as<00:01:43.979> well<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.610> little<00:01:44.760> individual

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
as well as all these little individual

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.899 
as well as all these little individual
air<00:01:45.689> leaks<00:01:45.900> sealed<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.909> studies

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
air leaks sealed up and that's studies

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.310 
air leaks sealed up and that's studies
have<00:01:48.030> shown<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.510> where<00:01:48.659> most<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
have shown that that's where most of the
