00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cabin it seems like I got a lot of good

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.260 
cabin it seems like I got a lot of good
feedback<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.979> heavy<00:01:17.189> MDF<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.030> really

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
feedback on it it's heavy MDF is really

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
feedback on it it's heavy MDF is really
heavy<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> also<00:01:19.380> an<00:01:19.560> example<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
heavy but this is also an example of a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
heavy but this is also an example of a
job<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.830> MDF<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
job that I think that really MDF is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
job that I think that really MDF is
perfect<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> used<00:01:25.080> solid

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
perfect for because if you used solid

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.130 
perfect for because if you used solid
wood<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.159> solid<00:01:27.000> wood<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> you'd<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
wood and solid wood on it you'd have

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
wood and solid wood on it you'd have
problems<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:28.979> drawers<00:01:29.310> possibly

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
problems with these drawers possibly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
problems with these drawers possibly
expanding<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> contracting<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.770> getting

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
expanding and contracting and getting

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
expanding and contracting and getting
stuck<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> there<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.659> fit<00:01:33.990> pretty

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
stuck in there because they fit pretty

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
stuck in there because they fit pretty
snug<00:01:34.470> there's<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.549> room<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
snug there's not a lot of room for that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
snug there's not a lot of room for that
and<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> used<00:01:37.500> plywood<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and if you used plywood I think you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
and if you used plywood I think you
would<00:01:38.880> run<00:01:39.060> into<00:01:39.210> problems<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> edges

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
would run into problems with the edges

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
would run into problems with the edges
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> plywood<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.360> whereas<00:01:42.600> MDF<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
of the plywood you know whereas MDF I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.450 
of the plywood you know whereas MDF I
think<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.619> good<00:01:43.799> choice<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
think it's just a good choice for

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
think it's just a good choice for
something<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> want<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> thank

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
promotional bit I did for little bits

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
promotional bit I did for little bits
and<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.729> bits<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.990> cool<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> don't

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and little bits is really cool I don't

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
and little bits is really cool I don't
think<00:01:52.740> I've<00:01:52.799> ever<00:01:52.950> been<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
think I've ever been quite that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
think I've ever been quite that
fascinated<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.380> product<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.979> an<00:01:56.130> entire

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
fascinated in a product and an entire

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.539 
fascinated in a product and an entire
system<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> whole<00:01:58.829> idea<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
system just the whole idea of it it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.700 
system just the whole idea of it it's
just<00:01:59.610> open-source<00:02:00.270> hardware<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
just open-source hardware so that you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
just open-source hardware so that you
could<00:02:01.920> build<00:02:02.130> things<00:02:02.549> by<00:02:02.880> buying<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
could build things by buying the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.969 
could build things by buying the
components<00:02:04.229> already<00:02:04.380> made<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.860> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
components already made you don't have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
components already made you don't have
to<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.280> soldering<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to do any soldering and do all that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
to do any soldering and do all that
piddly<00:02:06.750> stuff<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.409> start<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
piddly stuff you could just start to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.660 
piddly stuff you could just start to
experiment<00:02:08.129> by

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
experiment by

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
experiment by
things<00:02:09.060> together<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.720> loud<00:02:09.990> birds<00:02:10.380> hear

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
things together really loud birds hear

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
things together really loud birds hear
that<00:02:13.790> anyways<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.209> concept<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that anyways I like the concept of the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.449 
that anyways I like the concept of the
open<00:02:16.230> source<00:02:16.440> name<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
open source name it would be kind of

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.680 
open source name it would be kind of
like<00:02:17.550> woodworking<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.239> had<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> build<00:02:18.599> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
like woodworking if I had to build a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.500 
like woodworking if I had to build a
table<00:02:18.930> saw<00:02:19.319> every<00:02:19.680> time<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:19.980> wanted<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.880> you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
table saw every time I wanted to you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
table saw every time I wanted to you
know<00:02:21.540> cut<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> pauper<00:02:22.590> daylight<00:02:23.010> got<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> tools

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
know cut a pauper daylight got the tools

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.360 
know cut a pauper daylight got the tools
and<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.180> put<00:02:24.300> stuff<00:02:24.510> together<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and I can just put stuff together the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
and I can just put stuff together the
only<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.060> birds<00:02:27.270> are<00:02:27.480> noisy<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
only time the birds are noisy is when I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.250 
only time the birds are noisy is when I
turn<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> camera<00:02:28.770> on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
turn the camera on

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.540 
turn the camera on
okay<00:02:31.260> I'm<00:02:31.380> back<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> pretty<00:02:32.250> seamless

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
okay I'm back that was a pretty seamless

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
up I'd have to go away and deal with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.460 
up I'd have to go away and deal with
that<00:02:44.850> or<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.569> was<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.840> getting<00:02:46.019> really<00:02:46.140> loud

my<00:02:49.560> neighbours<00:02:49.950> working<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.430> something<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
my neighbours working on something I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.729 
my neighbours working on something I
think<00:02:51.060> he's<00:02:51.150> building<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.569> gazebo<00:02:52.350> or

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
think he's building a gazebo or

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.470 
think he's building a gazebo or
something<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.880> him<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.030> building

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
something so good for him for building

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.630 
something so good for him for building
but<00:02:54.690> bad<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.230> me<00:02:55.590> shooting<00:02:56.010> because<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.549> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
but bad for me shooting because it's a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.759 
but bad for me shooting because it's a
lot<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.970> banging<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.630> grinding<00:02:58.080> going<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.530> but

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
lot of banging and grinding going on but

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.620 
lot of banging and grinding going on but
I<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.310> live<00:02:59.459> with<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.000> want<00:03:00.569> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
I think I can live with that I want to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.930 
I think I can live with that I want to
toggle<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> grinding<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:02.790> know<00:03:02.850> if

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
toggle your the grinding I don't know if

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.470 
toggle your the grinding I don't know if
you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.150> hear<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.360> on<00:03:03.569> there<00:03:04.110> now<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:05.420> want<00:03:06.420> to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you can hear it on there now I want to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.610 
you can hear it on there now I want to
talk<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.720> bit<00:03:06.840> about<00:03:06.930> woodworking<00:03:07.530> in

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
talk a little bit about woodworking in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.009 
talk a little bit about woodworking in
America<00:03:08.250> which<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.239> last<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:09.930> it's

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
America which was last we got well it's

collector<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.830> that

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
collector I think that

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.130 
collector I think that
kind<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.440> fun<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.890> see<00:04:21.400> all<00:04:21.550> of<00:04:21.580> that<00:04:21.700> stuff<00:04:22.210> and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
kind of fun to see all of that stuff and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.690 
kind of fun to see all of that stuff and
again<00:04:23.380> they<00:04:23.590> had<00:04:23.740> some<00:04:23.920> classes<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.610> classes

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
again they had some classes the classes

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.090 
again they had some classes the classes
were<00:04:25.120> also<00:04:25.540> geared<00:04:25.870> towards<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.770> high<00:04:26.950> end

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
were also geared towards really high end

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.920 
were also geared towards really high end
woodworking<00:04:27.580> for<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:28.060> average<00:04:28.240> garage

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
woodworking for the average garage

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.840 
woodworking for the average garage
woodworker<00:04:29.530> there's<00:04:29.860> really<00:04:30.070> not<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.340> much

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
woodworker there's really not that much

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.760 
woodworker there's really not that much
there<00:04:31.240> for<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.620> could<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.070> go<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
there for you you could just go to the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.440 
there for you you could just go to the
shopping<00:04:35.770> area<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.430> store<00:04:36.730> I<00:04:36.760> guess<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
shopping area the store I guess it is

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.660 
shopping area the store I guess it is
you<00:04:37.600> can<00:04:37.750> pay<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.530> shop<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.070> guess<00:04:39.400> and

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
you can pay this to shop I guess and

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.580 
you can pay this to shop I guess and
it's<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.240> think<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.540> was<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.720> $10<00:04:41.200> so<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.560> I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
it's I think I was like $10 so that I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.960 
it's I think I was like $10 so that I
guess<00:04:41.830> that's<00:04:42.010> fairly<00:04:42.220> reasonable<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:42.850> get

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
guess that's fairly reasonable you get

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.380 
guess that's fairly reasonable you get
to<00:04:43.060> talk<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.690> tool<00:04:44.530> companies<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.030> will<00:04:46.240> I

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
to talk to the tool companies so will I

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.860 
to talk to the tool companies so will I
go<00:04:46.570> next<00:04:47.050> year<00:04:47.550> maybe<00:04:48.550> I'm<00:04:49.030> not<00:04:49.210> really<00:04:49.450> sure

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
go next year maybe I'm not really sure

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.680
