in order to get stuff off so Scott into
a<00:03:58.640> really<00:03:58.790> good<00:03:58.970> card<00:03:59.180> right<00:03:59.390> now<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.750> think<00:04:00.760> d

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
a really good card right now I think d

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.050 
a really good card right now I think d
prison<00:04:02.530> Amir<00:04:03.530> force<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:04.040> don't<00:04:04.579> we<00:04:04.640> put<00:04:04.790> one<00:04:04.940> D

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
prison Amir force I don't we put one D

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.720 
prison Amir force I don't we put one D
prison<00:04:05.390> uh<00:04:05.900> if<00:04:06.769> I'd<00:04:06.920> room<00:04:07.130> for<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.489> other<00:04:07.640> one

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
prison uh if I'd room for the other one

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.870 
prison uh if I'd room for the other one
I<00:04:07.940> really<00:04:08.950> some<00:04:09.950> people<00:04:10.160> are<00:04:10.250> starting<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.640> cut

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
I really some people are starting to cut

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.640 
I really some people are starting to cut
out<00:04:11.000> mirror<00:04:11.209> force<00:04:11.450> but<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.170> think<00:04:12.350> mirror

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
out mirror force but I think mirror

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.440 
out mirror force but I think mirror
force<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.250> good<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:14.000> basically<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
force is really good it's basically the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.630 
force is really good it's basically the
same<00:04:14.570> thing<00:04:14.630> as<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> prison<00:04:15.320> like<00:04:15.470> they<00:04:16.070> can't

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
same thing as the prison like they can't

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.099 
same thing as the prison like they can't
negate<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.060> unless<00:04:17.239> they<00:04:17.390> have<00:04:17.419> like<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.750> dark

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
negate it unless they have like a dark

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.229 
negate it unless they have like a dark
bribe<00:04:18.349> or<00:04:18.560> something<00:04:18.859> or<00:04:18.979> start<00:04:19.310> us<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:19.669> even

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
bribe or something or start us but even

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.410 
bribe or something or start us but even
then<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.510> gets<00:04:20.570> rid<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.840> the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
then it gets rid of the

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.040 
then it gets rid of the
I<00:04:21.480> think<00:04:22.370> if<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.670> were<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.940> find<00:04:24.120> room<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.330> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
I think if I were to find room for the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.750 
I think if I were to find room for the
second<00:04:25.560> d<00:04:25.620> prison<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.070> would<00:04:26.190> cut<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> hero

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
second d prison I would cut out a hero

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.850 
second d prison I would cut out a hero
blast<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:27.630> right<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.110> blast<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.620> really

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
blast but right now here blast is really

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.190 
blast but right now here blast is really
good<00:04:28.980> for<00:04:29.100> me<00:04:29.220> because<00:04:29.510> all<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.660> fire<00:04:30.840> fists

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
good for me because all the fire fists

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.780 
good for me because all the fire fists
and<00:04:31.290> other<00:04:31.440> injectors<00:04:31.890> are<00:04:32.010> less<00:04:32.160> than<00:04:32.280> 19<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
and other injectors are less than 19 and

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.770 
and other injectors are less than 19 and
