00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
easy we'll start off with the basic
sugar<00:00:12.840> push<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.769> can<00:00:13.920> link<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
sugar push so you can link one to the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
sugar push so you can link one to the
other<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.369> two<00:00:17.420> one<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> two<00:00:19.410> she

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
other we just do one two one and two she

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
other we just do one two one and two she
anchored<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.760> two<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:22.529> she<00:00:22.710> does<00:00:22.890> her

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
anchored one and two now as she does her

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
anchored one and two now as she does her
next<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.970> where<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> would<00:00:24.539> normally<00:00:24.689> pull

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
next one to where I would normally pull

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
next one to where I would normally pull
back<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.920> I'm<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> pull<00:00:27.119> her<00:00:27.240> forward<00:00:27.570> as

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
