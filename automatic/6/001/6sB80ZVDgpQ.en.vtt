dry you know skin so I do have to add
like<00:05:22.040> extra<00:05:22.610> primer<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.810> area<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:24.560> that

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
like extra primer to that area so that

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.830 
like extra primer to that area so that
this<00:05:24.860> doesn't<00:05:25.160> look<00:05:25.460> like<00:05:25.700> super<00:05:26.240> like<00:05:26.480> dry

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
this doesn't look like super like dry

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.220 
this doesn't look like super like dry
because<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.710> is<00:05:27.830> matte<00:05:28.130> tube<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.640> I<00:05:29.060> do<00:05:29.930> like

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
because it is matte tube and I do like

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.080 
because it is matte tube and I do like
it<00:05:30.260> overall<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:30.890> think<00:05:31.130> if<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.520> work<00:05:31.700> with<00:05:31.730> it

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090
