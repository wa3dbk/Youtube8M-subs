00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
more natural environment currently

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.249 
more natural environment currently
that's<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> yes<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.780> site<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that's it yes we are the one site in the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
that's it yes we are the one site in the
country<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:23.130> feed<00:01:23.880> kites<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
country that doesn't feed kites and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710 
country that doesn't feed kites and
therefore<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.040> natural<00:01:26.640> ill<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
therefore is a lot more natural ill it's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
therefore is a lot more natural ill it's
like<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.140> farm<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.740> nice<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like you can farm very nice but it is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179
