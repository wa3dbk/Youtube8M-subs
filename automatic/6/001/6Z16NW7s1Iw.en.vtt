00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.300
 to find the greatest common divisor 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.150
 of a set of numbers there is a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.180
 simple trick that we can use 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 decompose those into prime numbers 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 remember that the prime numbers are 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 those that are only divisible by themselves 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.470
 themselves and by number one as is the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.060
 case from 2 to 3 to 5 to 7 to 11 and so on 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 observe suppose we want 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.510
 find out the greatest common divisor of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.789
 2016 and 32 is to say the largest number 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 by which you can divide all those 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.670
 numbers and that the result is a number 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.829
 whole this last one is very important 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.250
 because it would not be valid for us to divide 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.739
 12 between 5 since the result does not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 would give an exact number but something like 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.620
 2.4 and that number does not help us to say 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.879
 that 5 is divisor of 12 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.510
 we will start by writing the numbers of the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.290
 set that we need that is 12 16 and 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.850
 32 and next the first prime number is 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.250
 say number 2 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.159
 with it what we want to find out is if 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 all numbers are divisible by 2 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.469
 we see that 12/2 is equal to 6 16 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.399
 divided is equal to 8 and that 32 divided 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.170
 2 is equal to 16 now we see again 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.039
 serves us the 2 to divide the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 results is to say halves we see 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:46.200
 that if since 6 divided 2 equals 38 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.230
 divided 2 is equal to 4 and 16 divided 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.630
 is equal to 8 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.090
 by checking again if the 2 is us 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.090
 useful we see that it serves us for 4 and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.270
 for the 8 but for the 3 it does not work anymore 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.550
 because 3 does not have half we will look 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.640
 then the prime number jezik that is the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.310
 3 helps us to continue seeing all the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.530
 numbers but we see that the 3 only serves 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 precisely at 3 and the others do not 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.989
 and there forward no prime number 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.270
 it does not serve to divide the numbers 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.420
 remaining so it's time to 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.010
 stop the final step will be multiply 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 the numbers that were left next to us 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.720
 straight 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.610
 that is, we must multiply 2 by 2 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.459
 as a result of that operation is 4 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.430
 So that means that 4 is the maximum 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.430
 common divisor for 12 16 and 32 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 in case we had more than two 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.560
 numbers on the right will be necessary 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.560
 multiply them all 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.590
 For example, suppose we were 2 2 2 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.560
 and 3 in this case we should do what 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.989
 next multiply 2 by 2 and then 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.830
 result for the next 2 and so 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.120
 successively 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.310
 in this case 2 by 2 equals 4 4 by 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.990
 2 is equal to 8 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.670
 and 8 for 13 5 to 24 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.260
 24 would then be our common maximum 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.030
 divider
