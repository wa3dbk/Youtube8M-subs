00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so the goat hair is a little bit stiffer

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.399 
so the goat hair is a little bit stiffer
so<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.640> applying<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.360> product<00:02:01.020> that's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
so when you're applying a product that's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
so when you're applying a product that's
going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> give<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:03.240> of

going to give you a different way of
applying<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.219> softer<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
applying it you know the the softer it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
applying it you know the the softer it
is<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> sheer<00:02:07.560> coverage

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is the more kind of sheer coverage

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740 
is the more kind of sheer coverage
you're<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.789> from<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> product<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you're going to get from the product the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.270 
you're going to get from the product the
lighter<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> place<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.979> onto<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
lighter it's going to place it onto the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.760 
lighter it's going to place it onto the
skin

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
skin

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.100 
skin
and<00:02:11.890> then<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> goat<00:02:13.150> hair<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.990> to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
and then the goat hair one it's going to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.890 
and then the goat hair one it's going to
place<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.460> bit<00:02:15.670> firmer<00:02:16.300> onto<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
place it a little bit firmer onto the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.210 
place it a little bit firmer onto the
skin<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.200> you're<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.100> little

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
skin and you're going to get a little

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.250 
skin and you're going to get a little
bit<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.520> coverage<00:02:18.790> from<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.630> that's<00:02:20.050> kind

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
bit more coverage from it so that's kind

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.480 
bit more coverage from it so that's kind
of<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> difference<00:02:20.560> between<00:02:20.950> these<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.430> it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
of the difference between these so it

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.740 
of the difference between these so it
just<00:02:21.640> depends<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.060> how<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.690> your

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
just depends on how you like your

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.040 
just depends on how you like your
product<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:24.100> be<00:02:24.390> delivered<00:02:25.390> onto<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> skin

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
product to be delivered onto the skin

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.110 
product to be delivered onto the skin
and<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.410> kind<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.710> hard<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.220> talk<00:02:27.610> about<00:02:27.910> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and it's kind of hard to talk about that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.420 
and it's kind of hard to talk about that
in<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.450> video<00:02:28.620> besides<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> give<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.400> the
