00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.199 
and just spritz a little bit more out on
there<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> pretty<00:02:43.700> cool<00:02:43.910> process

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
there this this is a pretty cool process

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.390 
there this this is a pretty cool process
because<00:02:45.050> most<00:02:45.470> stains<00:02:45.800> once<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.100> put<00:02:46.310> them

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
because most stains once you put them

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670 
because most stains once you put them
down<00:02:46.610> that's<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:47.120> they're<00:02:47.390> down<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.350> allows

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
down that's it they're down this allows

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.070 
down that's it they're down this allows
you<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.950> move<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.310> around<00:02:49.660> you've<00:02:50.660> got<00:02:50.690> quite<00:02:51.019> a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
you to move it around you've got quite a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.009 
you to move it around you've got quite a
bit<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.430> open<00:02:52.430> time<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.180> usually

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
bit of open time on it I usually

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.259 
bit of open time on it I usually
recommend<00:02:54.530> three<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> six<00:02:55.400> hours<00:02:55.730> after<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
recommend three to six hours after that

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.780 
recommend three to six hours after that
you<00:02:56.600> want<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> stay<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.680> stuff<00:02:58.489> trying

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
to move it around between six and twelve

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.620 
to move it around between six and twelve
hours<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.310> going<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.519> set<00:03:01.790> up<00:03:01.970> between<00:03:02.180> 12

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
hours it's going to set up between 12

we put an extension on it and he's just
burnishing<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.720> straight<00:05:09.140> in<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.860> method

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
burnishing it straight in this method

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.300 
burnishing it straight in this method
gives<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> lot<00:05:10.910> more<00:05:10.940> opaque<00:05:11.980> look<00:05:12.980> when

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
gives you a lot more opaque look when

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.100 
gives you a lot more opaque look when
you're<00:05:13.460> done<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.790> other<00:05:13.940> words<00:05:14.180> some<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:15.050> the

other methods when you're using the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.370 
other methods when you're using the
machine<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:17.090> in<00:05:17.270> water<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.840> move<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.140> around

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
machine and in water to move it around

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.990 
machine and in water to move it around
it's<00:05:19.250> going<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.460> give<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:19.640> a<00:05:19.700> little<00:05:19.910> more

it's going to give you a little more
translucent<00:05:20.570> look<00:05:21.730> you<00:05:22.730> can<00:05:23.000> use<00:05:23.510> either

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
translucent look you can use either
