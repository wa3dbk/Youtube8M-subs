thousand watt eliminator it's replacing
my<00:00:12.660> old<00:00:13.490> modified<00:00:14.490> sine-wave

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
my old modified sine-wave

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.650 
my old modified sine-wave
1500<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:17.270> lost<00:00:18.410> 500<00:00:19.410> watt<00:00:19.650> watt<00:00:20.430> reading<00:00:20.939> but

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
1500 I lost 500 watt watt reading but

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.040 
1500 I lost 500 watt watt reading but
this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> pure<00:00:22.289> sine-wave<00:00:23.420> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> load

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this is pure sine-wave this is the load

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.609 
this is pure sine-wave this is the load
and<00:00:25.500> load<00:00:25.949> drop<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.570> little<00:00:28.109> halogen

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and load drop with a little halogen

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.630 
and load drop with a little halogen
light<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.099> mean<00:00:29.689> fluorescent<00:00:30.689> light<00:00:31.640> it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
light I mean fluorescent light it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
light I mean fluorescent light it's
probably<00:00:33.090> close<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.660> amp<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.110> thing's<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
probably close to an amp this thing's a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.780 
probably close to an amp this thing's a
little<00:00:34.920> inaccurate<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.610> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
little inaccurate but I got actually be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.910 
little inaccurate but I got actually be
a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.420> oscilloscope<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:41.540> showing<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
a little oscilloscope here showing the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
a little oscilloscope here showing the
sine<00:00:43.920> wave<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.329> nice<00:00:45.480> sine<00:00:45.780> wave

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
sine wave it is a very nice sine wave

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.160 
sine wave it is a very nice sine wave
that<00:00:46.760> glitching<00:00:47.760> around<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.300> normal<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that glitching around it is normal it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
that glitching around it is normal it's
just<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.520> high<00:00:51.559> sample

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just I have it on a very high sample

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.029 
just I have it on a very high sample
rate<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:54.379> doing<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.770> funny

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
rate so it's doing a little bit funny

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.760 
rate so it's doing a little bit funny
stuff<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.480> makes<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
stuff but it makes it so I can see that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.630 
stuff but it makes it so I can see that
what<00:00:59.550> happens<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> sine<00:01:00.449> wave<00:01:00.629> better

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
what happens to the sine wave better

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.890 
what happens to the sine wave better
yeah<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:04.400> first<00:01:05.400> off<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.180> angle

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
yeah so first off I have this angle

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
yeah so first off I have this angle
grinder<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:11.090> here<00:01:12.740> take<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:15.979> 6<00:01:16.979> amps<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
grinder it's here take here 6 amps and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.899 
grinder it's here take here 6 amps and
this<00:01:18.210> inverter<00:01:18.830> provides<00:01:19.830> seven<00:01:20.400> eight<00:01:20.520> point

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this inverter provides seven eight point

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.050 
this inverter provides seven eight point
two<00:01:21.119> amps<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.720> believe<00:01:21.960> anyways<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.700> let's<00:01:23.729> see

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
two amps I believe anyways so let's see

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.640 
two amps I believe anyways so let's see
if<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.810> sine<00:01:25.140> wave<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.560> what

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
if we can see this sine wave and what

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:42.990 
if we can see this sine wave and what
happens<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.840> turn<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.290 

so<00:01:44.110> seems<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.380> run<00:01:45.830> pretty<00:01:46.100> good<00:01:46.310> goes<00:01:47.120> a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
so seems to run pretty good goes a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.910 
so seems to run pretty good goes a
little<00:01:47.510> bit<00:01:47.690> funky<00:01:47.930> at<00:01:48.170> first<00:01:48.440> when<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.890> first

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
little bit funky at first when you first

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.480 
little bit funky at first when you first
stir<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.490> up<00:01:49.990> other<00:01:50.990> than<00:01:51.230> that<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:52.070> runs<00:01:52.220> great

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
stir it up other than that it runs great

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
stir it up other than that it runs great
I<00:01:53.080> think<00:01:54.080> it's<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.920> great<00:01:55.490> improvement<00:01:55.670> I'm

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
I think it's a great improvement I'm

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.860 
I think it's a great improvement I'm
thinking<00:01:57.440> about<00:01:57.590> trying<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.980> AC<00:01:58.660> yeah<00:01:59.660> let's

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
thinking about trying the AC yeah let's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.780 
thinking about trying the AC yeah let's
try<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.140> easy<00:02:00.430> why<00:02:01.430> not<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.610> see

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
try the easy why not like that you see

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.130 
try the easy why not like that you see
in<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.060> see<00:02:05.180> what<00:02:05.300> happened<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.870> sine

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
in and see what happened to the sine

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.609 
in and see what happened to the sine
wave<00:02:06.350> my<00:02:07.240> modified<00:02:08.240> sine<00:02:08.660> wave<00:02:08.899> inverter<00:02:09.110> did

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
wave my modified sine wave inverter did

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:23.800 
wave my modified sine wave inverter did
not<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.120> test<00:02:16.510> whoa<00:02:17.540> Oh<00:02:22.630> hopefully<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
not like this test whoa Oh hopefully I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.110 
not like this test whoa Oh hopefully I
didn't<00:02:23.990> wreck<00:02:24.110> anything<00:02:24.430> let's<00:02:25.430> find<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:26.770> no

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
didn't wreck anything let's find out no

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.360 
didn't wreck anything let's find out no
working<00:02:29.120> good<00:02:29.530> okay<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.590> what<00:02:30.860> happened<00:02:31.220> there

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
working good okay so what happened there

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.550 
working good okay so what happened there
was<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:33.130> connected<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.720> then<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.110> wiggled

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
was I connected it and then it wiggled

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.940 
was I connected it and then it wiggled
loose<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:38.360> connected<00:02:39.260> again<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
loose and then connected again so the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.790 
loose and then connected again so the
the<00:02:40.790> stinking<00:02:43.840> compressor<00:02:44.840> started<00:02:45.290> and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
the stinking compressor started and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.650 
the stinking compressor started and
stopped<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.730> was<00:02:46.850> under<00:02:47.060> pressure<00:02:47.270> didn't

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
stopped and it was under pressure didn't

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.630 
stopped and it was under pressure didn't
start<00:02:47.900> again<00:02:48.110> let's<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:49.100> if<00:02:49.190> they'll<00:02:49.340> start

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
start again let's see if they'll start

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.880 
start again let's see if they'll start
this<00:02:49.760> time<00:02:50.709> okay

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this time okay

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.080 
this time okay
so<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.580> running<00:02:53.350> at

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
so it's running at

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.250 
so it's running at
here's<00:02:56.660> our<00:02:56.900> what's<00:02:57.500> their<00:02:58.120> stuff<00:02:59.120> oh<00:02:59.390> here<00:03:00.200> we

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
here's our what's their stuff oh here we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.870 
here's our what's their stuff oh here we
go<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.010> what<00:03:01.190> we<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.520> see<00:03:03.880> why

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
go this is what we want to see why

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.150 
go this is what we want to see why
discourse<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.510> dim

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:18.980 

you<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:10.000> that

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:29.980 

no<00:03:19.530> no<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.330> think<00:03:21.330> my<00:03:21.480> battery's<00:03:21.870> going<00:03:22.080> to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:38.580 

I<00:03:30.520> said<00:03:31.520> witness<00:03:31.940> up<00:03:32.090> again

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.120 

yep<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.550> just<00:03:40.090> died

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
yep I just died

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.720 
look good when I was ringing this thing
that<00:03:46.380> looked<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.680> same<00:03:46.830> as<00:03:47.190> when<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:47.610> was

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that looked the same as when it was

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.040 
that looked the same as when it was
running<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.210> thing<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:51.510> runs<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.870> lot

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
running this thing so and it runs a lot

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.820 
running this thing so and it runs a lot
quieter<00:03:52.580> then<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> modified<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.740> think<00:03:55.740> it

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
quieter then on the modified I think it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.410 
quieter then on the modified I think it
runs<00:03:55.920> more<00:03:56.160> efficient<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.820> guys<00:03:57.030> I'm<00:03:57.240> only
