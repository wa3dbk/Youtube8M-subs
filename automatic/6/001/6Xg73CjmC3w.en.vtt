made<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> aluminum

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
made out of aluminum

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
made out of aluminum
seems<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.659> feels<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.930> aluminum<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
seems like feels like aluminum and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
probably going to hang down further than

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.359 
probably going to hang down further than
that<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.869> easier<00:01:19.369> access

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

direction

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.860 
direction
so<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:20.930> will<00:04:21.110> look<00:04:21.230> at<00:04:22.450> direction<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.630> one's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
so I will look at direction that one's

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.190 
so I will look at direction that one's
in<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.350> looks<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.950> goes<00:04:26.770> like<00:04:27.770> that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
in and it looks like it goes like that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.710 
in and it looks like it goes like that
that's<00:04:30.200> how<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:30.560> gonna<00:04:30.650> go<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:32.390> I'll<00:04:32.480> take

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
that's how it's gonna go in so I'll take

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.820 
that's how it's gonna go in so I'll take
this<00:04:32.900> out<00:04:33.170> slow<00:04:34.480> make<00:04:35.480> sure<00:04:35.660> nothing<00:04:35.930> pops<00:04:36.560> out

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
this out slow make sure nothing pops out

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.410 
this out slow make sure nothing pops out
on<00:04:37.010> your<00:04:37.220> hand<00:04:37.370> Springs<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:37.940> on<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.240> because

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
that would suck and there is the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.690 
that would suck and there is the
selector<00:04:41.600> switch<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.200> then<00:04:43.100> here<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.460> new

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
selector switch and then here is the new

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.720 
selector switch and then here is the new
one<00:04:43.960> it's<00:04:44.960> way<00:04:45.200> bigger<00:04:45.440> way<00:04:45.770> longer<00:04:46.280> okay

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
one it's way bigger way longer okay

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.800 
one it's way bigger way longer okay
system<00:04:47.180> upgrade<00:04:48.640> there's<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:49.670> pin<00:04:49.970> here<00:04:50.240> and

system upgrade there's a pin here and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.260 
system upgrade there's a pin here and
there's<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.020> spring<00:04:51.410> under<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.830> just<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:53.240> that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270

see<00:06:19.540> I<00:06:19.840> have<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.560> in<00:06:20.800> there<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:23.350> comes<00:06:23.560> down<00:06:23.770> a

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
see I have it in there it comes down a

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.850 
see I have it in there it comes down a
lot<00:06:24.100> further<00:06:24.610> and<00:06:25.440> hopefully<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.530> won't<00:06:26.650> get

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
lot further and hopefully you won't get

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.800 
lot further and hopefully you won't get
in<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:26.950> way<00:06:27.010> we'll<00:06:27.310> see<00:06:27.550> I<00:06:27.850> didn't<00:06:28.540> take<00:06:28.690> to

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
in the way we'll see I didn't take to

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.050 
in the way we'll see I didn't take to
screw<00:06:29.020> home<00:06:29.290> yet<00:06:29.670> since<00:06:30.670> there's<00:06:30.850> a<00:06:30.910> lock
