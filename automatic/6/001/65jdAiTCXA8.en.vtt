00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay so now what we're going to do is

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay so now what we're going to do is
make<00:00:03.270> some<00:00:03.570> suppositories<00:00:04.609> so<00:00:06.109> again

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
make some suppositories so again

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.860 
make some suppositories so again
whatever<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.919> prescribed<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.719> we're

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
whatever is prescribed is what we're

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.879 
whatever is prescribed is what we're
going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> mix<00:00:10.290> into<00:00:10.500> our<00:00:11.099> coconut<00:00:11.400> oil<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
going to mix into our coconut oil and

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.730 
going to mix into our coconut oil and
coconut<00:00:13.889> oil<00:00:15.260> at<00:00:16.260> room<00:00:16.560> temperature<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:18.740> pasty

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
coconut oil at room temperature is pasty

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.519 
coconut oil at room temperature is pasty
okay<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.240> might<00:00:21.449> look<00:00:21.689> solid<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.380> it's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
okay so this might look solid but it's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.480 
okay so this might look solid but it's
actually<00:00:22.920> quite<00:00:23.869> pasty<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.310> take

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
actually quite pasty so you just take

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.920 
actually quite pasty so you just take
out<00:00:26.699> whatever<00:00:26.939> amount<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.779> you're

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
out whatever amount you think you're

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
out whatever amount you think you're
going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.580> place<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> shot

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
going to use place it into the shot

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to use place it into the shot
glass<00:00:31.009> then<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> shot<00:00:32.730> glass<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
glass then I take the shot glass and I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.139 
glass then I take the shot glass and I
put<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.870> hot<00:00:34.230> tap<00:00:34.739> water<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> isn't

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
put it into hot tap water so this isn't

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.540 
put it into hot tap water so this isn't
boiled<00:00:39.660> water<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.230> hot<00:00:40.620> tap<00:00:40.980> water<00:00:41.120> and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
boiled water it's just hot tap water and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.529 
boiled water it's just hot tap water and
you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.840> that's<00:00:45.840> already<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:47.010> quickly

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
you can see that's already very quickly

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.310 
you can see that's already very quickly
melting<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> melt

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.740 

and<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.400> into<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:56.000> whatever<00:00:56.420> is

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
and then into that whatever is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.170 
and then into that whatever is
prescribed<00:00:57.260> for<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.070> suppository<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.940> take

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
prescribed for the suppository you take

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.930 
prescribed for the suppository you take
your<00:00:59.390> essential<00:00:59.840> oils<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.520> then<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:01.670> drop

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
your essential oils and then you drop

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:15.800 
your essential oils and then you drop
them<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.420> mixture

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.450 

you<00:01:16.680> mix<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.990> again<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> melts<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you mix that up again it melts in the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
you mix that up again it melts in the
warm<00:01:20.490> water<00:01:23.960> shot<00:01:24.960> glass<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:25.950> it's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
warm water shot glass it's because it's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
warm water shot glass it's because it's
glass<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:27.420> easy<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.899> work<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
glass very easy to work with and the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.810 
glass very easy to work with and the
oils<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.729> react<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> glass<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> now

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
oils don't react with the glass so now

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.760 
oils don't react with the glass so now
we've<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.240> completely<00:01:34.909> melted<00:01:35.909> liquid

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
we've got completely melted liquid

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
we've got completely melted liquid
coconut<00:01:37.770> oil<00:01:39.350> next<00:01:40.350> you'll<00:01:40.829> take<00:01:41.070> your

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
coconut oil next you'll take your

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.020 
coconut oil next you'll take your
syringe<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.439> draw<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.670> appropriate

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
syringe and you draw up the appropriate

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.570 
syringe and you draw up the appropriate
size<00:01:48.690> suppository<00:01:49.679> for<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.069> elbow<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
size suppository for the elbow that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.929 
size suppository for the elbow that
you're<00:01:50.759> looking<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> use<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.700> next<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
you're looking to use one in next what I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.469 
you're looking to use one in next what I
do<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.959> I<00:01:55.200> draw<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.770> air<00:01:56.189> while<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.000> holding<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
do is I draw in air while I'm holding it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.419 
do is I draw in air while I'm holding it
upright<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.959> place<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:02.069> the

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
upright and I place that into the

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.449 
upright and I place that into the
refrigerator<00:02:02.720> or<00:02:03.720> freezer<00:02:04.130> depending<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.250> how

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
refrigerator or freezer depending on how

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.669 
refrigerator or freezer depending on how
long<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.819> want<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.209> to<00:02:06.390> last<00:02:06.599> and<00:02:07.080> they're

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
long I want them to last and they're

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.780 
long I want them to last and they're
ready<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.039> use<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.940> course<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> label<00:02:09.780> them

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
ready for use and of course I label them

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.039 
ready for use and of course I label them
because<00:02:11.790> I'm<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.390> show<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.900> do

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
because I'm going to show you what we do

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:22.310 
because I'm going to show you what we do
next<00:02:13.319> after<00:02:13.620> they<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.160> hardened<00:02:20.359> and<00:02:21.359> so<00:02:21.630> when

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
next after they are hardened and so when

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.229 
next after they are hardened and so when
you<00:02:22.440> come<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> refrigerator<00:02:23.640> like

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you come out of the refrigerator like

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.460 
you come out of the refrigerator like
this<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.769> they're<00:02:25.950> hardened<00:02:27.470> suppository

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
this so they're hardened suppository

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.479 
this so they're hardened suppository
that<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.579> you<00:02:29.820> saw<00:02:30.030> will<00:02:30.329> melt<00:02:30.540> very<00:02:30.840> easily<00:02:31.489> at

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
that as you saw will melt very easily at

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.690 
that as you saw will melt very easily at
body<00:02:32.910> heat<00:02:33.209> which<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:33.989> what<00:02:34.400> tap<00:02:35.400> water

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
body heat which is about what tap water

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.539 
body heat which is about what tap water
is<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.920> these<00:02:38.069> will<00:02:38.250> melt

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
is so you can see that these will melt

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.020 
is so you can see that these will melt
very<00:02:39.200> quickly<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:41.069> there's<00:02:41.370> two<00:02:41.579> ways<00:02:41.609> to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
very quickly and there's two ways to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.449 
very quickly and there's two ways to
administer<00:02:42.739> sometimes<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.310> actually

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
administer sometimes you can actually

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.039 
administer sometimes you can actually
squeeze<00:02:45.120> through<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.810> syringe<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
squeeze through the syringe which is

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.449 
squeeze through the syringe which is
once<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.290> warmed<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:50.100> little<00:02:50.130> bit

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
once it's warmed up just a little bit

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.979 
once it's warmed up just a little bit
you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.730> hold<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.329> your<00:02:51.450> hand<00:02:52.370> or<00:02:53.989> you

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
you can just hold it in your hand or you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.479 
you can just hold it in your hand or you
can<00:02:55.139> go<00:02:55.260> ahead<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.709> chop<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.100> end<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
can go ahead and chop the end of the

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.009 
can go ahead and chop the end of the
syringe<00:02:56.730> off<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.459> hence<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.480> put<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> air<00:03:00.989> in

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
syringe off so hence I put the air in

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.879 
syringe off so hence I put the air in
there<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:02.579> just<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> come<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.889> chop

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
there so I'm just going to come in chop

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.759 
there so I'm just going to come in chop
the<00:03:05.069> end<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:07.380> I'm<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the end off and then I'm going to

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.390 
the end off and then I'm going to
administer<00:03:08.690> by<00:03:09.690> putting<00:03:10.130> lubrication<00:03:11.130> there

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.539 

the<00:03:14.400> suppository<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.950> then<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.069> course<00:03:17.130> throw

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
the suppository and then of course throw

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.120 
the suppository and then of course throw
the<00:03:17.700> syringe<00:03:18.030> away<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:20.220> as<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.910> see<00:03:22.130> this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
the syringe away and as you can see this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.280 
the syringe away and as you can see this
suppository

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
suppository

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.170 
suppository
we'll<00:03:25.890> begin<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.370> melt<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.819> release<00:03:29.819> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
we'll begin to melt and release the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.449 
we'll begin to melt and release the
coconut<00:03:30.629> oil<00:03:31.129> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.510> essential<00:03:34.049> oil<00:03:34.459> very

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
coconut oil in the essential oil very

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.170 
coconut oil in the essential oil very
quickly<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.750> these<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.110> very<00:03:37.349> quick<00:03:37.650> acting

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
quickly so these are very quick acting

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:49.840 
quickly so these are very quick acting
suppositories

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.920 

okay

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
okay

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.030 
okay
and<00:03:52.470> again<00:03:52.769> sometimes<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:53.760> take<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
and again sometimes you can take and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.160 
and again sometimes you can take and
it's<00:03:56.360> just<00:03:57.360> harder<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.989> push<00:03:58.860> through<00:04:00.170> you

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
it's just harder to push through you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.069 
it's just harder to push through you
know<00:04:01.260> warming<00:04:01.650> up<00:04:01.769> enough<00:04:02.599> to<00:04:03.599> push<00:04:03.870> it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
know warming up enough to push it

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.349 
know warming up enough to push it
through<00:04:07.099> that's<00:04:08.099> see<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.760> not<00:04:08.909> warming<00:04:09.239> up

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
through that's see it's not warming up

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.610 
through that's see it's not warming up
enough<00:04:10.159> so<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:12.480> why<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:13.019> leave<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.379> air

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
enough so that's why we leave that air

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.699 
enough so that's why we leave that air
pocket<00:04:13.859> at<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.310> top<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.109> can<00:04:16.259> cut<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.470> off

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
pocket at the top so we can cut it off

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.420 
pocket at the top so we can cut it off
like<00:04:16.949> we<00:04:17.130> did<00:04:17.280> with<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.549> one<00:04:19.549> okay<00:04:22.430> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
like we did with this one okay and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.210 
like we did with this one okay and
that's<00:04:24.030> basically<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.900> making<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.860> a

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that's basically the making of a

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.050 
that's basically the making of a
suppository<00:04:30.050> okay
