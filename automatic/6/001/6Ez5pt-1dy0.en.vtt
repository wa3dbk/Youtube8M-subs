00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
okay is my 180 Ellis one conversion

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.450 
okay is my 180 Ellis one conversion
initial<00:00:06.790> first<00:00:07.090> try<00:00:07.389> to<00:00:07.450> start<00:00:07.809> it<00:00:08.190> then<00:00:09.190> how

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
initial first try to start it then how

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.330 
initial first try to start it then how
it's<00:00:09.610> going<00:00:09.760> to<00:00:09.790> go<00:00:10.770> I'm<00:00:11.770> hoping<00:00:11.980> if<00:00:12.250> it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
it's going to go I'm hoping if it

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.880 
it's going to go I'm hoping if it
catches<00:00:12.550> fire<00:00:13.000> at<00:00:13.900> least<00:00:13.960> I<00:00:14.170> got<00:00:14.260> on<00:00:14.380> video<00:00:14.650> but

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
catches fire at least I got on video but

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.429 
catches fire at least I got on video but
on<00:00:15.040> I<00:00:15.220> don't<00:00:15.490> want<00:00:15.610> it<00:00:15.670> to<00:00:15.730> catch<00:00:15.880> fire<00:00:16.439> so

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
on I don't want it to catch fire so

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.130 
on I don't want it to catch fire so
prime<00:00:18.190> the<00:00:18.220> oil<00:00:18.610> as<00:00:19.119> best<00:00:19.390> I<00:00:19.510> can<00:00:19.750> because<00:00:19.990> the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
prime the oil as best I can because the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.420 
prime the oil as best I can because the

I<00:00:24.789> can<00:00:25.029> power<00:00:25.570> steering<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:27.180> I've<00:00:28.180> glued<00:00:28.630> fuel

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
I can power steering and I've glued fuel

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.570 
I can power steering and I've glued fuel
pressure<00:00:29.170> up<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.500> there's<00:00:29.619> no<00:00:29.740> leak<00:00:29.949> so<00:00:30.250> let's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
pressure up in there's no leak so let's

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:57.410 
pressure up in there's no leak so let's
see<00:00:30.699> here<00:00:30.850> we<00:00:30.910> go<00:00:37.800> startup<00:00:38.800> test<00:00:39.100> one
