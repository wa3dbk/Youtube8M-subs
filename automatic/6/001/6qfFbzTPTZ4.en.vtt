00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.060
 well 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 new appointment with h24 bar in this 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.240
 morning together to comment on the themes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 We liked the day on Rome 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.009
 matteo guest vespasian dump hello 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 say hello to all speakers were 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.000
 united for nine years we are very much one 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 season really went into 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.580
 hurry I have to say yes they really did fly 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.680
 that by the way I spoke just a few 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.910
 day ago I said that it is impressive if 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 I really think about it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 and young day region now family 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.610
 21 now the gubbio with matteo and i 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.200
 last two years have been a bit like that 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.590
 particular and screams both ways two 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.230
 true for a certain detail I must say that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 they didn't even make us scream 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 so much more than anything else we have 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.910
 designed for so many goals 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
 but then if the years do well as well 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.899
 year ago the reforms depress us the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.759
 heat problem moment because it rags 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.690
 we certainly screamed these then 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.340
 let's start with 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.930
 where is the atavistic problem not only of the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.970
 rome because in other words not for charity 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.090
 we are victims and a bit of everyone 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.890
 the national grits if you well know if you have 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.420
 some physical problems 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.210
 a round of international matches 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.180
 Crusades companies say that because matthew 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.710
 until they cease around a mere 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.840
 wait for it in trigoria but you know you are 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.610
 really out at the gate to say 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.970
 this yes this yes this yes I say 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.500
 this name but to understand that some one 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.450
 my friend has a lot 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.190
 told the work he told me you have to do the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.350
 30 percent when they go away ten 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.390
 nationals you don't have to know that at least three 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.100
 can come back with some ailments e 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.780
 an almost statistical thing that between 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.780
 the other is a coach was active and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.730
 so I trust it is certain that we hope then 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.360
 the grain is never known as a grain 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.160
 much so serious it does not seem to be the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.080
 martino 's of particularly home 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.140
 however I want it if February 6th for 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.110
 keep them monica second part of how much 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.120
 better at the expense though it is not theirs 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.820
 national but then there is then the speech 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.730
 which concerns osvaldo the osvaldo he has 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.370
 said in the national team he reiterated some 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.930
 concepts giving strength to what they are 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.360
 been of the matteo statements that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.120
 they did discuss it just went away 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 because normal fans are like but 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 there was a part that challenged me 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 intolerable the writings under the house has 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.350
 made to understand to feel this pressure 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 so what is evident in the field 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.489
 do something almost always that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.310
 civilian outside he too must take the exam 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.290
 of consciousness the hill area also because it is there 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.360
 to say second 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.000
 something that I say in some ways I have 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 bed that stated they didn't want me 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.109
 more in my opinion in some ways which I don't 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 he wanted himself more at some point 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.739
 has expressed some intemperance of 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.970
 too much and in an environment like this 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.310
 above all we are coming congresses to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.799
 how important the group is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.569
 when you have a certain character 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.000
 anit acts that out alone is not that 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.829
 I don't want too much space with you 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.379
 there is not too much space and therefore I believe that 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.269
 it was an almost natural purge and 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.939
 I think in some ways justified 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.159
 this is justifiable and just this 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.489
 he certainly defies what 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.889
 we did raise the decibels and so 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.720
 we can not even several things in the field 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.150
 we have said or done almost always the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.669
 his duty another this matteo duty 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.319
 will have to do it and hopefully can come back to 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.540
 is to take a leading role very soon 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.340
 right mattia 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.989
 we finally said calvary we are 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.379
 still the projections also said 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.329
 grace there is no default date for 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.159
 establish his return to the field 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.540
 rome needs mattia right 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.940
 now he needs Rome to return 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.250
 what was that owner 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.229
 practically of the Italian national team 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.290
 a year ago I play against England 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:03.629
 with the poverty of August, he did 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.750
 go crazy on the English defenders not 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.699
 we wait we wait for him with arms 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.620
 open on the scene of a thing on the right 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.019
 that so many things were said a year 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.449
 last but if we see the golden average e 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.310
 monstrous impressed by the presence of 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.320
 minutes played that they say made 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.389
 complete we do not talk about was the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.449
 absolute bomber and then let's face it 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.580
 Right truth was the most player 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.699
 sought after in the market of the past 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.610
 season but above all Rome has 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.860
 so much trust so much that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.550
 placed there in front he knows that of a 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.250
 really important player 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.040
 I am convinced that your title is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.480
 late ordeal is really near a 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.120
 Calvary small ordeal 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.570
 he was late but in short he was a 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.250
 there was some tension when yes 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.950
 recovers from an injury 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.420
 you know that a protocol is made that 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.340
 nor done with great seriousness 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.430
 then there is an answer that that is that 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.800
 that physical and if there is a small problem 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.770
 surely it resolves and I believe that 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.370
 now we are the last mattia mattea 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 right 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 we have it we said it will be for me 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.340
 in the area the hope of all of us 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.740
 protagonist of this season who da 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.960
 matteo the protagonist introduced himself to 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.720
 trigoria you understood from the first steps 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.510
 that has moved is unique both in the name of 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.120
 new coach is shaping this 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.490
 Normally we do not exalt the two on the gardens 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.200
 victories, however, the turnaround 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.180
 at least from that point of view it seems 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.810
 be there to watch or escape either 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.690
 I would talk 40 minutes in the sense that it is him 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.980
 the cover man and he definitely is 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.870
 It was a great technical choice 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.490
 certainly one thing happened to him 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.060
 would have given settings well 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.880
 precise and I believe I have never seen in 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.670
 ten years of all days of trigory 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.860
 a technician so good at giving his own 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.840
 hand to the team so quickly 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.760
 it never happened after a week of 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.520
 training the team did what 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.920
 he said and that's where he got it 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.130
 it would be the same as was the 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720
 demiurgo right way is in my opinion 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.150
 certainly the most correct definition e 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.620
 I must also tell you that it is true there 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.240
 we must exalt why we did it 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.970
 in recent years we have remained a while 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.550
 however, taking too much too is it 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.890
 this time the low tones 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.129
 they serve but I believe it can be 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.020
 really good time to see a 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:31.779
 top level coach a 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.479
 great manager of the group is one who 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.819
 I think it looks like stick and carrot in 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.800
 excellent way and it's a great one 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.969
 I am practically certain of the coach 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.279
 and hopefully good 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:45.069
 word of matteo vespasiani appointment 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:48.399
 with you when we see him when he scores 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.529
 Rome is first and foremost on a daily basis 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:52.449
 they kiss word of crazy husband talks about 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.429
 sleeve enough with this hard he says 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.469
 which they are going to explain but it is always 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:58.599
 early evening one of us will tell him 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:01.330
 patacca 24 is all for the second 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.929
 episode from to March thanks to the weapon 24 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.929
 next one
