peeling<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.720> cleanup<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.789> leftovers

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
peeling and the cleanup of the leftovers

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:13.740 
peeling and the cleanup of the leftovers
will<00:02:01.820> be<00:02:02.060> easier<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:04.070> we<00:02:04.160> go

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.200 

and<00:02:14.750> that's<00:02:15.170> all<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.090> we'll<00:02:17.090> go

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
and that's all there is to that we'll go

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.020

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
this is gonna be code three on this side
