is to do the so called in-betweens which
is<00:03:38.910> basically<00:03:39.300> drawing<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.080> frames<00:03:40.350> in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
is basically drawing the frames in

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.190 
is basically drawing the frames in
between<00:03:41.030> two<00:03:42.030> other<00:03:42.180> frames<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.810> create<00:03:42.960> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
between two other frames to create the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800 
between two other frames to create the
movement<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.950> animation<00:03:44.460> now<00:03:45.210> having

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
movement of the animation now having

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.300 
movement of the animation now having
ideas<00:03:46.020> isn't<00:03:46.650> hard

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
ideas isn't hard

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.460 
ideas isn't hard
the<00:03:47.460> real<00:03:47.700> problem<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.420> grabbing<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.080> idea

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
the real problem is grabbing that idea

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.830 
the real problem is grabbing that idea
and<00:03:49.740> making<00:03:50.130> something<00:03:50.520> good<00:03:50.850> out<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.300> like

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and making something good out of it like

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.170 
and making something good out of it like
writing<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.440> good<00:03:52.560> scripts<00:03:53.100> or<00:03:53.280> making<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> nice

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
writing a good scripts or making a nice

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.750 
writing a good scripts or making a nice
animation<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.170> script<00:03:55.590> that's<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.580> hard

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
animation of that script that's the hard
