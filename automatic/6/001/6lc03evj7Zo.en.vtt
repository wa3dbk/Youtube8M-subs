Destroy with 61 I'm not a hundred

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.770 
Destroy with 61 I'm not a hundred
percent<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> might<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> 62<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.780> yeah

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
percent on that it might be 62 but yeah

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049

I'm<00:00:40.320> complexity<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.550> solidified

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I'm complexity pretty much solidified

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'm complexity pretty much solidified
the<00:00:42.180> fact<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:43.820> they<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.750> black

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the fact that they they are just black

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
the fact that they they are just black
ops<00:00:46.649> 2<00:00:47.480> aficionados<00:00:48.480> still<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.680> there's<00:00:50.489> no

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ops 2 aficionados still think there's no

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.939 
ops 2 aficionados still think there's no
team<00:00:51.149> man<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:52.559> play<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:53.870> but

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
team man that can play that well but

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.200 
team man that can play that well but
when<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.520> well<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> mean<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
when I say play that well I mean just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
when I say play that well I mean just
play<00:00:57.570> black<00:00:57.809> ops<00:00:57.960> 2<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> mean

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
play black ops 2 that well I mean

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.400 
play black ops 2 that well I mean
they've<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.039> got<00:00:59.250> they've<00:00:59.879> got<00:00:59.910> this

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
they've just got they've got this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.119 
they've just got they've got this
interesting<00:01:01.410> chemistry<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
interesting chemistry in this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.939 
interesting chemistry in this

in<00:01:33.000> ghosts<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.570> mean<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:34.770> wondering<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.280> they

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
in ghosts I mean I'm wondering if they

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
in ghosts I mean I'm wondering if they
don't<00:01:35.640> win<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> first<00:01:36.119> couple<00:01:36.299> tournaments

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
don't win the first couple tournaments

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
don't win the first couple tournaments
if<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> roster<00:01:37.829> change<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
if they will make a roster change you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.330 
if they will make a roster change you
know<00:01:38.520> trying<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> build<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> roster<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.500> cod

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
know trying to build a roster for cod

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
know trying to build a roster for cod
ghosts<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.970> we'll<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.290> mean

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
ghosts but we'll have to see i mean

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
ghosts but we'll have to see i mean
these<00:01:44.640> guys<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.049> quite<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
these guys have they have quite the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.859 
these guys have they have quite the
chemistry<00:01:46.829> together<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> it'll<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.509> very

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
chemistry together and it'll be very

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
chemistry together and it'll be very
very<00:01:49.110> interesting<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:49.979> they<00:01:50.130> fare
