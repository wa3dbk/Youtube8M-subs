00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
first block of gel on this side I've got

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.179 
first block of gel on this side I've got
a<00:00:30.060> couple<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.570> balloons<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.830> filled

they do in this gelatin kind of thinking

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.869 
they do in this gelatin kind of thinking
that<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.030> looks<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.670> see<00:00:56.670> one

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
has the little polymer tip on the end of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.969 
has the little polymer tip on the end of
it<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> neat

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it kind of neat

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.120 
it kind of neat
55<00:01:05.850> grains<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:09.290> let<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.470> say<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> there

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
55 grains they let they say that there

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
55 grains they let they say that there
are<00:01:11.280> three<00:01:12.030> hundred<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> twenty<00:01:13.549> three

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
are three hundred and twenty three

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
are three hundred and twenty three
thousand<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.060> hundred<00:01:15.090> forty<00:01:15.540> feet<00:01:15.750> per

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
thousand two hundred forty feet per

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.990 
thousand two hundred forty feet per
second<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:18.360> blocks<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> gel

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
second so I have the two blocks of gel

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.100 
second so I have the two blocks of gel
I'm<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> leave<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
I'm going to leave these right in the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.920 
I'm going to leave these right in the
frame<00:01:22.490> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> neat<00:01:24.119> looking<00:01:24.479> frame

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
frame kind of a neat looking frame

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.499 
frame kind of a neat looking frame
and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.070> end<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> jug<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and then at the very end I put a jug of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
and then at the very end I put a jug of
water<00:01:27.829> just<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.930> stop<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> continues<00:01:32.189> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
water just to stop it if it continues on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
water just to stop it if it continues on
and<00:01:32.810> zoom<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.290> bit<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and zoom out a little bit so we get the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
and zoom out a little bit so we get the
whole<00:01:37.710> thing<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> shop<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.320> we

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
whole thing in the shop and so here we

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
whole thing in the shop and so here we
go<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:45.140> load<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.640> ar-15<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
go we're going to load up the ar-15 and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.899 
go we're going to load up the ar-15 and
take<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:48.960> test<00:01:49.229> shot<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.700> gel

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
take one test shot and see if the gel

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.069 
take one test shot and see if the gel
even<00:01:51.149> stops<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:52.159> okay<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
even stops it or not okay so we have the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.999 
even stops it or not okay so we have the
zombie<00:01:55.740> max<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.369> 223<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> 18-inch

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
zombie max in 223 I have a 18-inch

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.080 
zombie max in 223 I have a 18-inch
barrel<00:01:59.810> ar-15<00:02:01.070> into<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.399> blocks<00:02:02.790> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
barrel ar-15 into two blocks of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870 
barrel ar-15 into two blocks of
ballistics<00:02:03.600> gelatin<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
ballistics gelatin and if I can get it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.399 
ballistics gelatin and if I can get it
level<00:02:06.240> enough<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.810> should<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.049> able<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> stay

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
level enough we should be able to stay

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:20.020 
level enough we should be able to stay
in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> blocks<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:10.099> redo<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030

anywhere<00:03:03.570> here<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:03.990> I'm<00:03:04.050> not<00:03:04.200> sure<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:04.620> went

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
anywhere here so I'm not sure what went

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.510 
anywhere here so I'm not sure what went
on<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.960> see<00:03:06.960> fragments<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.740> light<00:03:07.980> all<00:03:08.160> over<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
on I see fragments of light all over the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.000

place

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.430

this<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.160> bounced<00:03:11.640> up<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> air<00:03:12.210> do<00:03:13.200> some

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
this is bounced up in the air do some

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.540 
this is bounced up in the air do some
more<00:03:13.800> examining<00:03:15.260> I've<00:03:16.260> got<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:16.860> entrance<00:03:17.340> on

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
more examining I've got no entrance on

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.820 
more examining I've got no entrance on
the<00:03:17.640> second<00:03:18.090> piece<00:03:18.300> of<00:03:18.480> gel<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> really<00:03:22.620> do

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
the second piece of gel so I really do

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.100 
the second piece of gel so I really do
not<00:03:22.860> know<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.370> happened<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.240> had<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.660> perfect

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
not know what happened I had a perfect

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.290 
not know what happened I had a perfect
trajectory<00:03:25.260> through<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.300> perfectly

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
trajectory through here perfectly

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.940 
trajectory through here perfectly
straight<00:03:28.220> lots<00:03:29.220> energy<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.410> see<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
straight lots energy you can see that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.430 
straight lots energy you can see that
one<00:03:32.730> channel<00:03:33.090> going<00:03:33.780> through<00:03:33.990> there<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> can

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
one channel going through there you can

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.460 
one channel going through there you can
see<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.740> big<00:03:35.040> expanse<00:03:35.490> here<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:37.020> can<00:03:37.230> fit

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
see this big expanse here and I can fit

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.370 
see this big expanse here and I can fit
my<00:03:37.650> whole<00:03:37.800> my<00:03:38.010> finger<00:03:38.340> right<00:03:38.520> through<00:03:38.550> here

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
my whole my finger right through here

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.840 
my whole my finger right through here
that's<00:03:40.380> telling<00:03:40.830> me<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.310> bullet<00:03:41.490> must

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that's telling me that that bullet must

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.530 
that's telling me that that bullet must
be<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.420> other<00:03:42.630> balloon<00:03:44.390> because<00:03:45.390> it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
be in this other balloon because it

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.910 
be in this other balloon because it
doesn't<00:03:45.870> go<00:03:45.990> past<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.530> there's<00:03:46.800> like<00:03:46.860> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
doesn't go past there there's like a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.730 
doesn't go past there there's like a
little<00:03:47.130> pinhole<00:03:47.670> there<00:03:48.200> let's<00:03:49.200> take<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> look

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
little pinhole there let's take a look

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.020 
little pinhole there let's take a look
this<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.670> frame<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.640> we<00:03:56.790> caught

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
this in frame and it is so we caught

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.540 
this in frame and it is so we caught
that<00:03:57.300> bullet<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.080> second<00:03:58.530> balloon<00:04:01.490> see<00:04:02.490> if

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
that bullet in the second balloon see if

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.250 
that bullet in the second balloon see if
I<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:02.850> stretch<00:04:03.270> this<00:04:03.450> open<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.900> get<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.140> out

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
I can stretch this open and get it out

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.850 
I can stretch this open and get it out
now<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.250> pretty<00:04:05.520> cool<00:04:05.850> because<00:04:06.709> those<00:04:07.709> are

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
now that's pretty cool because those are

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.730 
now that's pretty cool because those are
supposed<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.250> expand<00:04:08.700> rapidly<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.570> not<00:04:10.530> you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
supposed to expand rapidly and not you

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.290 
supposed to expand rapidly and not you
know<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.130> mean<00:04:11.459> they're<00:04:11.580> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.820> penetrate

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
know I mean they're going to penetrate

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.760 
know I mean they're going to penetrate
deep<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.750> they're<00:04:12.900> not<00:04:12.990> supposed<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.380> over

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
deep but they're not supposed to over

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.490 
deep but they're not supposed to over
penetrate<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:16.220> soft<00:04:17.220> tissue<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:19.320> was

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
penetrate on soft tissue and I was

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.050 
penetrate on soft tissue and I was
beginning<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.100> beginning<00:04:20.220> thinking<00:04:20.880> that

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
beginning in the beginning thinking that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.030 
beginning in the beginning thinking that
that<00:04:21.180> thing<00:04:21.479> just<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.960> know<00:04:22.109> went<00:04:22.890> right

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
that thing just you know went right

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.330 
that thing just you know went right
through<00:04:23.070> everything<00:04:23.610> but<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.060> didn't

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
through everything but it didn't

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.610 
through everything but it didn't
so<00:04:26.340> there's<00:04:26.580> our<00:04:26.760> bullet<00:04:27.150> pieces<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.990> that

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
so there's our bullet pieces and that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.710 
so there's our bullet pieces and that
tells<00:04:28.890> me<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.580> actually<00:04:29.760> try<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.540> in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
tells me that I can actually try that in

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.380 
tells me that I can actually try that in
this<00:04:31.440> solid<00:04:31.950> piece<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.160> gel<00:04:32.670> now<00:04:33.140> without<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
this solid piece of gel now without the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.270 
this solid piece of gel now without the
without<00:04:36.390> all<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.930> extra<00:04:36.960> pieces<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.950> balloon

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
without all the extra pieces of balloon

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.420 
without all the extra pieces of balloon
involved<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:38.970> see<00:04:39.120> what<00:04:39.270> we<00:04:39.390> can<00:04:39.540> get<00:04:39.660> for<00:04:39.900> an

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
involved and see what we can get for an

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.170 
involved and see what we can get for an
expansion<00:04:41.430> in<00:04:41.790> just<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:43.130> one<00:04:44.130> solid<00:04:44.700> piece<00:04:44.730> of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
expansion in just a one solid piece of

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.180 
expansion in just a one solid piece of
gel<00:04:45.750> instead<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.290> having<00:04:46.770> those<00:04:46.860> air<00:04:47.160> pockets

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
gel instead of having those air pockets

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.730 
gel instead of having those air pockets
and<00:04:47.910> water<00:04:48.120> pockets<00:04:48.660> in<00:04:48.810> there<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.590> we're

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
and water pockets in there so we're

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.040 
and water pockets in there so we're
going<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.920> do<00:04:50.040> another<00:04:50.280> test<00:04:50.580> fire<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.840> just

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
going to do another test fire and I just

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.800 
going to do another test fire and I just
got<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.290> take<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.100> pause<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.730> set<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:54.060> some<00:04:54.270> some

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
got to take a pause to set up some some

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.620 
got to take a pause to set up some some
backstops<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.770> we'll<00:04:55.890> have<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.390> okay<00:04:57.390> have<00:04:57.600> a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
backstops and we'll have you okay have a

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.840 
backstops and we'll have you okay have a
same<00:04:58.230> setup<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.830> had<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.010> minute<00:04:59.310> ago<00:04:59.370> just

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
same setup that I had a minute ago just

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.750 
same setup that I had a minute ago just
replace<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.450> backstop<00:05:01.200> this<00:05:01.860> first<00:05:02.460> block<00:05:02.730> of

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
replace the backstop this first block of

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.560 
replace the backstop this first block of
gelatin<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:04.100> just<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.190> solid<00:05:05.610> block<00:05:05.820> the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
gelatin here is just a solid block the

gelatin here is just a solid block the
other<00:05:06.720> one<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.110> know<00:05:07.140> had<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:08.040> balloons

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
other one you know had the the balloons

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.800 
other one you know had the the balloons
in<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.730> which<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:09.000> kind<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.240> cool<00:05:09.450> for<00:05:09.690> some

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
in it which is kind of cool for some

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.600

pistol<00:05:10.200> testing<00:05:10.650> but<00:05:10.800> for<00:05:11.040> these<00:05:11.160> rifle

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
pistol testing but for these rifle

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.500 
pistol testing but for these rifle
rounds<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:12.300> um<00:05:13.970> gives<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.180> less

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
rounds it just um gives it less

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.480 
rounds it just um gives it less
resistance<00:05:16.140> when<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.350> hits<00:05:16.500> them<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.010> again

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
resistance when it hits them so again

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.830 
resistance when it hits them so again
the<00:05:17.930> Hornady<00:05:18.930> zombie<00:05:19.860> max<00:05:20.100> in<00:05:20.370> 223<00:05:21.090> I'm<00:05:21.690> going

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
the Hornady zombie max in 223 I'm going

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.250 
the Hornady zombie max in 223 I'm going
to<00:05:21.930> fire<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.169> into<00:05:22.350> this<00:05:22.590> block<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:24.780> see<00:05:25.080> if<00:05:25.140> we

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
to fire it into this block and see if we

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.320 
to fire it into this block and see if we
get<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.440> little<00:05:25.680> better<00:05:25.980> result<00:05:26.460> than<00:05:26.700> we<00:05:27.180> did

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
get a little better result than we did

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.360 
get a little better result than we did
before

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
before

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.400 
before
result<00:05:29.370> before<00:05:29.520> was<00:05:29.850> pretty<00:05:30.120> neat<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:33.410> also

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
result before was pretty neat but also

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.830 
result before was pretty neat but also
didn't<00:05:35.070> really<00:05:35.160> give<00:05:35.430> us<00:05:35.460> much<00:05:35.790> information

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
didn't really give us much information

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.120 
didn't really give us much information
because<00:05:36.840> we<00:05:37.050> didn't<00:05:37.260> catch<00:05:37.470> anything<00:05:37.770> really

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
because we didn't catch anything really

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.790 
because we didn't catch anything really
about<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.090> bullet<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:39.479> the<00:05:39.540> balloon<00:05:39.810> all<00:05:40.140> in

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
about that bullet in the balloon all in

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.440 
about that bullet in the balloon all in
pieces<00:05:41.100> so<00:05:42.290> gonna<00:05:43.290> put<00:05:43.470> one<00:05:43.620> in<00:05:43.740> here<00:05:43.919> and

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
pieces so gonna put one in here and

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.070 
pieces so gonna put one in here and
we're<00:05:45.450> go<00:05:45.750> ahead<00:05:46.430> line<00:05:47.430> up<00:05:47.610> on<00:05:47.790> this<00:05:48.080> thing

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
we're go ahead line up on this thing

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.460 
we're go ahead line up on this thing
here<00:05:49.260> get<00:05:49.500> as<00:05:49.590> level<00:05:49.950> as<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.160> can<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:51.600> here<00:05:52.320> we

here get as level as I can and here we

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.409 
here get as level as I can and here we
go

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.530 

okay<00:05:57.419> let's<00:05:57.720> see<00:05:57.900> what<00:05:58.020> we<00:05:58.110> got<00:05:58.260> now<00:05:59.540> gonna

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
okay let's see what we got now gonna

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.080 
okay let's see what we got now gonna
need<00:06:00.720> some<00:06:00.930> bigger<00:06:01.169> blocks<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:02.070> gel<00:06:02.430> is<00:06:02.610> what

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
need some bigger blocks of gel is what

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.060 
need some bigger blocks of gel is what
the<00:06:03.180> issue<00:06:03.300> is<00:06:03.510> going<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.690> be<00:06:03.750> there's<00:06:04.740> just

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
the issue is going to be there's just

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:14.210 
the issue is going to be there's just
too<00:06:05.190> much<00:06:05.370> energy<00:06:05.910> there<00:06:07.040> for<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:09.660> 223<00:06:10.370> to<00:06:13.220> be

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
too much energy there for the 223 to be

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.170 
too much energy there for the 223 to be
captured<00:06:15.320> here's<00:06:16.320> our<00:06:16.500> entry<00:06:16.680> a<00:06:17.190> little<00:06:18.090> bit

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
captured here's our entry a little bit

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.060 
captured here's our entry a little bit
high<00:06:18.300> took<00:06:18.600> a<00:06:18.690> huge<00:06:18.900> chunk<00:06:19.290> out<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.770> it<00:06:19.919> and

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
high took a huge chunk out of it and

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.180 
high took a huge chunk out of it and
then<00:06:20.850> as<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.690> goes<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:22.050> here<00:06:22.350> see<00:06:22.770> like<00:06:22.890> tears

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
then as it goes in here see like tears

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.680 
then as it goes in here see like tears
apart<00:06:23.580> because<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.150> can<00:06:25.080> see<00:06:25.410> a<00:06:26.240> deformation<00:06:27.240> on

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
apart because I can see a deformation on

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.600 
apart because I can see a deformation on
the<00:06:27.720> top<00:06:28.080> it<00:06:28.380> looks<00:06:28.560> like<00:06:28.740> almost<00:06:29.010> maybe<00:06:29.460> it

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
the top it looks like almost maybe it

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.770 
the top it looks like almost maybe it
came<00:06:29.820> out<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.210> top<00:06:31.130> and<00:06:32.510> that's<00:06:33.510> what<00:06:33.690> I'm

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
came out the top and that's what I'm

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.780 
came out the top and that's what I'm
seeing<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.740> went<00:06:34.979> in<00:06:35.099> here

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
seeing it went in here

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.240 
seeing it went in here
and<00:06:35.880> then<00:06:36.360> it<00:06:36.590> detoured<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.740> came<00:06:38.010> right<00:06:38.220> off

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
and then it detoured and came right off

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.670 
and then it detoured and came right off
the<00:06:38.460> top<00:06:38.700> of<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:39.090> gelatin<00:06:39.840> block<00:06:40.550> so<00:06:41.690> again<00:06:42.690> we

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
the top of the gelatin block so again we

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.410 
the top of the gelatin block so again we
didn't<00:06:43.980> capture<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.550> just<00:06:44.820> flew<00:06:45.090> out<00:06:45.240> the

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
didn't capture that just flew out the

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.010 
didn't capture that just flew out the
top<00:06:45.660> and<00:06:46.910> don't<00:06:47.910> know<00:06:48.030> where<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.300> went<00:06:48.390> so

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
top and don't know where it went so

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.360 
top and don't know where it went so
we're<00:06:49.260> going<00:06:49.350> to<00:06:49.440> need<00:06:49.500> some<00:06:49.710> bigger<00:06:49.980> blocks

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
we're going to need some bigger blocks

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.260 
we're going to need some bigger blocks
to<00:06:50.820> test<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:51.510> 223<00:06:51.990> on<00:06:52.410> and<00:06:52.910> I'm<00:06:53.910> not<00:06:53.970> really

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
to test the 223 on and I'm not really

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.330 
to test the 223 on and I'm not really
counting<00:06:54.690> on<00:06:54.720> getting<00:06:54.900> any<00:06:55.140> real<00:06:55.410> good<00:06:55.710> I<00:06:55.950> mean

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
counting on getting any real good I mean

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.030 
counting on getting any real good I mean
that's<00:06:56.550> just<00:06:56.640> vicious<00:06:57.210> tearing<00:06:57.740> that's<00:06:58.740> just

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
that's just vicious tearing that's just

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.520 
that's just vicious tearing that's just
huge<00:06:59.460> and<00:06:59.910> once<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.360> ledges<00:07:00.780> disintegrated

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
huge and once the ledges disintegrated

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.200 
huge and once the ledges disintegrated
entirely<00:07:01.920> I<00:07:02.100> mean<00:07:02.310> you<00:07:02.640> can<00:07:02.790> see<00:07:02.940> there's<00:07:03.150> a

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
entirely I mean you can see there's a

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.420 
entirely I mean you can see there's a
little<00:07:03.450> piece<00:07:03.600> here<00:07:04.140> teeny<00:07:04.770> teeny<00:07:05.100> piece

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
little piece here teeny teeny piece

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.060 
little piece here teeny teeny piece
there's<00:07:05.790> teeny<00:07:06.600> pieces<00:07:06.990> in<00:07:07.320> here<00:07:07.590> like<00:07:07.770> almost

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
there's teeny pieces in here like almost

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:16.000 
there's teeny pieces in here like almost
dust<00:07:10.070> and<00:07:11.540> I'm<00:07:12.540> not<00:07:12.900> finding<00:07:13.640> any<00:07:14.640> significant

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
dust and I'm not finding any significant

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.350 
dust and I'm not finding any significant
bullet<00:07:17.010> but<00:07:17.160> you<00:07:17.280> can<00:07:17.430> certainly<00:07:17.820> see<00:07:18.330> the

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
bullet but you can certainly see the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.010 
bullet but you can certainly see the
trauma<00:07:19.070> there's<00:07:20.070> some<00:07:20.400> of<00:07:20.550> the<00:07:20.730> tip<00:07:21.180> some<00:07:21.990> of

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
trauma there's some of the tip some of

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.820 
trauma there's some of the tip some of
that<00:07:22.200> polymer<00:07:23.330> in<00:07:24.330> the<00:07:24.720> first<00:07:24.990> portion<00:07:25.290> of<00:07:25.680> it

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
that polymer in the first portion of it

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.900 
that polymer in the first portion of it
and<00:07:26.990> at<00:07:27.990> some<00:07:28.260> point<00:07:28.590> it<00:07:29.370> looked<00:07:29.610> to<00:07:29.790> me<00:07:29.880> like

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
and at some point it looked to me like

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.150 
and at some point it looked to me like
it<00:07:30.090> came<00:07:30.660> out<00:07:30.810> the<00:07:30.960> top<00:07:31.170> of<00:07:31.350> that<00:07:31.440> block<00:07:32.180> which

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 
it came out the top of that block which

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.080 
it came out the top of that block which
which<00:07:35.160> makes<00:07:35.400> sense<00:07:35.610> it<00:07:35.820> could<00:07:35.910> have<00:07:36.030> been

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
which makes sense it could have been

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.940 
which makes sense it could have been
flying<00:07:36.420> you<00:07:36.690> know<00:07:36.810> so<00:07:37.050> fast<00:07:37.380> that<00:07:37.590> it<00:07:37.740> just

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
flying you know so fast that it just

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.530 
flying you know so fast that it just
kind<00:07:38.190> of<00:07:38.250> like<00:07:38.400> something<00:07:38.970> skipping<00:07:39.390> off<00:07:39.510> a

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 
kind of like something skipping off a

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.270 
kind of like something skipping off a
water<00:07:39.900> sort<00:07:40.320> of<00:07:40.410> it's<00:07:40.560> going<00:07:40.740> and<00:07:41.010> going<00:07:41.220> and

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 
water sort of it's going and going and

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.550 
water sort of it's going and going and
then<00:07:41.400> it<00:07:41.490> just<00:07:41.700> gets<00:07:42.480> to<00:07:42.750> the<00:07:42.900> right<00:07:43.050> speed<00:07:43.380> and

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 
then it just gets to the right speed and

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.610 
then it just gets to the right speed and
decides<00:07:43.920> to<00:07:44.150> change<00:07:45.150> direction<00:07:45.600> I'm<00:07:45.990> kind<00:07:46.560> of

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 
decides to change direction I'm kind of

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.140 
decides to change direction I'm kind of
neat

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150 
neat

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.170 
neat
anyway<00:07:48.150> that's<00:07:48.350> 223<00:07:49.350> zombie<00:07:50.310> max<00:07:50.580> into

anyway that's 223 zombie max into

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.660 
anyway that's 223 zombie max into
ballistics<00:07:51.480> gelatin<00:07:52.020> and<00:07:52.560> we'll<00:07:53.280> have<00:07:53.400> to<00:07:53.550> get

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:53.670 
ballistics gelatin and we'll have to get

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.410 
ballistics gelatin and we'll have to get
some<00:07:53.730> bigger<00:07:54.180> blocks<00:07:54.630> of<00:07:54.900> gelatin
