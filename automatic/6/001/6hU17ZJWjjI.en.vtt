enjoyed it feeding to this curiosity
idea<00:04:34.419> is<00:04:34.690> what<00:04:35.849> escuela<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:37.150> all<00:04:37.330> about<00:04:37.599> this

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
idea is what escuela is all about this

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.589 
idea is what escuela is all about this
idea<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.530> intrinsic<00:04:39.130> motivation<00:04:39.340> where<00:04:40.180> you

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
idea of intrinsic motivation where you

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.180 
idea of intrinsic motivation where you
do<00:04:40.990> something<00:04:41.320> because<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.620> want<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.949> not

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
do something because you want to not

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.710 
do something because you want to not
because<00:04:42.400> there's<00:04:42.729> an<00:04:42.820> exterior<00:04:43.030> motive<00:04:43.509> I

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
because there's an exterior motive I

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.749 
because there's an exterior motive I
came<00:04:44.050> back<00:04:44.199> after<00:04:44.440> lessons<00:04:44.979> wanting<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.639> know

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
came back after lessons wanting to know

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.060 
came back after lessons wanting to know
more<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.509> when<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.020> finish<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.320> good<00:04:47.560> book<00:04:47.740> it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
more like when you finish a good book it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.529 
more like when you finish a good book it
doesn't<00:04:48.520> end<00:04:48.699> there's<00:04:48.970> another<00:04:49.180> one<00:04:49.389> coming

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
doesn't end there's another one coming

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.740 
doesn't end there's another one coming
you<00:04:50.380> want<00:04:51.039> to<00:04:51.220> know<00:04:51.310> what<00:04:51.460> happens<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.030> I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
you want to know what happens and I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.020 
you want to know what happens and I
think<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:53.080> escuela<00:04:53.380> definitely<00:04:54.250> taught<00:04:55.000> me

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
think that escuela definitely taught me

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.340 
think that escuela definitely taught me
how<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.680> want<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:57.250> learn

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.290 

Montessori<00:05:02.350> education<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.610> really<00:05:04.000> a

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
Montessori education is is really a

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.800 
Montessori education is is really a
preparation<00:05:05.140> for<00:05:05.350> life<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.360> like<00:05:07.660> to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
preparation for life and so I like to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.720 
preparation for life and so I like to
think<00:05:08.020> about<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.410> as<00:05:08.560> preparing<00:05:09.100> children<00:05:09.340> for

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
think about it as preparing children for

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.360 
think about it as preparing children for
what<00:05:09.850> they<00:05:10.000> would<00:05:10.150> encounter<00:05:10.600> in<00:05:10.930> society<00:05:11.710> so

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
what they would encounter in society so

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.940 
what they would encounter in society so
the<00:05:12.460> Montessori<00:05:12.940> model<00:05:13.420> is<00:05:13.630> about<00:05:14.080> working<00:05:14.680> in

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
the Montessori model is about working in

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.250 
the Montessori model is about working in
groups<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.670> learning<00:05:16.180> from<00:05:16.480> each<00:05:16.630> other<00:05:16.870> and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
groups and learning from each other and

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.430 
groups and learning from each other and
not<00:05:17.830> just<00:05:17.860> learning<00:05:18.550> from<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.480> teacher<00:05:19.720> but

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
not just learning from the teacher but

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.380 
not just learning from the teacher but
learning<00:05:20.620> from<00:05:20.740> your<00:05:21.040> own<00:05:21.220> exploration<00:05:22.120> and

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
learning from your own exploration and

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.470 
learning from your own exploration and
your<00:05:22.600> own<00:05:22.720> experience<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:24.330> learning<00:05:25.330> through

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
your own experience and learning through

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480 
your own experience and learning through
doing<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.470> that's<00:05:26.710> why<00:05:26.890> we<00:05:27.100> have<00:05:27.220> so<00:05:27.400> many

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
doing so that's why we have so many

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.310 
doing so that's why we have so many
materials<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.330> our<00:05:28.420> classroom<00:05:29.020> where<00:05:29.230> the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
materials in our classroom where the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.400 
materials in our classroom where the
children<00:05:29.740> are<00:05:29.860> working<00:05:30.630> kind<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.780> hands-on

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
children are working kind of a hands-on

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.620 
children are working kind of a hands-on
approach<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:33.340> they're<00:05:33.970> they're<00:05:34.420> being

they're<00:05:35.080> able<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.440> see<00:05:35.920> concepts<00:05:36.760> not<00:05:37.750> just

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
they're able to see concepts not just

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.620 
they're able to see concepts not just
