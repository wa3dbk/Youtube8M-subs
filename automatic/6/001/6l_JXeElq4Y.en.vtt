00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.900
 5 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.190
 Clash open to single play Attack 40th 7th electric shock 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.790
 I am assuming that the town is based on three minutes and the min level fo 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.630
 We've got 180 dogs. 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.150
 This weekend, the Hillier 12 Giant Wizard thirteen of what Becker 4 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.590
 And the rest is filled in and gave him a barbarian 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.489
 If you have a little firepower, you can reduce the number of barbarians and enjoy your mouse 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.300
 wish 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:38.380
 And before I get into it, first of all , 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.620
 I said I'd be the last map that goes to seven criteria 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.500
 Because when Mr. Siu was first launched 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.890
 I'm in Town 2 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.440
 The oval was a 3 geared toward the single-player because the latter more difficult 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.460
 The design is standing in a 3 hole town hall 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.970
 So this map tells the bushes that the town is a combination of a 3 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.410
 It would be easier for you to attack on a 50-level five. 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.190
 First we'll show you how to get to Seven's unit combination 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.880
 It is. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.479
 Later, if you want to request a unit upgrade after finishing 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.460
 If so, I will show you one more o 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.950
 Once you show the map, you can find the ellipses around the double 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.400
 A bomb hidden tracks are itguyo 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 Like the name of the map , five electric towers are hidden around the center town. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 And the oval to add a dog dojeongi tap outside the rice on the outside of double-walled week 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.750
 It's hidden. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.250
 When we attack, we will not go to the entrance at the top. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.120
 When you enter 2% of the troops and distributed much where walls because the thermal cycles 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 I will try to get through by pushing and pushing. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.110
 First , come to the voice on the side of the cannon. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.220
 After you have put two giant two giant , you can go straight to those two of the month 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.220
 I'll pierce the wall. 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:00.079
 Here unprotected split poke dog 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.319
 Divide the pastor and inject it , 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:07.340
 Keep the rest of the assaults under attack . 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.929
 And after you put the healer, you can shoot directly with bulb raft marie 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.879
 He helps you. 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.950
 What does this sound Becker walls are down-to-air units helped me button 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:20.060
 Lee Yung-dug itgetne'm denying political 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.920
 Let me see the barbarians left here and only I left . 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.220
 And I'm also a healer to enter the inside of the die doing this geureongeol 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.840
 One year in the performance, I almost see the consumption 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.019
 The giant gives the guard and the wizard's firepower makes the rest of the buildings fast 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.519
 This is a great thing to do 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:45.210
 Keep the number of mice to look at it, not to drink the Legislature reduce 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.200
 Click on the system, leaving the Wizard allows you to easily clear 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.200
 Ah 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 222 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.430
 Thank you. See you next time.
