think<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.570> club<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.140> better<00:00:55.670> than<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.120> one

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
think this club is better than the one

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
think this club is better than the one
he<00:00:57.420> has<00:00:57.800> I'm<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.129> sure<00:00:59.600> what<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> like

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
he has I'm not really sure what it like

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.109 
he has I'm not really sure what it like
why<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.280> feels<00:01:02.579> better<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.870> um<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:05.119> think

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
why this one feels better but um I think

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
why this one feels better but um I think
it<00:01:06.390> might<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it might be because of the this is the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
it might be because of the this is the
black<00:01:08.610> leather<00:01:09.140> obviously<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:10.979> friend

the<00:02:06.030> web<00:02:06.530> which<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.829> mean<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> web<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> main

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the web which I mean the web is the main

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.890 
the web which I mean the web is the main
point<00:02:10.590> where<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> glove<00:02:11.160> closes<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.569> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
point where the glove closes so if

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
point where the glove closes so if
there's<00:02:13.080> tons<00:02:13.440> of

there's tons of

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190 
there's tons of
in<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.460> gonna<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.840> hard<00:02:15.960> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
in there is gonna be really hard to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.660 
in there is gonna be really hard to
close<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.730> has<00:02:20.930> grace<00:02:21.930> split<00:02:22.350> welting<00:02:22.770> which<00:02:23.550> i

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
close it has grace split welting which i

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.140 
close it has grace split welting which i
think<00:02:23.730> looks<00:02:23.940> great<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.230> glove<00:02:26.150> it

so<00:04:32.400> here's<00:04:32.870> traditional<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.180> going

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
so here's traditional this is going

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.390 
so here's traditional this is going
Thunder<00:04:36.720> ring<00:04:36.960> there's<00:04:37.710> basically<00:04:38.070> how<00:04:38.250> it's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
Thunder ring there's basically how it's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.670 
Thunder ring there's basically how it's
came<00:04:39.210> broken<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:40.970> almost<00:04:41.970> all<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.300> way

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
came broken in almost all the way

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.320 
came broken in almost all the way
this<00:04:44.040> isn't<00:04:44.370> broken<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.790> all<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.000> way<00:04:45.120> either

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
this isn't broken in all the way either

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.190 
this isn't broken in all the way either
so<00:04:45.720> it'll<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.590> deeper<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.280> then<00:04:47.720> here's<00:04:48.720> tune

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
so it'll get deeper and then here's tune

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.190 
so it'll get deeper and then here's tune
