00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
up higher onto this bone and we're gonna

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.550 
up higher onto this bone and we're gonna
fake<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.040> illusion<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:42.170> having<00:02:43.170> one<00:02:43.379> there

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
now you're thinking this looks really

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.869 
now you're thinking this looks really
messy<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.390> ugly<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.989> for<00:02:46.500> long<00:02:46.680> I'm<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
messy and ugly not for long I'm going to

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.819 
messy and ugly not for long I'm going to
take<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> little<00:02:48.750> domed<00:02:48.989> shape

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829

take this is a little domed shape
blending<00:02:50.280> brush<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.790> I'm<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.659> gonna<00:02:51.900> take

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
blending brush and I'm just gonna take

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.670 
blending brush and I'm just gonna take
him<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.709> we're<00:02:52.829> just<00:02:52.950> gonna<00:02:53.099> smudge<00:02:53.579> this<00:02:53.879> all

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
him and we're just gonna smudge this all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.069 
him and we're just gonna smudge this all
start<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.829> along<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.220> lash<00:02:56.459> line<00:02:57.079> just

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
start in along the lash line just

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.720 
start in along the lash line just
blending<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:01.170> liner<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> looks<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.579> little

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
blending this liner so it looks a little

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.630 
blending this liner so it looks a little
smoother<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.799> then<00:03:04.799> we're<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:04.980> gonna<00:03:05.160> blend

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
smoother and then we're just gonna blend

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.759 
smoother and then we're just gonna blend
this<00:03:05.910> shape<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.599> soften<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.200> black<00:03:07.470> line

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
this shape so we soften this black line

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.740 
this shape so we soften this black line
out<00:03:08.190> onto<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.060> curve<00:03:09.359> that<00:03:09.510> we're<00:03:09.660> making

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
out onto this curve that we're making

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
out onto this curve that we're making
here<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.980> may<00:03:11.099> be<00:03:11.160> thinking<00:03:11.340> oh<00:03:11.640> gosh

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
here and you may be thinking oh gosh

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.819 
here and you may be thinking oh gosh
this<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.420> looking<00:03:12.720> really<00:03:12.870> crazy<00:03:13.349> what<00:03:13.680> is

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
this is looking really crazy what is
