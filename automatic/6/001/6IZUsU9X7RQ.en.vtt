Hello, friends! My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.000
today in this video I'll tell you
about this small tube head amp

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000
RD5H(E) Diavlo series by Randall.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is a 5-watt guitar amplifier,
designed for heavy sound.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.000
It has two 12AX7 tubes in preamp
and one 6V6 tube in power amp.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
On the front you can see
the gain knob, the volume knob,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.000
the tone knob and the 3-band
midrange switch ToneStackShift.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.000
On the rear panel here is
the speaker emulated XLR output

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000
and FX loop send and return.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's listen to the sound of this tube head.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, let's try the speaker emulation,
recorded directly from the output.
