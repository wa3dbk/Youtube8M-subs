00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
with the arrow so now that she's aware

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.250 
with the arrow so now that she's aware
of<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:16.030> everything<00:02:16.420> that's<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.990> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
of what everything that's going on I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.840 
of what everything that's going on I
think<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.920> there's<00:02:18.040> gonna<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.310> far<00:02:18.580> more<00:02:18.610> of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
think that there's gonna be far more of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.370 
think that there's gonna be far more of
a<00:02:18.910> strong<00:02:19.240> connection<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.900> bond<00:02:20.170> between

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
a strong connection and bond between

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.720 
a strong connection and bond between
those<00:02:20.650> three<00:02:20.950> oh<00:02:25.230> man<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.500> think<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.100> she<00:02:27.400> has

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
those three oh man I think that she has

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.240 
those three oh man I think that she has
just<00:02:27.760> been<00:02:28.120> through<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.780> wringer<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.560> mean

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
just been through the wringer I mean

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.660 
just been through the wringer I mean
yeah<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> think<00:02:31.270> she's<00:02:32.190> gotten<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.370> point

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
yeah I think she's gotten to a point

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.980 
yeah I think she's gotten to a point
where<00:02:34.680> her<00:02:35.680> skin<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:36.730> enough<00:02:36.990> like

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
where her skin is pretty enough like

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.380 
where her skin is pretty enough like
it's<00:02:38.800> gonna<00:02:39.010> take<00:02:39.280> her<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> while<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.760> really

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
it's gonna take her a while to really

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.130 
it's gonna take her a while to really
feel<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:42.570> mean<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.660> don't<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:43.900> she's<00:02:44.080> ever

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
feel I mean I don't think she's ever

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.330 
feel I mean I don't think she's ever
gonna<00:02:44.320> really<00:02:44.560> feel<00:02:44.770> normal<00:02:45.010> after

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
gonna really feel normal after

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.920 
gonna really feel normal after
everything<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.030> she's<00:02:46.330> gone<00:02:46.480> through<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:46.870> I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
everything that she's gone through but I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.620 
everything that she's gone through but I
think<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.440> why<00:02:48.239> her<00:02:49.239> putting<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.570> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
think that's why her putting on the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.650 
think that's why her putting on the
costume<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.410> doing<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.370> she's<00:02:51.550> doing<00:02:51.850> in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
costume and doing what she's doing in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500 
costume and doing what she's doing in
season<00:02:52.989> four<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.980> gonna<00:02:54.190> be<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.330> good

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
season four it's gonna be so very good

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.760 
season four it's gonna be so very good
for<00:02:55.690> her<00:02:55.780> because<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.050> giving<00:02:56.260> her<00:02:56.380> purpose

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
for her because it's giving her purpose

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.960 
for her because it's giving her purpose
finally<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.970> making<00:02:58.300> her<00:02:59.910> feel<00:03:00.910> like

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
