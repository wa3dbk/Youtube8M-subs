00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 the water the lizaine test garden spis 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.770
 the action are finally found for a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
 new video a new video on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.200
 bitchy boom yes the game you there 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.280
 putting the game I love and so I 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 am going to make a video on it just like 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 you views in the type we 're going 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.680
 try to beat the hammerman level 30 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 so I made a few little sons 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.789
 before but for that we will use the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.080
 warriors who are level 3 of course 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.539
 but health thanks to a small statue 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 are 449 +44 but for you can 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 see that it's quite honest well 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 even without this statue so they I have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.910
 3 6 9 12 15 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.370
 yes 15 warriors for this and for this 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 pure tce hammerman so we can see 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.780
 it's a pretty good topic 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 developed with what will put us the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.309
 more problems it's going to be the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 level rocket launcher I do not know anymore 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.030
 how much but it's going to be the spear 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 rockets that are really very who 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 really hurt the warriors 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 after the rest we do not care because 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.109
 attack one unit per unit that's going to us 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.359
 do too much damage 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.210
 that this all you will see fish in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.760
 following the video 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.439
 and so here we are going to attack himself 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.479
 normal size so 1500 where it is not 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 very dear that in addition you see the premium 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.470
 of victory and the possible bonuses they 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 are really very exciting short we 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.140
 let's get this chat and let's go 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.430
 directly on this qg of norman that we 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 let's go beating find to go see very 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 easily we thought we would launch everything 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.729
 the warrior on the leftmost part 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 possible map 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.920
 amran norman earlier and we will 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 send the flare that goes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.530
 directly destroy the report the spear 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.450
 flames that is on the left you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.040
 will see why so there of course not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 do not put mehdi teale it serves a little 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.229
 nothing if you have them level3 com - 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.850
 level 2 I think this lime of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.610
 beat m hermann but you're in a hurry 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.619
 you will see that but here we look we have 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.520
 first death down but that's because 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.290
 that he was wrong 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.869
 So here we go slowly 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.649
 does nothing just collect points for 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.890
 the following 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 and there you put a irm type 10% but 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 you put an irm to avoid you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.100
 get killed by the two sniper towers 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.390
 plus the super canon logo 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.060
 so there could park that when 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.570
 even assem pretty badly and now you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.040
 go put a screw you do one to one 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.350
 clement rocket to steer you behind 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.730
 the stuff there the city hall and you 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.070
 you put the urns directly but 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.500
 there I got a little I got a little 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.470
 file and we will say since if you 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.090
 put on the middle and bottom barrel 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 see the two rocket launchers are going to be 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 taken are same name on the same time on 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 the same there even the same do this and the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.410
 blow you see that I got very 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
 hot 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.600
 a lot of chances to win this qg 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.870
 since look there it is very very 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 wrong 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890
 I also launched a small artillery 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 in the passage and sheer curtains was destroyed it me 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.130
 remained a little bit of life of a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 of a last win but here we can 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.660
 say thank you I will give him what 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.400
 you so here is a critical moment 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.290
 poor idiot you and destroys the base 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.340
 from australia jacques at the beginning i 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.040
 did not know I had an ally but hey 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.270
 we'll see yes I stole this base from 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.350
 famous general zaho 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.390
 next time it's me going 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.100
 to visit so I did not understand 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.330
 who is this general zaouche if you the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 know tell me in the comments 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 that would be nice and we can see that we 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.620
 still wins the mass of objects 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.570
 especially the magma crystals that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.950
 are that will allow of course 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.270
 there create the masterpiece magma therefore 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.500
 it's him my first masterpiece that 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.290

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.680
 but well here is the power that it has 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.110
 been rather easy enough although I 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.430
 feel a little cracked on the lay lay or even 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.740
 level lol 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.250
 the second since I was able to 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.800
 use one and then have 6 6 7 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.630
 remaining people and so that's it 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.130
