00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all and welcome you on 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.430
 this little video program of the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.540
 live week then this time 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 yeah that's a little bit different 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.059
 usually I film with my webcam and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.670
 pago pro and not because it is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 actually loading so here is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.789
 I did not have a battery needed 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.990
 absolutely i'm going out this video 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.710
 today I want to take it out on 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 Sunday for the week and and I had 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 no time to do it after because 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 after I have the tv gr after I have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 have to go stream and so I did not have 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 the weather so good I think that's it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 would not bother too much it's a quality 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 normally rather okay it's just 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.540
 that it's not the gopro as usual 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.399
 and suddenly I have to see the headphones for 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 to have the sound I look a little foolish but 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.219
 in the end it's like I'm playing so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.620
 I was not moving if I was going to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.050
 then fout then program of the week for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 the live we will start with Sunday 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.570
 so today this Sunday, October 20th 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.489
 we will do a free antenna from 17h to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.350
 20h so there I watch my screen pray 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.460
 write all my schedule so from 17h to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.520
 20h free antenna 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.190
 then we will be 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.530
 I think on roÃ« on minecraft a little 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.670
 little split time in two I think of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.320
 anyway for free antenna this 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.400
 which is more important I think it's the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.140
 free antenna in itself it's not 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.520
 really the game I think it's the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.020
 only day of the week when the game is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 less important than what I tell 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.630
 no I think so that's free antenna this 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.979
 evening from 17h to 20h so this Sunday to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 those who see the video sunday 20 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.970
 October 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.590
 then the next live after will be 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.110
 Tuesday, October 22, so two days after 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.729
 we will do a special evening epic game 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 of evil then I let the youth a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.810
 little bit lol but here we will make a 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.899
 little bit of games you have 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.220
 surely all play where pretty much all 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.210
 some games a little bit seems too much because 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.310
 we will not type in something like 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.710
 really very very very old games 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 but kind for example ps1 games you 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 see what I mean to type a little bit 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.600
 in the retro gaming but not too much 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.009
 of euros retro it could be very 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.259
 nice to feel a little bit her 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.759
 emotions that we all had your neck or 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.229
 almost our first console between 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.420
 hands since my the ps1 was my 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.130
 first real console to me I think 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.160
 that you are pretty much the same 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.360
 less for the most part we are back 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.289
 to a little bit of games like that I 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.390
 think it can be really, really 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.009
 very fun treacherous of moving had 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.590
 move in quotes that to do 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.790
 pleasure we will be Tuesday, October 22nd of 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.260
 8 pm to midnight 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.970
 so we will play several games in the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.740

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.920
 the new season that started so 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 I hope to survive the longest 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.750
 possible in this good super hostile with 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.569
 added lots of stuff like stuff 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.840
 so much stuff from 17 hours to 20 hours 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.730
 hours 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.420

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.319

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.480
 gta 5 online and my camera has bugged me 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.740
 believe ah yes actually I believe that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.600
 I can 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:07.440
 I'm frozen on a head then 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:10.020
 wait wait for sailing pretty good ok 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.940
 that's why it's a little bit of 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.380
 shit or less camera I do not know so 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.580
 8 pm to midnight 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.770
 we will make gta 5 online then 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.410
 if he wants to go online otherwise 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.610
 will do gta 5 solo but I think lon 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.890
 there is no problem he should 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.390

 Sunday to Sunday but Sunday 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.880
 for me I do not have the planning yet 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.620
 still did you have from Sunday 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.790
 see you Saturday 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.470
 there is only Monday and Wednesday 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.310
 where the stream goes in all the others 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.280
 days of the week 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.930
 I stream so I sing a little recap 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.190
 in the description of the video for 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.560
 know exactly what time 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.230
 in any case all and stream is happening on 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.090
 the game room point tv always a so 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.560
 that's all I hope I hope 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.780
 you like having live like that 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.170
 so I know that right now the chain 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.530
 youtube is very very very very very 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.440
 very very very very very quiet for not 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.930
 say to say that there is no 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.610
 video on it simply because 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.010
 I can not find things to 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.780
 do I actually have so much finally I 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.000
 still a lot to manage 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.020
 with the game room know all live 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.870
 every day than what I have to do 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.490
 all macha and all that I have not too much 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.250
 too many ideas on my main channel 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.810
 I know that most people who 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.979
 follow me tell me every time of 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.410
 anyway you do not worry about you force 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.479
 she did not live first 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.820
 work before the chain that's what I 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.020
 do right now I'm trying to that the 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.430
 game room it's really my job 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.570
 now so the work that makes 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.130
 to eat with whom he makes pay my 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.390
 bills 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.850
 because the chain was not that 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.950
 for a very long time so so 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.300
 here I am really dedicated 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.500
 on the gaming rom but it's not for 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.090
 as far as I 'm going to leave the chain 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.650
 at all it's just that I really 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.810
 no idea did so many things 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.850
 now on minecraft that gets done is 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.000
 so few games that come out in this 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.600
 moment that it's a little calmed I know 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.710
 not too much what to do 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.080
 anyway as soon as I know what to do 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.640
 I know you're expecting a lot of 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.500
 new hardcore adventure then 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.770
 I'm trying to dig on it I want the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.479
 make 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.330
 I'm just trying to find out what 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.710
 I could do a little bit different 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.419
 than the other two that I have already done 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.430
 because if I make a simple one 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.580
 with just vanilla minecraft and that I 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.690
 do a hardcore adventure on me 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.120
 now think it's a little too much 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.169
 redo what I already did so so 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.240
 Now he'd have found a 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.800
 a trick that can add some 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.810
 more content is a little more stuff 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.450
 fun I do not know when I hear from 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.470
 look for that so do not believe that 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.760
 I abandon the chain it's not at all 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.560
 that's when I have ideas for 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.419
 do it I already have some small 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.040
 punctual video ideas like I 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.830
 was doing right now said video be I 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.080
 rage on a map be a video a little 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.550
 with a lot of editing and everything in it 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.390
 moment I'm more focused on that 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.340
 to be adventurous 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.480
 a video a day and videos yoga 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.090
 per day as we can see on others 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.110
 chains so here is so friends I you 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.310
 say I wish a good week on 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.540
 the age and rtv of the shot he wants to see no 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.250
 bad content so that's going to be cool 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.750
 and I tell you I wish you a 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.160
 Have a nice day even if in Grenoble 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.630
 today makes a shitty time there 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.210
 night when he is still better 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.850
 13 hours short it's raining there is a storm 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.100
