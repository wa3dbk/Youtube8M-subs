00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fired and the circuitry got almost

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.160 
fired and the circuitry got almost
sucked<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.430> couldn't<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.600> robot

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
sucked up and I couldn't use this robot

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.950
