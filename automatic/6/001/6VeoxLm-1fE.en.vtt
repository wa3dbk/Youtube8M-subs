okay so what a question and Facebook and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay so what a question and Facebook and
the<00:00:02.340> question<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.790> if<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:03.990> swimming<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
the question is if I can do swimming and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.179 
the question is if I can do swimming and
bed<00:00:05.970> training<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.450> alternate<00:00:07.140> dates<00:00:07.350> okay<00:00:07.950> so

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
bed training on alternate dates okay so

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.290 
bed training on alternate dates okay so
you<00:00:08.340> haven't<00:00:08.580> really<00:00:08.790> told<00:00:08.880> me<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.090> your

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300

your<00:00:13.290> overall<00:00:13.500> fitness<00:00:14.219> levels<00:00:14.759> then

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
your overall fitness levels then

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.620 
your overall fitness levels then
combining<00:00:16.350> an<00:00:16.470> anaerobic<00:00:17.190> activity<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:18.449> an

hand<00:00:39.840> weight<00:00:40.500> training<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.670> good<00:00:42.329> way

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
hand weight training is a very good way

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.310 
hand weight training is a very good way
of<00:00:42.780> enhancing<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:44.040> strength<00:00:44.760> levels<00:00:45.149> and

density that means reducing your chances
of<00:00:51.270> osteoporosis<00:00:52.020> arthritis<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
of osteoporosis arthritis and so on so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
of osteoporosis arthritis and so on so
forth<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.379> combining<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> strength<00:00:56.039> training

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
forth so combining a strength training

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
forth so combining a strength training
activity<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> cardio<00:00:57.870> activity<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
activity with a cardio activity is a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.270 
activity with a cardio activity is a
terrific<00:00:59.520> combination<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.840> enhance<00:01:01.410> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
terrific combination to enhance your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.929 
terrific combination to enhance your
overall<00:01:02.899> fitness<00:01:03.899> levels<00:01:04.439> although<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.729> your

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
overall fitness levels although if your

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
overall fitness levels although if your
goal<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:07.530> different<00:01:07.950> let's<00:01:08.280> say<00:01:08.369> if

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
goal is a little different let's say if

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.210 
goal is a little different let's say if
your<00:01:08.610> goal<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> build<00:01:09.900> strength<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
your goal is to build strength or if you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550 
your goal is to build strength or if you
want<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> build<00:01:11.729> muscle<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> wanna

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
want to build muscle or if you wanna

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.670 
want to build muscle or if you wanna
lose<00:01:13.799> body<00:01:14.159> fat<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.200> tweak

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
lose body fat then you have to tweak

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.370 
lose body fat then you have to tweak
these<00:01:16.979> combinations<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.869> for

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
these combinations a little bit more for

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
these combinations a little bit more for
example<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.130> goal<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> build

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
example if your goal is to build

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
example if your goal is to build
strength<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> reduce<00:01:22.080> your

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
strength then you have to reduce your

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520 
strength then you have to reduce your
cardiovascular<00:01:23.330> training<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.350> as

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
cardiovascular training by as much as

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370 
cardiovascular training by as much as
90%<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:27.180> goal<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> let's<00:01:27.810> say<00:01:27.960> only

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
90% if your goal is to let's say only

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.960 
90% if your goal is to let's say only
build<00:01:28.860> muscle<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.310> lose<00:01:29.369> body<00:01:29.880> fat

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
build muscle and lose body fat

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
build muscle and lose body fat
simultaneously<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> combination<00:01:31.650> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
simultaneously then the combination can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.929 
simultaneously then the combination can
be<00:01:32.189> nubert<00:01:32.579> 70/30<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:34.439> goal<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.829> only<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
be nubert 70/30 if your goal is only to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.149 
be nubert 70/30 if your goal is only to
reduce<00:01:36.030> body<00:01:36.360> fat<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.500> give<00:01:37.680> equal

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
reduce body fat then I would give equal

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
reduce body fat then I would give equal
weight<00:01:38.430> H<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.909> both<00:01:39.119> strength<00:01:39.840> training<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
weight H to both strength training and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
weight H to both strength training and
also<00:01:41.119> cardiovascular<00:01:42.119> training<00:01:42.500> personally

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
also cardiovascular training personally

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
also cardiovascular training personally
I<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.340> strength<00:01:45.270> training<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.720> alternate

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I do a strength training on alternate

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
I do a strength training on alternate
days<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.040> some<00:01:47.790> form<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
days and I do some form of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.179 
days and I do some form of
cardiovascular<00:01:48.540> activity<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.590> alternate

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
cardiovascular activity on alternate

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
cardiovascular activity on alternate
days<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.630> day<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:51.990> lot

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
days so you know one day I would do lot

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
days so you know one day I would do lot
multi-joint<00:01:52.710> exercises<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.939> other

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
multi-joint exercises and the other

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
multi-joint exercises and the other
alternate<00:01:54.630> days<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.049> would<00:01:55.470> end<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.710> playing

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
alternate days I would end up playing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
alternate days I would end up playing
let's<00:01:56.430> say<00:01:56.549> squash<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.180> play<00:01:57.719> football<00:01:57.960> I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
let's say squash or play football I

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
let's say squash or play football I
would<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.500> some<00:01:58.680> sort<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.860> running<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> like<00:02:00.000> I
