00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on the outside of it and then I sanded

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
on the outside of it and then I sanded
it<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.860> painted<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.090> white

to go into that one to make the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
to go into that one to make the
dimensions<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> hole<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.819> back<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
this if you don't have a box to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.800 
this if you don't have a box to
as<00:02:11.550> where<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.060> always<00:02:12.210> just<00:02:12.420> grab<00:02:12.660> the

cat's tracking litter outside the box I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.590 
cat's tracking litter outside the box I
placed<00:02:18.570> these<00:02:18.870> cardboard<00:02:20.300> scratch<00:02:21.300> pads

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
placed these cardboard scratch pads

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.900 
placed these cardboard scratch pads
outside<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.160> come<00:02:23.370> out<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> box

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
outside so when they come out of the box

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.420 
outside so when they come out of the box
they<00:02:24.330> actually<00:02:24.660> scratch<00:02:25.020> their<00:02:25.290> paws<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.980> get

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
they actually scratch their paws and get

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.710 
they actually scratch their paws and get
all<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.700> litter<00:02:26.880> off<00:02:27.120> before<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.600> even

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
all that litter off before they even

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.930 
all that litter off before they even
walk<00:02:27.990> back<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.440> room<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.700> went<00:02:29.790> out

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
walk back into the room I then went out

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.240 
walk back into the room I then went out
to<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.660> fabric<00:02:31.260> store<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.530> bought<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to the fabric store and bought this

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.780 
to the fabric store and bought this
fabric<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:34.200> bought<00:02:34.410> two<00:02:34.740> large<00:02:35.340> pieces<00:02:35.610> of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
fabric and I bought two large pieces of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.260 
fabric and I bought two large pieces of
foam<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.530> cut<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> foam<00:02:38.160> out<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
foam and I just cut the foam out to the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.760 
foam and I just cut the foam out to the
size<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> lid<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.190> stapled<00:02:41.820> this

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
size of the lid and then I stapled this

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.830 
size of the lid and then I stapled this
fabric<00:02:43.770> around<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.250> last<00:02:45.120> thing<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.450> did<00:02:45.630> was

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
fabric around it last thing I did was

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.290 
fabric around it last thing I did was
cut<00:02:46.170> out<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.290> hole<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> side<00:02:47.040> place<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.910> vent

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
cut out a hole in the side place a vent

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.840 
cut out a hole in the side place a vent
and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> vent<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> 3-inch

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
and then from the vent I have a 3-inch

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.890 
and then from the vent I have a 3-inch
flux<00:02:51.780> tube<00:02:52.080> going<00:02:52.410> down<00:02:52.710> into<00:02:53.250> an<00:02:53.460> inline<00:02:53.940> fan

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
flux tube going down into an inline fan

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.100 
flux tube going down into an inline fan
motor<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:56.430> from<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> fan<00:02:56.940> motor<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.540> have

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
motor and then from the fan motor I have

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.730 
motor and then from the fan motor I have
another<00:02:58.890> flex<00:02:59.610> tube<00:02:59.970> coming<00:03:00.420> out<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.020> going

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
another flex tube coming out and going

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.310 
another flex tube coming out and going
up<00:03:01.920> into<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.400> window<00:03:02.910> I've<00:03:03.480> made<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.080> way

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
up into the window I've made it this way

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.650 
up into the window I've made it this way
so<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.650> could<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.400> able<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.790> hide<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.450> hose

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
so I could be able to hide this hose

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.390 
so I could be able to hide this hose
when<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.020> want<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:07.770> if<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> starts<00:03:08.310> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
when I want to and then if it starts to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.980 
when I want to and then if it starts to
smell<00:03:08.730> or<00:03:09.000> something<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.300> could<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.630> pull<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
smell or something I could just pull the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.600 
smell or something I could just pull the
hose<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.650> stick<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> window

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
hose out and stick it into the window

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.230 
hose out and stick it into the window
the<00:03:12.120> inline<00:03:12.540> fan<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.440> actually<00:03:13.950> hooked<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.610> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
the inline fan is actually hooked up to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.810 
the inline fan is actually hooked up to
an<00:03:15.630> adjustable<00:03:16.200> DC<00:03:16.590> motor<00:03:16.890> speed<00:03:17.370> controller

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
an adjustable DC motor speed controller

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540 
an adjustable DC motor speed controller
I<00:03:18.150> wanted<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.960> be<00:03:19.080> able<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.500> turn<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
I wanted to be able to turn it on and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.110 
I wanted to be able to turn it on and
off<00:03:20.730> instead<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.600> unplug<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.760> also<00:03:23.760> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
off instead of unplug it and also be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.960 
off instead of unplug it and also be
able<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.330> control<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> speed<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.610> was<00:03:26.850> my

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
able to control the speed so that was my

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.820 
able to control the speed so that was my
project<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.720> hope<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.200> enjoyed<00:03:28.620> it
