00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hello UTB sm and today I video 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.630
 tell you about such trifles as removal 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.630
 windows.old folders 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.119
 as is known when installing a new version 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 windows 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 if we didn't delete the old she 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 moved to the windows.old folder takes 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:34.170
 pretty much on the hard disk 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 places there are 8 and 15 gigabytes 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.969
 we are certainly not superfluous therefore in this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 video we'll talk about how 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:50.579
 pretty easy and neat to remove 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 these files are wrong for that we need 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.360
 call the disk cleaning service for this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 press start and find in line 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.010
 write the following words 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:22.020
 wedge mzr press enter and here we are 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.010
 disk cleaning device selection select 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.240
 the disk that we want to clean in this 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.240
 case i have drive c 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.090
 here it is the windows.old folder click ok 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.000
 and so passed the test and we need 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.330
 to put 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 choose to clear the system files here 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:08.490
 we have this button from the bottom click on 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.490
 her 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.550
 and so here we opened a window and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.550
 we should put this window 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.550
 tick 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:41.620
 previous install windows set 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.050
 here we see a tick in this case 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:57.840
 we have a previous version of windows takes 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:57.840
 12 half gig here and click ok 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:11.160
 we are asked to confirm 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.160
 click and delete
