00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.420
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.629
 video of me today I'll show you 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.450
 again 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.059
 terrazzano works like the whole 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 the recipes are made that looks 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 you as always in the ticket how can 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.740
 I'll show you the most efficient one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.769
 we need a type of tv 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 a solar cell a health and there 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.750
 we simply connect the terra fauna 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.200
 so you can now all night 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.079
 work through and how it works 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.280
 I'll show you in the following example 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 so that the terra firma work 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 you always have to put these chips on it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.480
 stick 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 Here I show you something 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.789
 happens when you playstation the module 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.829
 put it on when you put the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 module in hand has easy with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.350
 right click install and you see it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 also goes immediately release the finished ation 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 module ensures that everything is on the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 height of the subject is filled up with earth 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 or anything else about it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 is simply removed that's very me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.770
 well, now I am disappearing more and more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.770
 blocks we'll come to the next one 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 Here we have the discussion here 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:43.460
 Let's make a nice big desert 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.729
 you see, that's pretty fix too 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.729
 on we go 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:57.350
 Here we have many places installed 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.910
 and behold, addressed to our desert 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.790
 everything is still there in the back 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.970
 nice with snowfall on it goes to 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.970
 next 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.990
 here we have the kulti which nation 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.950
 the cultivated for that here 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.830
 plants and trees vegetables and everything 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.240
 the irritation causes that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.090
 everything again accelerates it significantly 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.200
 that means that the plants 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.910
 Grow faster if I am here now 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 more trees because zag since come to the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:57.200
 trees you can see it here 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:59.380
 make quite comfortable we come to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380
 last 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.239
 so the funniest dimas worm if it is 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.299
 now a time gone long is coming 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.629
 yes, by the way, the big hits 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:21.040
 comes out that's all trouble 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.870
 with feasible so I just mean is 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.090
 full also for one for earth 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.989
 I just forgot to go though 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.230
 liquid not bad 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.090
 but have a look at yourself now 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.090
 give her a little overview of what 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.310
 has terra firma can do and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.400
 you can see that is really fast here 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.810
 It should not be an overview 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.819
 and I say thank you for that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.819
 watch and see you next time
