00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.710 
called meshes and then you put in here
anywhere<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.910> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.450> do

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
anywhere I'm just going to put it in do

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.719 
anywhere I'm just going to put it in do
V<00:02:09.899> manner<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.319> it's

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
V manner because it's

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.490 
V manner because it's
just<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.599> better<00:02:11.780> when<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.019> suit<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.349> out

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
just it's better when you suit it out

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.820 
just it's better when you suit it out
okay<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.190> Noble<00:02:14.090> table<00:02:14.569> short<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.590> have

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
okay and Noble table short now we have

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.530 
okay and Noble table short now we have
the<00:02:16.099> mesh<00:02:16.970> foot<00:02:17.269> now<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:18.019> need<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.470> texture<00:02:19.540> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the mesh foot now we need the texture so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.910 
the mesh foot now we need the texture so
go<00:02:20.780> back<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.110> textures<00:02:21.560> where<00:02:21.830> you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
go back to the textures where you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.270 
go back to the textures where you
extracted<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.569> go<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.799> exactly<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> same<00:02:25.040> file

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
extracted it go to exactly the same file

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.369 
extracted it go to exactly the same file
location<00:02:25.670> as<00:02:25.790> before<00:02:26.120> noble<00:02:26.569> furniture<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
location as before noble furniture and

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.650 
location as before noble furniture and
it<00:02:28.069> now<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.430> has<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> lot<00:02:28.819> less<00:02:28.970> textures<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it now it has a lot less textures and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.750 
it now it has a lot less textures and
meshes<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.590> because<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> lot<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.250> messages

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
meshes that's because a lot of messages

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.990 
meshes that's because a lot of messages
use<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:31.970> same<00:02:32.150> texture<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.560> never<00:02:34.489> furniture

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
use the same texture so never furniture

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.250 
use the same texture so never furniture
table<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:37.879> go<00:02:38.090> back<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.329> your<00:02:38.480> scar<00:02:38.930> data

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

confusing you okay so we want to change
that<00:04:01.519> texture<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.780> once<00:04:03.230> set<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.560> open<00:04:03.799> up<00:04:03.889> with

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
that texture so once set to open up with

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.819 
that texture so once set to open up with
very<00:04:04.430> Photoshop<00:04:04.910> but<00:04:05.660> obviously<00:04:06.139> yours

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
very Photoshop but obviously yours

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.650 
very Photoshop but obviously yours
probably<00:04:06.949> won't<00:04:07.280> be<00:04:07.400> first<00:04:07.699> time<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.209> open

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
probably won't be first time so open

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.150 
probably won't be first time so open
with<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> derby<00:04:09.139> Photoshop<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.099> then<00:04:13.359> okay<00:04:14.359> and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
with a derby Photoshop and then okay and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.500 
with a derby Photoshop and then okay and
then<00:04:16.160> there's<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> texture<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.120> we're<00:04:17.479> just

table oh one so there's a three textured
table<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:36.840> I<00:06:37.840> don't<00:06:37.990> think<00:06:38.200> I<00:06:38.290> turn<00:06:38.470> the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
table and I don't think I turn the

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.860 
table and I don't think I turn the
lights<00:06:38.740> off<00:06:38.920> lights<00:06:39.190> on<00:06:40.090> in<00:06:40.240> this<00:06:40.330> video<00:06:40.630> but

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
lights off lights on in this video but

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.210 
lights off lights on in this video but
it<00:06:41.050> does<00:06:41.250> you<00:06:42.250> do<00:06:42.400> see<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:42.730> actual<00:06:44.220> alright

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
it does you do see the actual alright

it does you do see the actual alright
never<00:06:46.000> mind<00:06:46.090> about<00:06:46.270> that

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
never mind about that

never mind about that
so<00:06:47.260> that's<00:06:47.770> how<00:06:47.920> you<00:06:47.980> do<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.160> save<00:06:48.520> as<00:06:48.700> right

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
so that's how you do a save as right

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.650 
so that's how you do a save as right
there<00:06:49.150> and<00:06:49.770> then<00:06:50.770> you<00:06:50.890> replace<00:06:51.180> replace<00:06:52.180> it<00:06:52.480> or

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
there and then you replace replace it or

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.820 
there and then you replace replace it or
neighbor<00:06:52.900> as<00:06:53.080> a<00:06:53.110> different<00:06:53.440> thing<00:06:53.560> every<00:06:53.800> time

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
neighbor as a different thing every time

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.800
