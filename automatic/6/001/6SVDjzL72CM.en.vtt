00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
one part because you know i thought it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
probably just going to skip to that part

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:31.209 
probably just going to skip to that part
of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> video<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.800> i<00:00:25.400> am<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:28.039> and

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.430 

I'm<00:00:32.219> gonna<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> face<00:00:32.820> cam<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> I

probably<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.120> too<00:00:39.390> good<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.629> me

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
probably not going to be too good for me

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.090 
probably not going to be too good for me
and<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.180> say<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.809> hundred<00:00:43.230> views

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and it's just say I got a hundred views

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
and it's just say I got a hundred views
on<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> first<00:00:46.680> part<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> figured<00:00:48.890> people

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
on the first part so I figured people

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
on the first part so I figured people
are<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.309> mad<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> stop<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
series right there so I figured I do

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.000
