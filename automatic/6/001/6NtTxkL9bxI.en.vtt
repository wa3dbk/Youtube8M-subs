like sitting lying down or multiple

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060 
like sitting lying down or multiple
things<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.789> day<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> key<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.710> work<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
things in one day the key is to work in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
things in one day the key is to work in
short<00:01:02.609> sessions<00:01:03.149> 5<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.989> 15<00:01:04.409> minutes<00:01:04.830> depending

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
short sessions 5 to 15 minutes depending

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.510 
short sessions 5 to 15 minutes depending
upon<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.580> long<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.939> dog<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.360> work<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
upon how long your dog can work and

upon how long your dog can work and
accomplish<00:01:08.520> something<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
accomplish something and when you get

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960 
accomplish something and when you get
the<00:01:09.900> behavior<00:01:10.409> quit<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> break

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the behavior quit and take a break

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.870 
the behavior quit and take a break
because<00:01:12.290> frequently<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> idea<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
because frequently we like the idea of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
because frequently we like the idea of
well<00:01:15.119> let<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:15.750> time<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
well let me get it one more time that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
well let me get it one more time that
was<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> exciting<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:17.939> it's

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
was so exciting I did it well but it's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
was so exciting I did it well but it's
much<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.390> effective<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> dog<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.460> stop

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
much more effective for the dog to stop

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.039 
much more effective for the dog to stop
on<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> high<00:01:21.180> note<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.840> they've<00:01:22.020> done

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
on a high note and when they've done

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.340 
on a high note and when they've done
something<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.450> marking<00:01:25.020> something

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
something so with with marking something

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
something so with with marking something
you<00:01:26.189> might<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> sit<00:01:27.390> behavior<00:01:27.960> mark<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you might get the sit behavior mark the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:42.539 
you might get the sit behavior mark the
sit<00:01:28.799> stand<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:36.329> stand

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.919 

you<00:01:43.549> can<00:01:43.700> even<00:01:43.819> offer<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.450> treat<00:01:44.659> away

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
you can even offer the treat away

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.929 
you can even offer the treat away
initially<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.979> get<00:01:46.069> your<00:01:46.249> dog<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.429> stand<00:01:46.759> back
