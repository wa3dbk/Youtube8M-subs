00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 give typical dish and that 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 Critically this is a colorful salad with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.059
 You also eat very much vegetables 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.670
 for barbecue and I wish you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 Now have fun for our vulgo salad 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 we need the following things 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 we need two glasses bulgur her 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 you do not have to take the club the ditch 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.699
 then, in the cafÃ©, you will need rice dishes 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.769
 we two glasses of boiling water two 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.260
 Tomato spoon and that's it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.079
 for paprika marc different spices 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 like pepper salt chilli flakes and mint 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 better because of course fresh mint then 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.829
 also the one and a half lemons 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.399
 I already have juice 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 squeezed out as half a glass 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.039
 Half t class then I have otherwise 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.620
 you can also find in the Turkish shop 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.260
 that means it's pomegranate syrup 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.490
 that makes the whole thing a little longer 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 you need a red onion 2 peppers 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.420
 the network is the light from the Turkish 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.729
 not the sharp and then I have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.350
 two more dark ones that sharp so if 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 you could not do it too 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.710
 omit then has now three tomatoes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.150
 then I have a red pointed paprika 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 Half a bridge and spring onions 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.909
 a colorful to prepare we ours 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 bulgur before and then we go with the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 all ingredients continue oh what I still 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.770
 have forgotten and you need a living 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.390
 fresh parsley so give your two 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.390
 glasses and clock in your bowl 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:02.940
 then your boiling water will be yours 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:09.960
 of it now just two glasses over it 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:17.240
 even pour that probably just covered 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 is there a little way 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.790
 and you have to cover that up 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.450
 the plates of dictated it easier 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 surrounded to the side 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:34.319
 already two currently well swells 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.299
 At the beginning whole ingredients could be small too 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.849
 cut it is important that at the 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.950
 So, at your funkuhr salad, all of you 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.670
 Trimmed ingredients quite small 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 become 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.709
 I 've already washed all the ingredients 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.709
 it has been removed 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.779
 so if you have your whole vegetables then so 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.639
 quite small all have cut 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:09.649
 we can continue with the bulgur 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.649
 Now you take your bulgur 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.539
 which has become quite business because 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:31.770
 it wants the reverberant it wants now 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:36.089
 zoo on a local spoon if you like that 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.490
 then you have to give your tomatenmark 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:41.399
 and your paprika market is pure 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.419
 I prefer to give you the 17 songs as well 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.490
 gloves on 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:53.789
 because otherwise you will get quite red fingers 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:58.289
 and fingernails as oil and kneaded the 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:03.300
 now together for as long as one 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:06.330
 homogeneous mass has arisen and 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.349
 some buhs a nice little red 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.360
 takes color 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.009
 You can also bank it with the spoon 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.649
 would have to do it again but me 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.839
 think I am doing much better and also 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:17.879
 more quickly 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:23.249
 So far as I could get your spices 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:27.800
 with and from the pomegranate 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.800
 Serve about three tablespoons 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:42.670
 then he always gives partly egg vegetables 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.670
 add the parsley 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.210
 So I have my vegetables all with the 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.210
 hand cut 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.620
 but if it works too much for you 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.140
 could that be just as blender or otherwise 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.670
 where do I find that mixa I have too 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.130
 But the tip is a shame 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.770
 Wander loses the vegetables pretty much 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.820
 juice and yes that tastes synonymous with 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.770
 not that good tastes great that 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.340
 you then just fold in like this 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:18.200
 So no longer just knead that way 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:21.880
 make good hands so i have 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.620
 Now all my vegetables have been added 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.410
 if you 're done so far time 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.430
 so it's about 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.200
 distribute equally 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:36.070
 give your lemon juice even more 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.070
 because that's me again 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.680
 I hope he makes the recipe and 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.860
 Let me know how you liked it 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.780
 so has my father bulgur 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.970
 Salad out of those I do one more now 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.960
 other collarbone and then the 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.960
 rather we finished
