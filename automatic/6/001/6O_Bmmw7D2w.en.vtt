the<00:03:25.110> take<00:03:25.380> position<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.220> cake<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.910> it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
the take position the cake and that it

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.930 
the take position the cake and that it
will<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.270> now<00:03:27.480> dries<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.350> sticks<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.940> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
will so now dries and it sticks it to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.000 
will so now dries and it sticks it to
the<00:03:30.060> board<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.630> also<00:03:30.780> use<00:03:31.050> royal<00:03:31.290> icing<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the board you can also use royal icing I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.210 
the board you can also use royal icing I
don't<00:03:32.700> tend<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.060> likely<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:34.200> children's<00:03:34.920> cakes

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
don't tend to likely to children's cakes

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.580 
don't tend to likely to children's cakes
to<00:03:35.550> put<00:03:35.760> anything<00:03:36.330> that's<00:03:36.959> got<00:03:37.140> egg<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.440> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
to put anything that's got egg in it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.090 
to put anything that's got egg in it
because<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.660> icing<00:03:40.110> because<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
because that as in the icing because of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.229 
because that as in the icing because of
the<00:03:41.160> fact<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.430> there's<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:41.760> many<00:03:41.820> allergies

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
the fact that there's so many allergies

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.930 
the fact that there's so many allergies
out<00:03:43.080> there<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.860> practice<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.400> me<00:03:44.520> is<00:03:44.580> just

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
out there so the practice for me is just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.760 
out there so the practice for me is just
we're<00:03:45.390> not<00:03:45.720> use<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.020> roll<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.200> think<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.560> much<00:03:46.650> as

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
we're not use it roll I think as much as

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.270 
we're not use it roll I think as much as
we<00:03:46.920> used<00:03:46.950> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
we used to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.330 
we used to
so<00:03:47.850> now<00:03:47.970> I've<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.090> got<00:03:48.360> my<00:03:48.390> bag<00:03:48.980> tap<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.160> tip

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
so now I've just got my bag tap the tip

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.190 
so now I've just got my bag tap the tip
cut<00:03:50.610> off<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.450> I'm<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.840> proceed

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
cut off it so I'm just going to proceed

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.550 
cut off it so I'm just going to proceed
to<00:03:53.959> pipe<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:56.450> detail

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.760 

I'm<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:01.400> squeezing<00:04:01.640> very<00:04:02.090> lightly<00:04:02.330> because

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
I'm just squeezing very lightly because

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.000 
I'm just squeezing very lightly because
chocolate<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:05.020> would<00:04:06.020> get<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.319> would<00:04:06.590> say<00:04:06.800> that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
chocolate I would get I would say that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.770 
chocolate I would get I would say that
this<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.130> now<00:04:07.340> Luke<00:04:07.640> Warren<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.120> chocolate<00:04:08.360> I

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
this is now Luke Warren this chocolate I

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.470 
this is now Luke Warren this chocolate I
try<00:04:09.590> not<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.800> have<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.950> too<00:04:09.980> hot<00:04:10.910> or<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.360> gets

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
try not to have a too hot or it gets

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.430 
try not to have a too hot or it gets
running<00:04:11.870> up<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.540> can<00:04:14.660> feel<00:04:14.840> reads<00:04:15.140> it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
running up so you can feel reads it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.949 
running up so you can feel reads it
shows<00:04:15.950> beautifully<00:04:16.730> where<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.510> lines<00:04:17.690> are

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
shows beautifully where the lines are

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.870 
shows beautifully where the lines are
and<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.560> also<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:19.160> because<00:04:19.489> I'm<00:04:19.730> going<00:04:19.820> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and I also like because I'm going to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.659 
and I also like because I'm going to
smooth<00:04:20.269> along<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> bottom<00:04:20.930> edge<00:04:21.310> also<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.520> like

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
smooth along the bottom edge also I like

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:31.700 
smooth along the bottom edge also I like
to<00:04:22.700> do<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> actual<00:04:23.660> edge<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.110> cake

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.850 

that's<00:04:32.639> one<00:04:32.880> side<00:04:33.150> done<00:04:35.600> outline<00:04:36.600> his

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
that's one side done outline his

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.890 
that's one side done outline his
beautiful<00:04:37.860> body<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.389> said<00:04:42.690> we're<00:04:42.810> going

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
beautiful body like I said we're going

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.999 
beautiful body like I said we're going
to<00:04:42.990> pipe<00:04:43.169> right<00:04:43.500> up<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.830> these<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:45.830> it's<00:04:46.830> not

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
to pipe right up to these so it's not

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.800 
to pipe right up to these so it's not
going<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.490> too<00:04:49.039> obvious

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.300 

probably<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:54.930> as<00:04:55.020> good<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.199> its<00:04:55.470> left<00:04:55.620> hand<00:04:55.889> so

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
probably not as good on its left hand so

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.029 
probably not as good on its left hand so
I<00:04:56.340> design<00:04:56.699> on<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.970> right<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:58.710> may<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:58.889> be

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
I design on the right that may just be

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:05.070 
I design on the right that may just be
nature

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.839 

so<00:05:05.620> we<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:05.919> continue<00:05:08.310> with<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.370> chocolate

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
so we just continue with the chocolate

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.119 
so we just continue with the chocolate
outline<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:12.509> course<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:14.560> most<00:05:14.710> important

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
outline of course the most important

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.920 
outline of course the most important
part<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.430> processes<00:05:16.000> for<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.509> chocolate<00:05:16.840> to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
part is processes for the chocolate to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.540 
part is processes for the chocolate to
set<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:17.830> I'm<00:05:17.889> going<00:05:18.159> to<00:05:18.690> leave<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:19.720> aside<00:05:20.550> for

set so I'm going to leave that aside for

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.170 
set so I'm going to leave that aside for
about<00:05:21.639> 10<00:05:21.970> minutes<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.419> chocolate<00:05:22.720> to<00:05:22.810> set

about 10 minutes to the chocolate to set

you're<00:05:32.289> probably<00:05:32.409> the<00:05:32.590> dishwasher<00:05:33.129> all<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.520> a

you're probably the dishwasher all of a

you're probably the dishwasher all of a
sudden<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.569> loses<00:05:35.110> its<00:05:35.319> quite<00:05:36.240> good<00:05:37.240> shininess

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
sudden it loses its quite good shininess

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.659 
sudden it loses its quite good shininess
it<00:05:38.229> actually<00:05:38.530> goes<00:05:38.680> through<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.919> very<00:05:39.250> very

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
it actually goes through a very very

it actually goes through a very very

as<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.469> have<00:05:44.680> here<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.340> it's<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.580> lot<00:05:45.729> of

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
as we have here so it's a lot of

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.360 
as we have here so it's a lot of
difference<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.349> don't<00:05:47.409> like<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.009> cook<00:05:48.159> once
