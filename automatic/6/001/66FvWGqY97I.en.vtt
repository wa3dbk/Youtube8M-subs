00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello how am i mister jl 11 and os 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.480
 I bring another mother game mode in 13 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.370
 in which we create our player 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.220
 personalized 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.180
 in the position we want and the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 characteristics that we want also for 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 example in receivers 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 it seems to me that there are three types besides you 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 they put the example of a player so that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.380
 you see more or less how is that going to be 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 player style as I chose one of kind 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.500
 calvin johnson the truth that I think I 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 spend a bit with the size because I 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.770
 as measured in feet and not one I get by 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.540
 I think it happens a bit to me as you see with 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.910
 as a new escort he practically took 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.080
 a head with him and a touchdown 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 and good you can choose the player who 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 you want as I say in the position that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 you want today you will choose which player to 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.790
 what team you want to go and it's very good 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.050
 this year because you can create a league 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.710
 between several and power that if each one with 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.750
 a team 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.690
 and you can play matches among yourselves 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.570
 controlling we're going to single player 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 both attack and defense and I see it 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.450
 especially useful to learn to 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.970
 control some some players in 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.729
 defense for example the mba that alone 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.710
 safeties if you do not handle very well with 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.690
 they created 1 and so you will learn to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.160
 control it 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.450
 the truth that is quite important 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.520
 control a well control a safety or 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.120
 a linebacker the truth that helps a lot 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 here I allow myself a trip to the stands 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.410
 I hang there with the spectators like 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.290
 does not want the thing but I go back to the field and 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.340
 we take this victory I hope that you 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.900

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.900
