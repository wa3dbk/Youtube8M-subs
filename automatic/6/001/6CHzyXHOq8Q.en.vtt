there's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> built-in<00:00:19.230> feature<00:00:19.680> under<00:00:19.980> trade

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
there's a built-in feature under trade

there's a built-in feature under trade
skill<00:00:20.580> master<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.240> open<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.660> up<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.369> go<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
skill master if you open it up you go to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.759 
skill master if you open it up you go to
module<00:00:23.939> operations<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:26.510> then<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.810> auctioning

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
module operations and then to auctioning

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
module operations and then to auctioning
and<00:00:29.420> there's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> place<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> create<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and there's a place here to create a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920 
and there's a place here to create a
macro<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.940> binds<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.630> scroll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
macro and it binds it to your scroll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.560 
macro and it binds it to your scroll
wheel<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:35.040> mine<00:00:35.280> bound<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
wheel I have mine bound to go up and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.270 
wheel I have mine bound to go up and
down<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.190> keep<00:00:38.190> using<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> modifier<00:00:39.629> control

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
down and keep using the modifier control

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.830 
down and keep using the modifier control
so<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.610> creating<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.120> macro<00:00:42.390> first

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so when you're creating this macro first

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
so when you're creating this macro first
of<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.260> sure<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> free<00:00:44.309> macro

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of all make sure you have a free macro

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.690 
of all make sure you have a free macro
space<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.450> macro<00:00:46.020> logbook<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.489> type

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
space in your macro logbook you can type

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
space in your macro logbook you can type
/<00:00:48.270> macro<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.230> bring<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:50.090> then<00:00:51.289> sometimes

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
/ macro to bring that up then sometimes

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
/ macro to bring that up then sometimes
if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> click<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.949> once<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.550> won't<00:00:53.820> actually

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
if you click this once it won't actually

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.049 
if you click this once it won't actually
bind<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> click<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> few

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
bind so I find if you click it a few

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
bind so I find if you click it a few
times<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.719> you'll<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.989> safe<00:00:58.230> after<00:00:59.210> that's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
times and you'll be safe after that's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
times and you'll be safe after that's
made<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.320> post<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.800> options

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
made then you can post your options

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
made then you can post your options
using<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> macro<00:01:03.589> however<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.909> more

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
using the macro however if you have more

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.190 
using the macro however if you have more
than<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:06.900> page<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.150> it's<00:01:09.150> scrollable<00:01:09.900> if

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
than one page and it's scrollable if

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
than one page and it's scrollable if
your<00:01:10.680> most<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> over<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> auction<00:01:12.210> house

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
your most is over this auction house

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
your most is over this auction house
that<00:01:12.840> while<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.380> trying<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> post<00:01:14.010> and

that while you're trying to post and
you're<00:01:15.330> spamming<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.990> macro<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.619> may<00:01:17.159> not

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you're spamming your macro it may not

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.749 
you're spamming your macro it may not
work<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.759> may<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:17.939> scroll<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.759> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
work it may just scroll up and down so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
work it may just scroll up and down so
to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.970> sure<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> works<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.259> most<00:01:22.500> off
