00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.820
 The West African waters are known for their rich marine life. 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.580
 This involves many species of birds and fish ... 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 ... but also for marine mammals such as dolphins and whales. 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.360
 Sword whales hunt sea turtles here. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.360
 But orcas are not the only ones who are after them. 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.820
 In some countries on the West African coast ... 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:27.700
 ... is eating sea turtles and sometimes a dolphin or small whale ... 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.979
 ... a custom rooted in tradition. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.718
 Our ancestors used to catch ... 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.059
 ... dolphins, sea turtles and whales. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.220
 But today they no longer go out on the high seas ... 

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:52.660
 ... and there are motorized boats that come to sell us turtles. 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.020
 Because large factory trawlers from Europe and Asia ... 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.179
 ... emptying West Africa's fish stocks ... 

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:01.700
 ... scientists fear that people might be forced ... 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.860
 ... turn to food sources other than fish. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.760
 Eating so-called "sea game" could make an advance. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 We are concerned that in a country like Ghana ... 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 ... scientists have found that fishermen are increasingly hunting marine mammals ... 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.720
 ... because they can't catch enough fish. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 They hunt dolphins and whales as an alternative to food and income. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 And the research in Ghana clearly shows ... 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.320
 ... that marine mammals are hunted more when there is less fish. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.500
 A direct link between overfishing and hunting ... 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.260
 ... on "sea game" is not easy to determine. 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 But Karim, a fisherman and ranger from Senegal ... 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.540
 ... is convinced of the link between fishing pressure ... 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.740
 ... and the increasing demand for turtle meat. 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 Over the past 50 years ... 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.260
 ... many species have disappeared, such as the white saw bass and the dorade. 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.620
 Otherwise the sea turtles are in good shape. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.480
 Their number has even increased due to protection. 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.818
 That means it is now easier for a sea turtle ... 

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:11.600
 ... to catch a white saw bass. 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.659
 Overfishing therefore has a real impact on fishing ... 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.440
 ... and leads to an increase in the hunt for sea turtles. 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.939
 If other countries were to follow the example of Ghana ... 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 ... then marine biodiversity, together with fish stocks ... 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.379
 ... and the existence of local fishermen ... 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.859
 ... possibly the next victim of overfishing off West Africa's coast.
