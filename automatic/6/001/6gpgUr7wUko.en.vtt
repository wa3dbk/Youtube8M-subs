00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.080
is it possible, that a computer program

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.100
can crash because of a piece of music?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.150
I found it by a lucky chance

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.050
with scanning the sheet music

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.900
Just this  piece does the  crash

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.620
It is from "Orgelbüchlein"

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.610
I want to show it to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.420
I put the sheet into the scanner and start the program

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.470
Now I'll push the button OCR

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.000
The screen gets black  - then the restart

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.510
I am sure, it will work

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.060
The computer is right

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:56.930
Bach had changed the note values in a way

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.900
that is wrong - spoken with mathematics

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.870
I discovered it because of the crash

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.840
I compared it with Bach's handwriting

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.560
He wrote the wrong rhythm, which led to the crash. - Why?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.120
I want to demonstrate you a music software

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.020
I am doing just the same as Bach did

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.120
look, the first measure is not filled completely with the eighth triplets

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.690
He should have written fourth triplets

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.470
Then these nine notes would fill the measure completely

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.100
It is very unlikely, that Bach didn't know the measures

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.370
the whole page is full of wrong triplets

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.730
and be sure, he served for a certain purpose

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.550
Notes are always symbols

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.370
melodies are secret codes, that you can see with your eyes

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.230
He wanted to accentuate something

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.310
Look at the notes as if you look on a picture

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.880
He wrote the eighth triplets himself, not only once, but through the whole piece

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.160
The contrast are the quarter notes - four times.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.270
The number four  - four thousand years waiting for the arrival of Messiah

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.570
The notes sound like a clock

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.050
They are a contrast to the eighth triplets

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.600
not only for the ears, but also for the eyes

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.360
We find the number four again in the two voices of both canons

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.870
On top the melody-canon and his answer

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:10.810
the accompany-canon (the eighth triplets and his answer too) - the offset of the fourth notes.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.630
Again the number four - four voices

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:38.290
The flowing of time is demonstrated with striking clocks on note "a" in contrast to the eighth triplets

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.800
The optical contrast is even more obvious with the eighth triplets instead of fourth triplets

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.090
It is not only an audible expression but also an optical expression

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.530
…although it is a wrong beat in rhythm

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.330
Thank you for listening!
