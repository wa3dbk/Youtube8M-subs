he still has to save his girlfriend too

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.669 
he still has to save his girlfriend too
so<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.270> still<00:01:34.509> great<00:01:34.750> concept<00:01:35.380> for<00:01:35.440> this

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
so it's still great concept for this

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.240 
so it's still great concept for this
game<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:37.270> would<00:01:37.479> be<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.959> defeat<00:01:38.380> Oscar<00:01:38.979> and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
game that would be to defeat Oscar and

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.600 
game that would be to defeat Oscar and
of<00:01:39.940> course<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.690> save<00:01:40.959> your<00:01:41.470> girlfriend<00:01:41.709> Irene

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
of course to save your girlfriend Irene

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.740 
of course to save your girlfriend Irene
so<00:01:43.450> that's<00:01:44.020> basically<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.069> concept<00:01:45.750> controls

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
so that's basically the concept controls

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.350 
so that's basically the concept controls

also can cling to walls again but this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830 
also can cling to walls again but this
time<00:02:14.890> which<00:02:15.819> makes<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.209> game<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.660> much

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
time which makes this game so much

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.980 
time which makes this game so much
better<00:02:17.110> as<00:02:17.410> Ryo<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.340> basically<00:02:18.700> climb<00:02:19.360> every

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
better as Ryo can basically climb every

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.690 
better as Ryo can basically climb every
single<00:02:20.319> surface<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.950> don't<00:02:21.130> have<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> jump

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
single surface so you don't have to jump

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.760 
single surface so you don't have to jump
from<00:02:21.849> wall<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> wall<00:02:22.300> he<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.170> climb<00:02:23.410> open

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
from wall to wall he can climb open

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.330 
from wall to wall he can climb open
anything<00:02:24.250> which<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.510> totally<00:02:26.230> improves<00:02:26.680> on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
anything which just totally improves on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
anything which just totally improves on
the<00:02:27.400> original<00:02:27.610> ninja<00:02:28.300> gaiden<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.840> makes<00:02:29.050> this

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the original ninja gaiden and makes this

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.710 
the original ninja gaiden and makes this
game<00:02:29.470> feel<00:02:29.950> more<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.180> controlling<00:02:31.569> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
game feel more like you're controlling a
