00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 I 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.059
 you are subscribed but we end up 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.920
 for the three-point contest 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.440
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.879
 very well today and gaza your 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.040
 igloo a little special knowing that we 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.340
 approach of 600 subscribers thanks for that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 anyway 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 but I 'm getting mostly more and more 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.860
 messages from people asking me for 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.050
 advice on how to progress 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.190
 better spell how to apply and in there 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.250
 thinking I realized 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.829
 that apart from 2-3 tutorials you do not have too much 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.510
 actually helped to progress while good 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.700
 without wishing to boast, judge rather a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.520
 good level in any case in general and 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.840
 especially with player for proof to 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.869
 the time when there was a ranking by 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 report to the crew what in crew mode you 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.110
 have in the global clean dock what 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.850
 is one of the two best French with 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500
 pedro for those who do not know who 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.460
 is pedro click on the link below to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.860
 left but now I think I can 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.140
 give you some tips that you 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.610
 will help to progress 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.380
 first point is surely the most 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 important in any case for me what 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 has allowed me to be as successful as 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 sit good league iver 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.580
 is that mid-range shooting must 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.800
 become your main weapon in attack 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.930
 the best to help you understand that 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.030
 that's how you explain with 38 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.790
 managed to rank 19th worldwide at 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.860
 the time of the coup mode is actually from 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.600
 we create our player we increase 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.600
 and mid-distance shooting in 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 priority what happened in match our 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.370
 forums it was to find 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.050
 Copenhagen positions distance though this 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.000
 either by luan oil and fixings them 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.160
 systems finally voices that we himself 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480
 or to be open at three points 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.460
 take a step forward to take my 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.670
 boxer distances to explain you to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.440
 how much the game was based on it 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.020
 why it works and so well 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.670
 just because the mid distance to a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 very high success rate but very 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 easily turn over 70% to all 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.330
 matches while also you take 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.530
 the 3-point you turn between 40 and 60% 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.230
 if you are good 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.730
 and the second effect is that once 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 that you will send chained halfway 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.800
 2010 time 3000 distance to 4th lift on 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.730
 defender van good i'm going i'm coming 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.890
 jump up 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.540
 the defender and in the air you know 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.880
 more than to penetrate the identical or if 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.410
 a player comes to help you come out on 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.459
 a penis player would create a 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.380
 shift finally this is called 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.780
 association what 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.670
 and that's it creates the game and it sows the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.040
 doubt in the defender's head 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.920
 on the contrary if you are I based 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.940
 on the penetration for example but you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.790
 do not manage the mid distance 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140
 just a simple zone or a 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.580
 dwight howard in the racket and you 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 are brought what while on all 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.470
 areas 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.930
 there is a weak point halfway away you 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.910
 take the area a right for example 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.900
 you go to the corners at a distance 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.430
 3.2 is open so a little exercise 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.710
 simple to help you progress there 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.030
 on it is to make matches in you 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.570
 fixing as a rule not to exceed 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.430
 the 50% points neither in the racket 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.470
 and more than a third of shots taken at three 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.390
 points so if for example you put 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.980
 50 during the match was not expected 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.680
 exceed 25 points in the racket 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.920
 and if you saw 30 shots in the game 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.750
 you must not exceed 10 shots 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 taken at three points at the end of the match 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.320
 you go in this team that you 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.330
 check that you have respected here 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.740
 of rules and doing that on all 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.240
 matches by chaining m like that you 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.830
 know that you will progress very 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.140
 quickly attack 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.330
 once you have assimilated this point 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.580
 I move to the second one which consists of 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.310
 expand its blues range and there ya 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.260
 unfortunately not that secret camp 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.850
 workout the tutorial is very 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 well done what there is no reason 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.330
 against all the do not or in any 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.800
 case that's what I do as soon as they 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.140
 buy the game i go home i the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.520
 instruction tutorials and ultra 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.560
 well done so there is no reason to 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.690
 not do it if a move you galley 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.430
 to assimilate the best is to try to 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.540
 to place a match like that he does not enter 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.099
 even more easily 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.079
 why break your head to do everything 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.909
 that bah just imagine that you 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.320
 fell on a very big gender defender 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.079
 the guy who will leave you no position 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.789
 open and well have a wide range of 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.590
 new loans will allow me to what 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.780
 that it happens to create a shoot from 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.940
 of nothing for example if you have 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.919
 simply the spin supporting josiane of 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.240
 shot you know how do you get that 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.310
 to place it once or twice without a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
 big defender but not stronger then 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.100
 if you arrive you do it a swing 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.169
 shoot then the next time you arrive 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.090
 steinbach the next time you animate up 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.400
 and under tang wei as varied all the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.960
 time 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.210
 right away you get even more from 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.400
 all in the head of the key defender of the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.870
 voting games and money done then that will be 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.370
 complicated defend after it therefore 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.699
 big goal is to become 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.500
 unpredictable third time mound of 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.020
 his success says basic and your of his 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.930
 mutism years but tries to handle a 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.150
 maximum of timing for up to 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.430
 binder what not just spam 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.430
 also the little players with nachi 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.180
 all summer djeridi kyle korver sent a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.910
 little tip stuff 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.410
 why it's interesting because 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.090
 like that the opponent when you are a 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.560
 simple match what 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.990
 the opponent will never be with whom 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.560
 you can pull no more complicated to 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.610
 defend and it's also a plus without 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.350
 michael york because you can 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.699
 always fall on a streak hot chip 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.090
 and a little player that will please you 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.440
 what 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.970
 for is reassigned to your my player 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.800
 then like me for example especially 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.690
 what is 11 taking the jazz I had 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.669
 realized that the flush of the 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.560
 beautiful I put everything with it ends up 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.330
 to be saying it that I attributed before the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.340
 half an hour and that's it and keep 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.750
 all year long so do not limit yourself 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.460
 to the stars also try to handle a 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.560
 maximum number of players kept 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.780
 always one more the best way for 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.720
 that's going to go into settings options 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.250
 presentation game is activated on 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.600
 comment after shoot that would tell you 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.979
 if he had done a good timing 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.840
 if you made it too short or too 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.760
 long what and so it's the simplest 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.000
 to know if they master in europe to 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.560
 what finally the last point is there 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.680
 relates exclusively to the mode ma 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.240
 career avoid play styles 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.090
 three point shooter 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.760
 defenders if the style of play 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.919
 three-point shooter interests you 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.479
 prefer the score game style if the 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.020
 know the defender style that you 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.870
 interested 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.280
 prefer the athletic style of play in 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.350
 choosing these two styles rather than 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.419
 the other two you will have the same 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.449
 advantages at least of disadvantages so 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.400
 that's all benef foolishly trust 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.440
 three-point shooter defenders to 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.270
 avoid favorite athletic and scorer 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.770
 finally here it was some small 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.630
 advice like that on the attack 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.890
 if you have questions I can 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.120
 always try to answer them 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.790
 you send them to me either 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.510
 comments but here we come to my 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.060
 last passage 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.190
 ryan anderson made 21 that's the score at 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.830
 beat so I'll let you handle 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.450
 its not in any case I rather who does 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.500
 the three-point contest I believe that 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.670
 it was last year he was 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.460
 rotten but this year's one has 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.430
 really well done i think i had 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.230
 badly started against three out of five 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.230
 it's not terrible to catch up on 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:14.230
 this one iraq perfect timing 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:16.430
 aline perfect timing perfect and fire 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.130
 Iraq last is not serious and 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.480
 adrenaline mounts epic music 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.080
 does that mean something 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.360
 sexy we chained splash beach did not 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:35.240
 does not feel like 11 points
