00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
itself so you're just rolling it I'm

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.050 
itself so you're just rolling it I'm
folding<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.250> itself

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.420 

um<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.689> roll<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.619> itself<00:01:59.040> like

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
um so just roll it in on itself like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.780 
um so just roll it in on itself like
that<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.219> sting<00:02:02.460> yourself

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that and then you don't sting yourself

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
that and then you don't sting yourself
so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.090> rolled<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.979> look<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.219> sushi

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so it's rolled up look a little sushi

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320 
so it's rolled up look a little sushi
roll<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> suppose<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

just pop it in your mouth and chew which
is<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.250> exciting<00:02:15.790> when<00:02:16.000> you've<00:02:16.180> never<00:02:16.360> done<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
is so exciting when you've never done it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.720 
is so exciting when you've never done it
before<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.320> you're<00:02:17.470> like<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.890> can't

know these grass stems and just taking
the<00:03:08.890> end<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.250> them<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.640> don't<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.209> what<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the end of them I don't know what the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.270 
the end of them I don't know what the
nutritional<00:03:10.840> value<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.739> I'm<00:03:11.860> sure<00:03:12.070> there

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
nutritional value is but I'm sure there

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.240 
nutritional value is but I'm sure there
is<00:03:12.370> some<00:03:12.610> from<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:13.709> trim<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.920> end<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
is some from just trim the end of the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.610 
is some from just trim the end of the
grass<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.790> that's<00:03:16.420> another<00:03:16.660> thing<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.959> do<00:03:17.230> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
grass so that's another thing to do and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.340 
grass so that's another thing to do and
anyway<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.730> enjoyed<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:19.330> clip<00:03:19.630> I'm<00:03:20.050> not

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
anyway if you enjoyed this clip I'm not

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.440 
anyway if you enjoyed this clip I'm not
just<00:03:20.590> all<00:03:20.769> about<00:03:20.800> raw<00:03:21.280> food<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.730> foraging<00:03:22.269> I'm

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
just all about raw food and foraging I'm

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900 
just all about raw food and foraging I'm
actually<00:03:22.830> about<00:03:23.830> evolving<00:03:24.340> consciousness

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
actually about evolving consciousness

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.550 
actually about evolving consciousness
which<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.360> about<00:03:25.600> foraging<00:03:26.140> because<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.350> think

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
which is about foraging because I think

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.900 
which is about foraging because I think
when<00:03:26.680> we<00:03:26.800> evolve<00:03:27.040> our<00:03:27.160> consciousness<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.790> get

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
when we evolve our consciousness we get

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.460 
when we evolve our consciousness we get
into<00:03:28.209> wolf<00:03:28.420> food<00:03:28.600> eating<00:03:28.959> but<00:03:29.080> I'm<00:03:29.200> about

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
into wolf food eating but I'm about

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.540 
into wolf food eating but I'm about
healing<00:03:29.800> yourself

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
healing yourself

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.670 
healing yourself
I<00:03:30.720> created<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.840> therapy<00:03:32.260> called<00:03:32.500> soul

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
I created the therapy called soul

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.199 
I created the therapy called soul
freedom<00:03:33.070> therapy<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.580> I'm<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> past<00:03:34.000> life

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
freedom therapy and I'm a past life
