other three four solid that one that
one's<00:01:14.220> better<00:01:14.400> stop<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> past<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.360> one's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
one's better stop in the past this one's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
better stop in the run what this stops

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.550 
better stop in the run what this stops
the<00:01:19.049> past<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the past just as well this can just this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
the past just as well this can just this
can<00:01:22.799> stop<00:01:23.040> everything<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:23.850> actually

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can stop everything pretty much actually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
can stop everything pretty much actually
because<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.200> bring<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.619> much<00:01:25.740> pressure<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
because you bring so much pressure it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
because you bring so much pressure it's
I<00:01:26.610> mean<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.259> impossible<00:01:28.790> really<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.140> not<00:01:31.140> get

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I mean it's impossible really to not get

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
I mean it's impossible really to not get
set<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.540> under<00:01:33.810> center

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
set if you're if you're under center

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.560 
set if you're if you're under center
it's<00:01:34.320> impossible<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
it's impossible not to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.399 
it's impossible not to
