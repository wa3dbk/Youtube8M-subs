what is going on stay guys Tom captain
today<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.780> are<00:00:03.929> back<00:00:04.080> with<00:00:04.560> some<00:00:04.770> footage<00:00:05.009> of

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
today we are back with some footage of

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
today we are back with some footage of
the<00:00:05.520> crew<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.970> new<00:00:06.089> expansion<00:00:06.509> pack<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the crew the new expansion pack for the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.450 
the crew the new expansion pack for the
crew<00:00:07.200> now<00:00:07.379> we're<00:00:07.919> gonna<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.130> looking<00:00:08.250> at

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
crew now we're gonna be looking at

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040 
crew now we're gonna be looking at
mainly<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.910> video<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> monster

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
mainly in this video is the monster

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.990 
mainly in this video is the monster
truck<00:00:10.290> mode<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> then<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.309> monster<00:00:11.730> arena

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
truck mode and then in the monster arena

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.810 
truck mode and then in the monster arena
now<00:00:12.330> we've<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.200> massively<00:00:14.040> modified<00:00:14.519> Ford

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
now we've got massively modified Ford

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.250 
now we've got massively modified Ford
Raptors<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.509> basically<00:00:15.839> Ford<00:00:16.109> Raptor

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
Raptors but basically Ford Raptor

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.189 
Raptors but basically Ford Raptor
monster<00:00:16.650> trucks<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.970> objective<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.750> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
monster trucks and your objective is to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.160 
monster trucks and your objective is to
basically<00:00:19.500> run<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.670> arena<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.990> as

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
basically run on this arena and get as

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.070 
basically run on this arena and get as
score<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.560> many<00:00:22.800> points<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:24.080> while

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
score as many points as you can while

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.000 
score as many points as you can while
you<00:00:25.170> battle<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.560> against<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> other

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
you battle it out against the other

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
you battle it out against the other
players<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.359> interesting<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.960> was

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
players now the interesting thing was

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
players now the interesting thing was
the<00:00:28.410> physics<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.310> normally<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the physics because normally with I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
the physics because normally with I
think<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> anything<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.349> involves<00:00:31.679> monster

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
think of anything that involves monster

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
think of anything that involves monster
trucks<00:00:32.369> you're<00:00:32.489> expecting<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> physics<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
trucks you're expecting the physics to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
trucks you're expecting the physics to
be<00:00:33.480> kind<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.989> odd<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.130> guess<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.460> say

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
be kind of the odd I guess you could say

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
be kind of the odd I guess you could say
the<00:00:35.790> physics<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.570> kind<00:00:37.110> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the physics to be kind of them kind of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.319 
the physics to be kind of them kind of
strange<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:39.059> really

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
strange and not not really not really

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
strange and not not really not really
feels<00:00:39.600> super<00:00:39.960> responsive<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> I'd<00:00:41.550> say

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
feels super responsive but and I'd say

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.319 
feels super responsive but and I'd say
as<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.239> completely<00:00:43.050> fail<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.649> flip<00:00:43.890> but

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
as I can completely fail a back flip but

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.369 
as I can completely fail a back flip but
one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> coolest<00:00:45.780> things<00:00:46.020> about<00:00:46.140> driving

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
one of the coolest things about driving

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.600 
one of the coolest things about driving
these<00:00:46.620> monster<00:00:46.890> trucks<00:00:47.070> around<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.550> they

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
these monster trucks around is that they

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
these monster trucks around is that they
actually<00:00:47.789> feel<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> monster<00:00:49.590> truck<00:00:49.770> they

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
actually feel for a monster truck they

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
actually feel for a monster truck they
feel<00:00:50.309> quite<00:00:50.700> responsive<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> mean

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
feel quite responsive actually I mean

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.350 
feel quite responsive actually I mean
the<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:53.309> give<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:54.180> nice

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the thing is they give you a really nice

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000 
the thing is they give you a really nice
kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> area<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> play<00:00:55.860> around

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
kind of area to just kind of play around

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
kind of area to just kind of play around
with<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.399> trucks<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.109> it's<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.559> cool

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
with these trucks and it's really cool

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
with these trucks and it's really cool
the<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.250> things<00:00:59.520> jump<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> way

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the way these things jump the way

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
the way these things jump the way
they've<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> fly<00:01:00.989> through<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.260> air<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
they've kind of fly through the air the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
they've kind of fly through the air the
way<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.489> adjustments<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
way you can make little adjustments to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
way you can make little adjustments to
him<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> air<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.559> also<00:01:04.799> by<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> way

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
him in the air and and also by the way

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.710 
him in the air and and also by the way
the<00:01:05.369> way<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> dirt<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> kicks<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.570> all

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the way the dirt kind of kicks up all

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
the way the dirt kind of kicks up all
over<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> truck<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:08.220> nice<00:01:08.369> effect

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
over the truck is a really nice effect

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
over the truck is a really nice effect
too<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> chance<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> go

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
too now I did not get a chance to go

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.490 
too now I did not get a chance to go
through<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> loop<00:01:11.220> unfortunately<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> did<00:01:12.240> not

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
through the loop unfortunately I did not

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
through the loop unfortunately I did not
didn't<00:01:13.500> come<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> loop<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> right

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
didn't come at the loop from the right

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
didn't come at the loop from the right
angle<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.570> didn't<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:15.960> didn't

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
angle and it just didn't really didn't

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.719 
angle and it just didn't really didn't
really<00:01:16.680> end<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.860> working<00:01:16.979> hell<00:01:17.250> did<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> went<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
really end up working hell did I went to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
really end up working hell did I went to
go<00:01:17.820> through<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> loop<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.110> did<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> go

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
go through the loop but I did get to go

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.510 
go through the loop but I did get to go
off<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> massive<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:21.920> not<00:01:22.920> even<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.490> even

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
off that massive like not even not even

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
off that massive like not even not even
half<00:01:23.820> pipe<00:01:24.060> things<00:01:24.270> basically<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.140> side

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
half pipe things basically like one side

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
half pipe things basically like one side
of<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> half<00:01:25.770> pipe<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> kept<00:01:27.210> trying<00:01:27.570> kept

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of a half pipe and I kept trying kept

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.149 
of a half pipe and I kept trying kept
trying<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.650> flip<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> was

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
trying to get that back flip it it was

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.620 
trying to get that back flip it it was
it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.850> tricky<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it's a little tricky because you got to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's a little tricky because you got to
learn<00:01:30.750> how<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.200> only<00:01:31.229> learn<00:01:31.590> how<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> time

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
learn how to not only learn how to time

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
learn how to not only learn how to time
it<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.960> close<00:01:34.290> and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.280 
really really excited for this I'm
really<00:03:11.540> really<00:03:11.659> excited<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:12.049> get<00:03:12.139> wrote

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
really really excited to get wrote

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.930

forward<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.680> get<00:03:12.799> released<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.609> think<00:03:13.819> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
forward to get released and I think that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.640 
forward to get released and I think that
there<00:03:14.090> was<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.239> there's<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.810> lot<00:03:14.870> they've<00:03:15.440> done

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
there was a there's a lot they've done

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.830 
there was a there's a lot they've done
with<00:03:15.799> this<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.190> was<00:03:16.400> kind<00:03:16.609> of<00:03:16.639> unexpected

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
with this that was kind of unexpected

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.300 
with this that was kind of unexpected
but<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.870> ended<00:03:18.139> up<00:03:18.260> playing<00:03:18.590> out<00:03:18.709> really

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
but it ended up playing out really

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.430 
but it ended up playing out really
really<00:03:19.579> really<00:03:20.480> nice<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.169> definitely

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
really really nice and it's definitely

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
really really nice and it's definitely
one<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.859> one<00:03:22.129> of<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.250> coolest<00:03:22.609> features<00:03:22.699> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
one of the one of the coolest features I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.879 
one of the one of the coolest features I
think<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.389> me<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:24.290> they've<00:03:24.379> included<00:03:24.620> in

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
think for me that they've included in

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.379 
think for me that they've included in
this<00:03:24.980> new<00:03:25.099> expansion<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.699> I<00:03:25.730> really<00:03:26.209> really

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
this new expansion and I really really

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.670 
this new expansion and I really really
like<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.660> they<00:03:26.720> did<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.900> think<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.379> I

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
like what they did I think it's a I

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.530 
like what they did I think it's a I
think<00:03:27.889> it<00:03:28.160> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.340> adds<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.849> lot<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.359> game

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
think it kind of adds a lot to the game

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.890 
think it kind of adds a lot to the game
while<00:03:30.230> bringing<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.859> sort<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.810> sort<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
while bringing in sort of the sort of

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.689 
while bringing in sort of the sort of
multiple<00:03:33.290> sides<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.829> multiple<00:03:34.190> aspects<00:03:34.549> of

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:34.699 
multiple sides of multiple aspects of

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.939 
multiple sides of multiple aspects of
gameplay<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.690> kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> wouldn't<00:03:36.199> expect<00:03:36.500> but

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
gameplay you kind of wouldn't expect but

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.550 
gameplay you kind of wouldn't expect but
at<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.129> same<00:03:37.340> time<00:03:38.139> it's<00:03:39.139> kind<00:03:39.349> of<00:03:39.379> one<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
at the same time it's kind of one of

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.229 
at the same time it's kind of one of
those<00:03:39.680> things<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.609> it's<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.180> those
