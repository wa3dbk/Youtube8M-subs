00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello guys welcome today here to 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.090
 receive luck as you can see today 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.710
 we are in the 54 today 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.590
 I'm going to teach one thing that I think the 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.299
 It's really going to like a lot, boy. 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.810
 I will teach to change the structure of 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.080
 yours without thanks in a way the truth 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.230
 which is very very useful and that came out yesterday 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 I think so I'm not going to teach how 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.780
 it works as you see here we have a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.030
 killer already done 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.789
 we have three other and we will bring them to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.430
 them structural wall 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.230
 let's do it very quietly like a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.760
 month or how we have to listen to the mosco 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.390
 it is very easy the only thing that we have to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 do that apply on the foot and we do 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.680
 we do this to reduce the height or 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.399
 to put it higher but we stretch 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 as you see is very very very very very very 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.950
 We are going to put it very low 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.229
 well you see very nice 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.250
 now we find a very high we have 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.909
 what to explain in your chacÃ³n 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.649
 We regret as you see 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.289
 the problems they have in this world 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.569
 is that they can be distorted as 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.310
 example the shoes but that is already a 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.770
 of the latest positions in the version 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 1.8 so many of the problems that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 they had not been solved and today we're going 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 to leave it to a structure more or less 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.300
 medium work and this is the maximum 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 let's put it 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.360
 well more or less I think we got there 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 we are going to move him to a unit 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.490
 domestic for you to see how 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.610
 it works the mode let's name it 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.110
 to him and we are going to transfer them to all 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.010
 now drive the machines to 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.350
 also see how they work 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.910
 the interactions in the neighborhood and for 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.760
 that you see the differences in height 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.410
 so now we see you guys hello 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.200
 guys and we're back here and like 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.820
 you see now we are in spring of 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.440
 moved one to the vacuum that the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.410
 true that it has nothing as you can see 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.240
 here and I'm going to as you can see you can 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.910
 appreciate quite well the difference in 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.060
 height between the sims for example is the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.550
 higher is the piece of paper that says let's 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.770
 have it here and let's talk 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.200
 with it that the highest 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.060
 to know less for example 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.260
 you can see the big difference that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.260
 get a head out the truth 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.030
 and nothing the truth that is a pretty mode 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.430
 good because you see now you can see it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.519
 best 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.630
 see how it shows the difference that 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.840
 pull out a head 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.280
 the truth is that it is a pretty mode 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.960
 new 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 and still have to have some improvement 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.820
 but I think it's very interesting already 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.860
 that in the five will be all the same and 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.990
 so we can change also does not give me the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.200
 realism since he is with real life 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.150
 Exactly the same thing happens unless 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.420
 do something like hug so you can see 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.720
 how the muscles and khedira work 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.430
 the muscles that we're going to do something to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.110
 that they have to approach and embrace 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.040
 so you can see the difference in height 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.040
 for example 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.830
 good guys you've already gotten that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.060
 take a little better to make a 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.239
 extraction in which they have to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.980
 zoom in so you can see the difference and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.980
 let's shake the arms 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.220
 so you can see how the thing changes 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.960
 good as you can see the actions 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.880
 there may be some that are a little weird like 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.330
 for example, to narrow between 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.330
 arms 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.040
 now see that they do 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.970
 since he is kissing him a little last 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.810
 movie the truth 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.550
 it seems he is kissing his life 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.040
 the worst is her face 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.040
 and therefore the face of happiness that 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.630
 It has but good as it said in a woman 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.459
 realism but nevertheless some 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.530
 actions were a bit altered in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.840
 the game but well I think this 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.430
 not a bigger problem and if the truth 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.890
 that to the people who install this 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.430
 world cares that this happens because the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.180
 croem to none and can we install 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.639
 perfectly to have sinde 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.650
 different heights 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.180
 so nothing boy I hope that I have 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.550
 liked the mod very much 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.440
 and now I'm going to leave you with the process 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.300
 installation now we see you goodbye 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.480
 hello guys , we're here as you can see 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.270
 here on my computer and now I'm going to 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.060
 teach that I'm not saying in the 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 so that as you can see it serves to 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.160
 modify the height of the 5 moyano that 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.100
 did earlier in the helmet taught how 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.890
 we can make it higher lower and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.830
 as you can see it is very simple so you 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.910
 I'll leave the link this moment link 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.200
 of this link in the description box and 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.390
 all you have to do is 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.000
 explain in the link and it will bring you this 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.100
 monte sims page and you will have to 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.810
 register you so for 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.390
 download this mode you have to have a 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.220
 account on the page although the truth that 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.520
 neither is the only thing that you have for free 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.010
 what to do is register with your 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.020
 your email and it is no longer 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.760
 has more history the truth and good one 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.080
 Once they arrive here, the only thing you have 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.300
 what to give is file here as you see 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.939
 and here, as you can see, a lot of 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.849
 files this as for example the one that 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.520
 they went up yesterday that as you can see here 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.250
 puts a uve that means version and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.180
 different versions there are the 1.1 and 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.340
 since room 1.1 has been improved 1.8 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.439
 say that the one that I had to download in 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.979
 the last one out the last kim 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:09.319
 As you can see, I downloaded the 1.86 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.349
 here and we have to click 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.960
 directly knock out accesses download and 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.680
 As you can see, the truth is very simple 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.680
 They have no more history 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.419
 and once you have what comes 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:26.909
 being this file or you have to come to 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.909
 the folder I have here my folder of 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:32.460
 the same ones of the channel in height and 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:35.669
 you have to give it here right click and 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.499
 be here and this file will be extracted and 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.249
 once you do not have a row to copy the 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:42.180
 file welcome documents 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.080
 electronic 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.080
 24 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.030
 love card here and it gives you right click and 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.210
 paste as you see they do not invite you anymore 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.580
 installed and it is already very simple already 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.740
 has installed the way as you can see is 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.330
 very easy to use so nothing 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.370
 seduced loose but as you liked 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.080
 much the way that as you can see have been 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.450
 solved many errors due to 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.640
 new versions and I hope that I have 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.640
 I liked it a lot and said goodbye
