but<00:01:03.269> in<00:01:03.660> between<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.460> like<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> sample<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.120> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
but in between a like a sample that you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.150 
but in between a like a sample that you
would<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> sample<00:01:07.800> like

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
would get like just as a sample like

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.380 
would get like just as a sample like
scent<00:01:08.370> and<00:01:08.550> like<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> magazine<00:01:08.940> or<00:01:09.180> something

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
scent and like a magazine or something

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
scent and like a magazine or something
and<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.110> full-size<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.860> couldn't<00:01:11.370> have

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and like a full-size so couldn't have

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
and like a full-size so couldn't have
like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> good<00:01:12.720> trail<00:01:12.930> both<00:01:13.079> sides<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.409> guess

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
like a good trail both sides I guess

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.840 
like a good trail both sides I guess
they're<00:01:13.799> probably<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.280> travel<00:01:14.670> sizes

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
they're probably not all travel sizes

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.440 
they're probably not all travel sizes
that<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.329> how<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> kind<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
that that's how I kind of think about it
