port that's basically all you need to do
we<00:00:20.279> also<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> panel<00:00:21.900> mount

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
we also have this as a panel mount

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380 
we also have this as a panel mount
version<00:00:22.380> where<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> wouldn't<00:00:23.789> set<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.180> top<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
version where it wouldn't set on top of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
version where it wouldn't set on top of
the<00:00:24.660> pendant<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> panel

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the pendant but it would have a panel

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
the pendant but it would have a panel
mount<00:00:26.670> USB<00:00:27.210> plug<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
mount USB plug that you can put on the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970 
mount USB plug that you can put on the
side<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.369> pendant<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.449> plug<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> USB<00:00:31.439> disk

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.000 
side of pendant and plug the USB disk
right<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> machine<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> cleaner

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
right into the machine it's a cleaner

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.290 
right into the machine it's a cleaner
installation<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> comes<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.059> either

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
installation so it comes as either

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.520 
installation so it comes as either
external<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.160> panel<00:00:38.160> mount<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:40.290> basically

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
external or panel mount and it basically

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.840 
external or panel mount and it basically
is<00:00:41.540> pretty<00:00:42.540> easy<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.989> install<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> let<00:00:44.610> me<00:00:44.700> show

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
then going to load off the USB disk into

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.670 
then going to load off the USB disk into
the<00:02:16.459> Fidel's<00:02:16.820> memory<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.020> now<00:02:18.140> here's<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the Fidel's memory so now here's the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.449 
the Fidel's memory so now here's the
program<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.640> loaded<00:02:19.940> from<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> USB<00:02:20.870> disk

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
program I just loaded from the USB disk

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.610 
program I just loaded from the USB disk
let's<00:02:22.459> say<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> wanted<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.300> save<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.959> used

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
let's say I wanted to save that I used

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.010 
let's say I wanted to save that I used
the<00:02:24.770> program<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.340> wanted<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> save<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.540> back<00:02:26.750> to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
the program I wanted to save it back to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.470 
the program I wanted to save it back to
the<00:02:27.140> USB<00:02:27.530> disk<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.420> type<00:02:29.780> CD<00:02:30.200> comma<00:02:30.470> 10<00:02:31.480> event

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
the USB disk so I type CD comma 10 event

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.670 
the USB disk so I type CD comma 10 event
by<00:02:32.780> PU<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:34.010> 2<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:35.000> send<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.720> current<00:02:36.110> program<00:02:36.530> in

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
by PU a 2 to send the current program in

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.640 
by PU a 2 to send the current program in

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
memory to the USB disk and then this is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.320 
memory to the USB disk and then this is
call<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.510> something

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
call it something

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.490 
call it something
we<00:02:42.390> want<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> call<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.200> job<00:02:43.560> 1<00:02:44.040> dot<00:02:44.580> txt<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:46.320> an

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
we want to call like job 1 dot txt as an

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.100 
we want to call like job 1 dot txt as an
example<00:02:46.970> when<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> push<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> plus<00:02:48.660> key<00:02:48.930> it's

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
example when I push the plus key it's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.500 
example when I push the plus key it's
now<00:02:49.350> going<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.890> punch<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.550> program<00:02:51.090> s<00:02:51.240> in

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now going to punch that program s in

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.400 
now going to punch that program s in
memory<00:02:52.080> onto<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.190> USB<00:02:53.610> disk<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:54.960> show<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
memory onto the USB disk I can show the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.970 
memory onto the USB disk I can show the
directory<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.670> disk<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.780> now<00:02:58.020> my<00:02:58.260> job<00:02:58.620> 1

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
dot txt is on that USB let's say I have

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.180 
dot txt is on that USB let's say I have
a<00:03:02.910> program<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.050> maybe<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.680> 50

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
a program here that maybe is 50

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.630 
a program here that maybe is 50
megabytes<00:03:05.730> 60<00:03:06.360> megabytes<00:03:06.720> 2<00:03:07.620> megabytes<00:03:08.250> that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
doesn't fit in the Fidel's memory and it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.150 
doesn't fit in the Fidel's memory and it
takes<00:03:11.550> too<00:03:11.730> long<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.120> load<00:03:12.270> into<00:03:12.570> memory<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:13.590> can

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
takes too long to load into memory I can

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.340 
takes too long to load into memory I can
just<00:03:14.340> run<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.700> off<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.970> USB<00:03:15.210> disk<00:03:15.660> there's<00:03:16.020> you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
just run it off to USB disk there's you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.800 
just run it off to USB disk there's you
can<00:03:16.530> run<00:03:16.740> small<00:03:17.130> program<00:03:17.760> large<00:03:18.150> programs

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
can run small program large programs

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.980 
can run small program large programs
basically<00:03:19.590> any<00:03:20.070> program<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.030> doesn't<00:03:21.810> have

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
basically any program that doesn't have
