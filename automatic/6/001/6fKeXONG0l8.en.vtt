the<00:02:24.870> infinities<00:02:25.290> I'm<00:02:25.620> gonna<00:02:25.740> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.490> a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the infinities I'm gonna going to make a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.330 
the infinities I'm gonna going to make a
look<00:02:26.670> super<00:02:27.060> cool<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.660> my<00:02:27.690> controller<00:02:28.340> just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
look super cool on my controller just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.270 
look super cool on my controller just
get<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> better<00:02:29.940> lighting<00:02:30.240> right<00:02:30.630> there<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
get up a better lighting right there and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040 
get up a better lighting right there and
obviously<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.270> shows<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.750> conic

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
obviously this it shows the conic

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.390 
obviously this it shows the conic
diversity<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.530> well<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.100> ps3

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
diversity as well because I have a ps3

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.100 
diversity as well because I have a ps3
stick<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> right<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> xbox<00:02:36.660> 360

stick on the right and I have a xbox 360

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.140 
stick on the right and I have a xbox 360
sick<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.350> my<00:02:37.410> left<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.700> stick<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.060> on

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
sick on my left so if you stick it on

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.440 
sick on my left so if you stick it on
there<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.540> hear<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.130> colic<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there you hear a kind of colic and that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
there you hear a kind of colic and that
stays<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:43.320> nicely<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.610> then<00:02:44.760> I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
stays on there very nicely and then I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.460 
stays on there very nicely and then I
was<00:02:45.000> seen<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> xbox<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.380> as

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
was seen you put it on the xbox one as

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.410 
was seen you put it on the xbox one as
well<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:49.520> FPS<00:02:50.520> freeks<00:02:51.090> on

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
well and you have your FPS freeks on

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.860 
well and you have your FPS freeks on
your<00:02:51.570> controller<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.570> basically<00:02:54.570> if<00:02:54.810> you

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
your controller and basically if you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.480 
your controller and basically if you
don't<00:02:55.020> know<00:02:55.080> FPS<00:02:55.380> freeks<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.800> they<00:02:56.160> basically

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
don't know FPS freeks do they basically

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.460 
don't know FPS freeks do they basically
raise<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> height<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> joystick<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.380> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
raise the height of the joystick so you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.170 
raise the height of the joystick so you
have<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.830> range<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.280> movement<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.850> first<00:03:00.060> of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
have more range of movement so first of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.600 
have more range of movement so first of
all<00:03:00.209> you've<00:03:01.050> you've<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.070> ability<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
all you've you've got the ability to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.460 
all you've you've got the ability to
basically<00:03:02.730> make<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.150> full<00:03:03.480> movement<00:03:03.780> using

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
basically make the full movement using

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.290 
basically make the full movement using
your<00:03:04.590> hand<00:03:04.740> using<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.310> full<00:03:05.490> finger<00:03:05.850> but

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
your hand using your full finger but

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.150 
your hand using your full finger but
also<00:03:06.630> because<00:03:06.990> it's<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.260> lot<00:03:07.380> higher<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
also because it's a lot higher the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.120 
also because it's a lot higher the
actual<00:03:08.910> kind<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.380> like<00:03:10.380> what's<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.950> word

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
actual kind of like what's the word

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.000 
actual kind of like what's the word
what's<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.430> word<00:03:11.490> what's<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.820> word<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
what's the word what's the word the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.580 
what's the word what's the word the
amount<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.550> move<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
amount that you have to move it is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.040 
amount that you have to move it is
doubled<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.120> over<00:03:18.240> for<00:03:18.510> me<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
doubled what it is it's over for me to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.990 
doubled what it is it's over for me to
take<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.320> one<00:03:19.380> off<00:03:19.530> for<00:03:19.980> instance<00:03:20.160> basically

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
take this one off for instance basically

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.699 
take this one off for instance basically
they<00:03:21.720> try<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:21.990> kick<00:03:22.170> move<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> little<00:03:22.500> bit

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
they try and kick move it a little bit

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.500 
they try and kick move it a little bit
you've<00:03:22.830> got<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> trunk<00:03:23.310> are<00:03:23.550> when<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.180> move<00:03:24.330> on

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
you've got a trunk are when you move on

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.360 
you've got a trunk are when you move on
these<00:03:24.660> ones<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.200> got<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.220> can

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
these ones you you got that like you can

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
these ones you you got that like you can
move<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.880> same<00:03:27.120> mark<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.720> one

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
move the same mark that one that one

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.040 
move the same mark that one that one
because<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.769> half<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.040> size<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
because that was half the size it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.990 
because that was half the size it
basically<00:03:31.050> doubles<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.400> amount<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.700> stuff

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
basically doubles the amount of stuff

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.880 
basically doubles the amount of stuff
like<00:03:33.300> movement<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.959> actually<00:03:34.080> do<00:03:34.410> so
