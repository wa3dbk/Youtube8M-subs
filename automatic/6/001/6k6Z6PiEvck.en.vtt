00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.930 

this<00:00:07.370> is<00:00:08.870> my<00:00:10.850> first

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
this is my first

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.609 
this is my first
full<00:00:13.179> after<00:00:13.780> like<00:00:13.959> six<00:00:14.349> attempts<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:16.480> making<00:00:17.320> a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
full after like six attempts of making a

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.990 
full after like six attempts of making a
real<00:00:18.990> engine<00:00:19.990> not<00:00:20.439> one<00:00:20.710> of<00:00:20.740> those<00:00:21.000> cheesy

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
real engine not one of those cheesy

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
real engine not one of those cheesy
oscillating<00:00:22.900> engines<00:00:23.349> but<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.950> a<00:00:23.980> real

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
oscillating engines but this is a real

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.550 
oscillating engines but this is a real
piston<00:00:25.539> engine<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.930> course<00:00:26.140> it<00:00:26.230> doesn't<00:00:26.380> use

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
piston engine of course it doesn't use

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.589 
piston engine of course it doesn't use
gas<00:00:26.800> line<00:00:27.070> he<00:00:27.189> uses<00:00:27.520> air<00:00:28.150> pressure<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.480> this

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
gas line he uses air pressure but this

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.190 
gas line he uses air pressure but this
is<00:00:31.750> my<00:00:31.899> first<00:00:32.230> successful<00:00:33.219> model<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.960> real

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
is my first successful model of a real

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.729 
is my first successful model of a real
working<00:00:35.469> engine<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:37.059> this<00:00:37.570> uses<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:41.430> 2<00:00:42.430> by<00:00:42.700> 2

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
working engine now this uses a 2 by 2

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
working engine now this uses a 2 by 2
brick<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.370> piston<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.710> look<00:00:50.859> here

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
brick or the piston if you look here

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
brick or the piston if you look here
this<00:00:52.449> is<00:00:52.749> the<00:00:52.929> key<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.679> making<00:00:54.429> a<00:00:54.850> good<00:00:55.329> engine

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this is the key to making a good engine

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.729 
this is the key to making a good engine
see<00:00:57.280> here<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.640> valve<00:01:01.019> just<00:01:02.019> made<00:01:02.260> out<00:01:02.620> of

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
see here is the valve just made out of

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.780 
see here is the valve just made out of
this<00:01:03.239> 2<00:01:04.239> by<00:01:04.420> 2<00:01:04.479> brick<00:01:04.900> with<00:01:05.110> two<00:01:05.320> holes<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:06.610> you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
this 2 by 2 brick with two holes if you

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.490 
this 2 by 2 brick with two holes if you
use<00:01:06.909> one<00:01:07.150> holds<00:01:07.540> fine<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:08.080> won't<00:01:08.320> be<00:01:08.409> as

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
use one holds fine it won't be as

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.710 
use one holds fine it won't be as
powerful<00:01:08.770> because<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.850> valve<00:01:10.300> won't<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.630> as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
powerful because the valve won't be as

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.750 
powerful because the valve won't be as
big<00:01:10.960> but<00:01:11.290> no<00:01:12.250> biggie<00:01:12.549> well<00:01:13.409> yeah<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.580> no

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
big but no biggie well yeah it is no

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.080 
big but no biggie well yeah it is no
biggie<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.220> valve<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.820> moves

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
biggie and then the valve that moves

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.130 
biggie and then the valve that moves
itself<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.280> same<00:01:21.550> thing<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.900> on<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
itself is the same thing and on the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.070 
itself is the same thing and on the
outside<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.280> same<00:01:24.520> thing<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.810> is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
outside is the same thing and this is

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.930 
outside is the same thing and this is
the<00:01:26.380> key<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:27.070> making<00:01:27.760> valve<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:33.430> my<00:01:33.760> other

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
the key to making valve so all my other

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.100 
the key to making valve so all my other
attempts<00:01:34.690> did<00:01:34.960> not<00:01:35.230> have<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.770> valve<00:01:36.130> type

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
attempts did not have this valve type

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.940 
attempts did not have this valve type
but<00:01:38.110> this<00:01:38.830> does<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.350> reason<00:01:41.560> why<00:01:41.890> it

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
but this does and the reason why it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.760 
but this does and the reason why it
works<00:01:42.370> is<00:01:42.670> because<00:01:42.960> each<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.290> blocks<00:01:44.380> is

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
works is because each of the blocks is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.820 
works is because each of the blocks is
the<00:01:44.890> same<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.460> therefore<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.800> blocks<00:01:49.650> do<00:01:50.650> not

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
the same and therefore the blocks do not

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.880 
the same and therefore the blocks do not
let<00:01:51.220> any<00:01:51.490> air<00:01:51.790> leak<00:01:52.630> through<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.290> valve<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
let any air leak through the valve and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.690 
let any air leak through the valve and
that<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.340> extremely<00:01:55.180> important<00:01:55.930> for<00:01:56.490> those<00:01:57.490> of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
that is extremely important for those of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.720 
that is extremely important for those of
you<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.000> I've<00:01:58.870> tried<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.500> failed<00:01:59.800> multiple

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
you that I've tried and failed multiple

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.720 
you that I've tried and failed multiple
times<00:02:01.180> like<00:02:01.750> me<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.220> stumbled<00:02:03.490> across

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
times like me then I stumbled across

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.540 
times like me then I stumbled across
this<00:02:04.150> little<00:02:05.880> engine<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.750> i<00:02:08.379> found<00:02:08.830> on<00:02:09.129> some

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
this little engine that i found on some

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.449 
this little engine that i found on some
website<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.239> saw<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.170> had<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.920> same<00:02:12.159> pieces

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
website and saw that had the same pieces

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.690 
website and saw that had the same pieces
throughout<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.959> what<00:02:16.959> made<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.620> work

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.740 

now<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.880> engine<00:02:22.390> moves<00:02:23.350> up<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.890> down<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:25.569> has

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
now this engine moves up and down it has

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.940 
now this engine moves up and down it has
a<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.840> call<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.050> think<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.560> bore

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
a what you call I think it's a bore

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.520 
a what you call I think it's a bore
three<00:02:30.610> bricks<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> valve<00:02:33.490> moves<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
three bricks and the valve moves up and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.320 
three bricks and the valve moves up and
down<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.959> half<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> half

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
down like half of that so one and a half

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070 
down like half of that so one and a half
how<00:02:40.660> did<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.990> know<00:02:41.350> how<00:02:41.590> much<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:43.480> one

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
how did I know how much it is like one

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.020 
how did I know how much it is like one
and<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.260> half<00:02:44.290> bricks<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:45.160> something<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.880> don't

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
and a half bricks or something I don't

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.630 
and a half bricks or something I don't
know<00:02:46.650> you'll<00:02:47.650> figure<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.950> out<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.370> build

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
know you'll figure it out when you build

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.540 
know you'll figure it out when you build
your<00:02:49.030> own<00:02:49.090> engine<00:02:49.569> so<00:02:50.080> see<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.069> can<00:02:51.250> get<00:02:51.370> this

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
your own engine so see if I can get this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.320 
your own engine so see if I can get this
thing<00:02:51.610> running<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.989> reminder<00:02:53.790> i'm<00:02:54.790> using

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
thing running just a reminder i'm using

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:05.310 
thing running just a reminder i'm using
a<00:02:56.459> high<00:02:57.459> power<00:02:58.230> shot<00:02:59.230> back<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:04.570> engine

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
a high power shot back and this engine

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.940 
a high power shot back and this engine
in<00:03:05.590> particular<00:03:07.260> requires<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.650> lot<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.610> pressure

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
in particular requires a lot of pressure

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.540 
in particular requires a lot of pressure
or<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> lot<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> lot<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.150> power<00:03:13.420> from<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.550> shop

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
or a lot like a lot of power from a shop

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.090 
or a lot like a lot of power from a shop
vac<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.870> too<00:03:17.080> much<00:03:17.230> power<00:03:17.530> they<00:03:17.920> might
