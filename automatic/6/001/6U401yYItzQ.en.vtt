00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.369 
I'm going to teach it to you in the
progression<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.640> song<00:02:16.879> each<00:02:17.450> chord<00:02:17.930> last

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
progression of the song each chord last

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.460 
progression of the song each chord last
one<00:02:18.800> measure<00:02:19.129> which<00:02:19.489> means<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:20.360> two<00:02:20.840> three

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
one measure which means one two three

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.070 
one measure which means one two three
four<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.849> every<00:02:23.209> chord<00:02:23.420> changes<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.050> that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
four so every chord changes for that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.680 
four so every chord changes for that
except<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.310> last<00:02:25.730> little

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
except for just the last little

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690 
except for just the last little
turnaround<00:02:27.319> before<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> whole<00:02:28.250> progression

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
turnaround before the whole progression

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.440 
turnaround before the whole progression
starts<00:02:28.970> over<00:02:29.210> here<00:02:29.240> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
starts over here and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.850 
starts over here and
it's<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.020> same<00:02:31.200> thing<00:02:31.230> over<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.770> over

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
it's just the same thing over and over

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's just the same thing over and over

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the root I'm going to put my middle

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.199 
the root I'm going to put my middle
finger<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.620> 7th<00:02:43.980> fret<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.000> bard

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
finger on the 7th fret and then I bard

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
E and the a string is muted so that's a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.699 
E and the a string is muted so that's a
pretty<00:02:51.569> strange<00:02:52.020> chord<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.410> you've<00:02:52.530> never

pretty strange chord if you've never
played<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.130> before<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.209> could<00:02:54.540> also<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
played it before so you could also do it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.500 
played it before so you could also do it
where<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> regular<00:02:55.800> bar<00:02:56.550> minor<00:02:57.120> Barre

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
where you take a regular bar minor Barre

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.150

and then followed by another next-door

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.560 
and then followed by another next-door
so<00:03:49.160> that's<00:03:49.310> another<00:03:49.520> part<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.880> happen<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.300> jazz

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
so that's another part to happen to jazz

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.930 
so that's another part to happen to jazz
a<00:03:50.600> lot<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.440> that's<00:03:51.890> called<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.430> circle<00:03:52.820> of

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
a lot that that's called the circle of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.660 
a lot that that's called the circle of
fourths<00:03:53.240> but<00:03:54.110> also<00:03:54.740> there's<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.640> know

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
fourths but also there's you know

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.490 
fourths but also there's you know
there's<00:03:56.120> little<00:03:56.600> things<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:56.930> happen<00:03:57.320> over

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
there's little things that happen over

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.320 
there's little things that happen over
and<00:03:57.740> over<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.100> it's<00:03:58.490> really<00:03:58.670> good<00:03:58.910> to

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
and over and it's really good to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.170 
and over and it's really good to
recognize<00:03:59.990> them<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.460> far<00:04:01.610> we<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.760> B<00:04:01.970> minor

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
recognize them so so far we have B minor

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.960 
recognize them so so far we have B minor
B<00:04:02.780> minor<00:04:02.810> 7<00:04:03.820> -<00:04:04.820> a<00:04:05.090> minor<00:04:05.420> 7

part of the circle of fourths which

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.520 
part of the circle of fourths which
basically<00:04:49.690> just<00:04:49.900> means<00:04:50.020> like<00:04:52.350> different<00:04:53.350> you

like an a minor shape and then but the

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.920 
like an a minor shape and then but the
root<00:05:32.440> is<00:05:32.770> on<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.190> E<00:05:33.220> string<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:34.330> same<00:05:34.570> fret<00:05:34.810> is

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
root is on the E string the same fret is

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.600 
root is on the E string the same fret is
the<00:05:34.960> middle<00:05:35.290> finger<00:05:35.590> that's<00:05:36.160> on<00:05:36.370> G<00:05:36.610> major<00:05:36.940> 7<00:05:38.610> so

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610
