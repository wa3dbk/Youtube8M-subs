00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
machine I don't think it don't a lot of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.369 
machine I don't think it don't a lot of
errors<00:00:50.030> because<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:51.390> oddly<00:00:51.780> anywhere<00:00:52.140> in

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
errors because there's oddly anywhere in

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
anything and what so much luck 3/6 4/6 I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.520 
anything and what so much luck 3/6 4/6 I
think<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> could<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.280> genuine<00:01:03.199> if<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.379> look

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
think that could be genuine if you look

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
think that could be genuine if you look
on<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> clutch<00:01:06.049> he's<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.260> worn<00:01:07.970> look<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
on the clutch he's not worn look at the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
on the clutch he's not worn look at the
brakes<00:01:09.450> they're<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> particularly<00:01:10.920> worn<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I think with the farm and louder on it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730 
I think with the farm and louder on it's
only<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.729> job<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.740> there

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
