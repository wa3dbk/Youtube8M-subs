00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.570
 first of all many times for the video 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.930
 and I hope it serves you something 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.989
 in this one this occasion we continue with the game was in the fantasy 13 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.340
 and we will explain 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.880
 the simplest and fastest way to obtain dark matter 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.529
 this material the dark matter 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.710
 although it is also a rare object not so rare as what it costs up 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 tomato of growing weight in gold 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.699
 but he was worried 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.529
 I put the top floor 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.430
 dark matter is also a rare object and it is an object that we do need 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.210
 for 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.310
 5 more objects 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.030
 this catalyst is not repaired elevated last level 5 gestures 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.230
 one of them is a weapon the weapon of saas 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 and others and the other four are subject to accessories 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.450
 it's good we are in total five more than the priests compete in five subjects 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.650
 cure if it is enough or need more 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.550
 at least for the objects 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.690
 queserÃ­a vanidad de caraquiz wants to have more than five healing materials but 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 with five is enough 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.370
 let's see what we need 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 and where are we going to do it? 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.810
 the first thing that the team needs 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 the formation piles two characters that we have used 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.440
 we will use eagerness as a leader 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.250
 and hazaras and go a thousand 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 as members 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.230
 the training is that we are going to use are the following 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.650
 the first victim is the one we're always going to start the battle with is the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.030
 big Wall 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 we will have assured synergy in the network cerberus de phoenix 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 cyzone formations the great wall is protective 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.300
 protective 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.060
 protective 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 ashura is business with everything 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.440
 or sector 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 the synergy is inspiring 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.369
 inspired 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.730
 shooter 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.590
 the coven examiner 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.479
 culminated 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.490
 I like 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.149
 Luis Smith is punished 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.740
 punished punished 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 and the phoenix the savior save healed 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.040
 simple and easy 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.070
 but we do need these three people to be 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.220
 that is very important that they are three 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.329
 especially by the skills of both the fans and the sas sector 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.039
 and because 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.359
 valid is one of the best scorers in the game 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.909
 together with fox but jobs does not have the weapon that I'm going to show you company 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.469
 let's go to the team 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.629
 we started with fanta 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.599
 what we need is in the first place the venus either the venus or the spear of 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.639
 what in 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.519
 created from the venus because we see it the effect it has is to prevent 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.059
 the carrier another of the enemy 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.510
 Perez even if he's already on the verge of being stunned as long as they pay 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.220
 Peron Cape makes his first covering lawyer 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.429
 that we have left 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.669
 very good margin of the year 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.229
 On the other hand, we need errant loot 2 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.059
 and the wise choice 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.639
 along with kipling bags 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.179
 the bases derek yee the red boots and the wise lesson the english guys 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.510
 to do a lot of damage not having it or two to hit very much appreciated 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.510
 the selection so that the Basque budgets 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.510
 the subjects then 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.360
 the contrast if we are in the pp the bus 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.879
 or his final soul final shuarma 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.709
 evolved from these 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.239
 because what you do wrong is increase the duration of the stun 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.119
 enemy and very facts 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.009
 very essential with television news out brewing forests granting dure 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:20.709
 a lot because the enemy is very powerful then the more we can make a 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.949
 the best daze for us 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.779
 also as we quote the side ankle boots are granted to do 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:27.620
 a lot of damage 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.399
 and in a short time 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.029
 on the other hand company inc 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.579
 we need nirvana 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.619
 daniel go to created from his malboro gun 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.919
 because the effect that will have to be more increases the probability of success 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.900
 of impairment skills 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.900
 so that it's much faster than cale weakens our enemies 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.650
 also has how you can see the luck of that in which the booties awards 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.189
 in that direction 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.699
 abc action of these objects that these weapons that I just mentioned what 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.850
 want equipped after marquez apart from that is 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.399
 question of you 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.429
 there is nothing demanding 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.769
 That is what we need 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.900
 those are the formations that we need and the weapons and objects that 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.799
 we need 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.890
 obviously 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 and this I do want them to emit on it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.649
 this method is being used 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.170
 at the end of the game 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.999
 and when all our characters 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:21.819
 already in the maximum level of your cd roles of the followers that are better 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:26.629
 when they are already at the maximum of the facts we answer them using these 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.440
 because if we do it before it's going to be very difficult and it's going to be a battle 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.370
 extremely complicated 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.370
 not to say it is 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.370
 impossible to 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.000
 as you can see now us by mall is bad maximum level of your five 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.690
 goals of his fierce forgiveness 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.110
 level 5 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.900
 we'll see 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.010
 now let me introduce you to the little person we are going to go with 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 Ours are authentic 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.620
 once we finish 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.750
 missions 7 from 1 to 63 and especially to 63 you have 64 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.800
 millions 7 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.870
 sending a writing to the pulse cam the enemies known as the blanket and 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.710
 And nothing more than that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.710
 will be replaced by two others even more 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.139
 powerful 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.300
 the fairy blanket and other studies by the lonko today 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.610
 the proud of the most powerful enemy of the whole game is the hardest one of 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.610
 to overcome but this way they get into problems he is not the one that interests us 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.409
 On the other hand, the lady who is going to be replaced by throwing a goal is a 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.799
 enemy a little bit weaker than on Sunday and but good for me has a 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:37.089
 complexity 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.719
 interesting phuket 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.159
 then now a buick 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.270
 is the enemy we are going to go against 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.060
 as you can see the booties that is not only the purchase 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.369
 they are either a gold nugget with a cure mateos both do not look much because 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:54.439
 because the gold nugget can be sold at a very good price in stores and 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.039
 good dark matter is why we're going to go 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.499
 that's why he's a potentate, that's why we equip the mets team that 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.690
 show time remembered that we request 5 dark matter 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.929
 it is essential that they do it this way because mobile 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.889
 I strongly suggest you do it this way 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.659
 because getting dark matter is faster 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.300
 because if they want to buy it in stores the dark matter each 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.639
 it costs 840 thousand kilos 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.559
 If we need five, the father tells him about the best 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:25.800
 with this method 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.119
 we are all going to see 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.119
 the place where signs are made 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.380
 in the central planes as it is in the main frame of great pulse 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.219
 the largest of them is at this point on the map 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.379
 I'm happy a little bit on a motorcycle back then 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:43.650
 as you can see 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.410
 down to the right is because we arrived that place came in the first place where 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.690
 we come to campus 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.770
 and that's where the fight that promises Bosnian must agree 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:56.989
 the thing is to get this point on the map to this save point 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.119
 once we have already identified the place 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:04.119
 let's proceed to attack our friend 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.479
 wing is I want from the save point is where are we going to have we started to 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.479
 walk to the right show some small hills 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:17.249
 and well let's go up the hill 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.710
 another jump 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.730
 and it is that we have arrived with our 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.069
 friend he 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.229
 longo and 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.229
 with the lack of control with which we are going to fight 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:32.199
 I remind you that we are starting the battle with the formation 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:34.809
 the big Wall 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:37.520
 what is protective for ourselves 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.520
 let's start the battle 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.650
 The first thing we have to do is defend ourselves because their first life since 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.499
 quake 

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.379
 and the earthquake is one the biotechnology is a lot 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.379
 one is that apply the earthquake we passed directly ashura 

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:54.689
 builder 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:57.889
 my fans the first thing to do is apply brake 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.719
 van lonkhuyzen only brake brake brake brake until you give me 

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:04.719
 once Ferrari is applied to how it is still applied 

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:07.490
 saddest 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.599
 state 

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:13.610
 malignant for him once they're all let's go into the slip 

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.879
 the act closed on 

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.229
 the state that prevented him
