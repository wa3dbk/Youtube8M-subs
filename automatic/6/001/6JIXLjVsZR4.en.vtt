00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.490
 welcome leost phone 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.889
 s930 i'm going to flash it here 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 Chinese firmware you see even hieroglyphs 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 in places 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 there are all sorts of zigzags 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 all hieroglyphs are going to change 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.289
 firmware on European but before 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.539
 change the firmware in order to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.369
 to err on the safe side because 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.230
 that if something goes wrong you can 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 ditch such a small little 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 an area of ​​memory called enver 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.770
 than this area how remarkable it is 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 probably the most important area in all 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 phone in this area are stored and mine 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 numbers are stored mac-addresses 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 but the bluetooth settings that is it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 such unique data which is not on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.399
 other phones then there is a phone with 2 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.050
 the phone held to the mac address and my 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.949
 the address does not exist more precisely and we 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 No. Well, I'll start it all further. 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.820
 i will show you how to save it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.309
 content of figs on your computer 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.739
 so if something goes wrong you could 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 easy to write it back it is very 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 convenient and very cool you will save 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.500
 huge amount of time and very 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 a lot of nerves 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 but before I start doing this I want 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.189
 say i will show how i do it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.840
 if you will repeat something you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.520
 will repeat at your own risk I 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.130
 not responsible for 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.659
 phone you killed and so us 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 will need to merge here 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.710
 this important courtyards we need 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.540
 Directly phone and usb cable 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.049
 which was complete computer and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.759
 Some files that I downloaded from 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.509
 offline lenovo forum dot rub for what 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.500
 thank you very much guys 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.290
 they are our files 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 You can download these files by the link. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 which will be in the description under this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 video that is, I specifically put everything 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.079
 collected so long did not look for 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.040
 so we need first we need 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.040
 connect phone 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.299
 then we need to switch to mode 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.460
 usb debugging 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.990
 now he will translate from me but if he 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.880
 you would not have a translate issue 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.160
 press this item and directly 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.849
 introduces it into usb debug mode 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.750
 while in your control panel 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.130
 device manager must decide 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.260
 a device called lenovo and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.599
 debi device if you have lenovo 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.550
 s 600 blah blah blah this means that you have 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.620
 not installed drive you need this one 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.660
 Now the driver from the archive here this here 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.000
 big driver that has size 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 almost 10 megabytes ie this is a toy you 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.860
 run it is set later 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.319
 turn off turn on again from big both and 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.810
 you have already decided how lenovo and baby 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.269
 interface all sorted out drivers 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.920
 we go further we need a program with 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.310
 by which we will merge here 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:59.500
 this slave called mtk droid 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:02.390
 ace let's unpack right away 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.130
 we run it self-extracting 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.540
 archive 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.100
 that is, the program itself does not require 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.450
 installation for an hour just here 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:16.640
 unpacked with us here it is daddy 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.870
 we start the executable in the seven we start 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.400
 as administrator 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.010
 not this whole thing found the 64-bit system 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.780
 a little bit the case now loudly started 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:35.300
 he exchanges with the phone in order 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:37.370
 to get the data she needs all all 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.170
 we have all well connected program 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.630
 Ruth says that it is possible but we have to 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.800
 In principle, I believe that we do not need here. 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.310
 need this button which 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:52.100
 called and we either enver 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:54.770
 push it so legs and wrong yet 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.950
 need need root privileges how to get root 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.260
 I showed the rights in one video in the series 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.760
 by phone lenovo s930 all references 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.950
 there is in the description under the video so 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.870
 come see first get them 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.020
 root rights then got root-rights 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.700
 but keep on watching tolik I already 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.590
 here got the root of the program 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.180
 says that you can connect via 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.989
 superuser and root, click Root 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.989
 now we have established 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.370
 all root rights are continue that is 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.800
 All these items are already actively making sure that 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.800
 there are ticks and click backup 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.830
 if you had this content died 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.080
 memory you would click here to make sure 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.920
 are these checkmark and set not used 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.590
 to restore and that is well and would choose 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.020
 file and so i clicked bk 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.870
 and I have something here in the log 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.750
 It was registered that I now have this 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.610
 here is daddy enrolled here these are given 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.370
 let me delete them again so that 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.220
 make sure that they signed up 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.930
 there is now everything is empty let's again 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.390
 go press backup here is one file 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.760
 registered and here is the second registered in 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.290
 as a result, we have two files with a total size 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.900
 about 6 megabytes 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.960
 which is a lot of disk space you have not 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.090
 will take but that will be very 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.280
 by the way if you flood the cult wrong 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.170
 the firmware is either the wrong scatter file and you 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.000
 The firmware will overwrite something there 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.890
 exactly fall into the area of ​​the yard 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.020
 you are very easy and quick all 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.930
 restore otherwise you will have to 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.940
 I'll have to help you a little bit 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.920
 strongly frighten that it is impossible further 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.050
 nothing to do or you will kill forever 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.480
 phone but just have a little bit 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.910
 to suffer to restore it but in 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.280
 principle and everything and in the next video I already 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.710
 show directly flashing itself 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.940
 this phone on any firmware 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.940
 which you have
