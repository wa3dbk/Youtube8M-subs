that<00:04:03.639> was<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.819> good<00:04:04.090> idea<00:04:04.239> in<00:04:04.510> my<00:04:04.750> part<00:04:05.079> but<00:04:06.010> as

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
that was a good idea in my part but as

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.710 
that was a good idea in my part but as
always<00:04:06.459> get<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.819> little<00:04:07.060> bit<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.209> wiper<00:04:07.389> play

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
always get a little bit of wiper play

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.569 
always get a little bit of wiper play
taste<00:04:08.349> this<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.769> right<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.370> worn

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
taste this that right there it's worn

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.440 
taste this that right there it's worn
out<00:04:09.760> but<00:04:10.750> uh<00:04:11.250> yeah<00:04:12.250> I'm<00:04:12.519> still<00:04:12.819> think<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.299> can

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
out but uh yeah I'm still think I can

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.210 
out but uh yeah I'm still think I can
get<00:04:13.569> this<00:04:13.690> down<00:04:13.930> lower<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.620> might<00:04:14.859> not<00:04:15.010> play

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
get this down lower but I might not play

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.460 
get this down lower but I might not play
with<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.579> so<00:04:16.329> what's<00:04:16.539> too<00:04:16.720> low<00:04:16.959> then<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.320> get

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
with it so what's too low then you get

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.939 
with it so what's too low then you get
too<00:04:17.680> high<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:19.060> is<00:04:19.479> pretty<00:04:19.840> close<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.680> was

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
too high this is pretty close I was

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.120 
too high this is pretty close I was
comparing<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.930> other<00:04:22.930> trucks

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.950 
it makes it look like it's some smaller
dimension<00:04:38.830> from<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.370> here

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
dimension from there to here

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.680 
dimension from there to here
that's<00:04:40.960> his<00:04:41.140> maximum<00:04:41.680> height<00:04:41.920> over<00:04:42.340> there<00:04:42.690> and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
that's his maximum height over there and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.930 
that's his maximum height over there and
this<00:04:44.260> was<00:04:44.500> too<00:04:44.710> low<00:04:44.950> with<00:04:45.340> banging<00:04:45.760> on<00:04:45.820> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
this was too low with banging on the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
this was too low with banging on the
plastic<00:04:46.500> bow-bow-bow<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:49.570> possessed

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
plastic bow-bow-bow and that possessed

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.760 
plastic bow-bow-bow and that possessed
touch<00:04:50.650> too<00:04:50.920> high<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.900> was<00:04:53.290> so<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> can't

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
touch too high and that was so I can't

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.260 
touch too high and that was so I can't
even<00:04:53.830> come<00:04:54.130> down<00:04:54.310> on<00:04:54.520> this<00:04:54.610> driver's<00:04:55.030> side<00:04:55.210> a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
even come down on this driver's side a

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.300 
even come down on this driver's side a
little<00:04:55.570> bit<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.810> think<00:04:56.050> I'll<00:04:56.350> probably<00:04:56.530> be<00:04:56.830> good

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
little bit I think I'll probably be good

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.610 
little bit I think I'll probably be good
I<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.390> driver's<00:04:58.780> side<00:04:58.960> still<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> little

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
I think the driver's side still a little

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.960 
I think the driver's side still a little
too<00:04:59.740> high<00:05:00.660> but<00:05:01.660> Ted<00:05:02.400> I'm<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:03.550> going<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.760> knock

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
too high but Ted I'm just going to knock

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.020 
too high but Ted I'm just going to knock
this<00:05:04.150> down<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.920> that's<00:05:06.100> it<00:05:06.430> throw<00:05:06.820> some

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
this down and that's it throw some

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.260 
this down and that's it throw some
grease<00:05:07.270> on<00:05:07.450> there<00:05:07.690> again<00:05:09.060> cleanable<00:05:10.060> this

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
grease on there again cleanable this

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.400 
grease on there again cleanable this
stuff<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:11.440> eat<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.670> just<00:05:13.630> adjusted

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
stuff is eat I just adjusted

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.230 
stuff is eat I just adjusted
both<00:05:14.590> sides<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.400> think<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.760> passenger

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
both sides and I think the passenger

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.390 
both sides and I think the passenger
side<00:05:16.420> is<00:05:16.570> low<00:05:16.750> now<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.380> he's<00:05:17.710> got<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.070> keep<00:05:18.190> on

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
side is low now so he's got to keep on

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.420 
side is low now so he's got to keep on
doing<00:05:18.640> this<00:05:19.410> back<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.590> forth<00:05:20.650> you'll<00:05:21.160> get<00:05:21.340> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
doing this back and forth you'll get it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.550 
doing this back and forth you'll get it
right<00:05:21.580> eventually<00:05:21.840> fun<00:05:22.840> job<00:05:23.110> though<00:05:23.350> if<00:05:23.470> you

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
right eventually fun job though if you

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.770 
right eventually fun job though if you
get<00:05:23.680> your<00:05:23.770> wiper<00:05:23.950> arms<00:05:24.310> like<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:24.670> easy<00:05:25.090> fix

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
I hope that the wiper arm does not hit a

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.940 
I hope that the wiper arm does not hit a
cowl<00:05:36.400> piece<00:05:36.700> on<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.030> passenger<00:05:37.450> side<00:05:37.830> get<00:05:38.830> it

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
nothing wrong with it but uh that is

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.560 
nothing wrong with it but uh that is
also<00:06:34.330> a<00:06:34.510> problem<00:06:35.910> could<00:06:36.910> be<00:06:36.940> a<00:06:37.120> problem<00:06:37.510> and

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
also a problem could be a problem and

also a problem could be a problem and
yeah<00:06:40.570> that<00:06:40.870> would<00:06:41.020> also<00:06:41.169> make<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:42.060> wiper

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
yeah that would also make the wiper

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.120 
yeah that would also make the wiper
motor<00:06:43.270> not<00:06:43.720> return<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.320> why<00:06:44.500> is<00:06:44.560> this<00:06:44.770> hole<00:06:44.979> is
