00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello my friends today we will speak uniform movement say contest 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.750
 is in a timely manner could determine if the remaining spaces below 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.800
 in equal times this is that figure that can describe the moment of form 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 the uniform motion mathematically it can express itself 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.949
 by that mathematical expression that goal is more decisive than lying the final position 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 from the club to the starting position plus the speed turn the pivot 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.230
 the main characteristic of the movement informed what would be of the equal pieces 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.949
 in equal times we say that it has its constant velocity 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.959
 another way of writing this mathematical expression that was called 

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:44.079
 of position function is to place this CW with the left 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.230
 I played the part that he gave me, I have here in that position - the 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.960
 would be final position - initial position 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.719
 this is the so-called delta is position separation so we can also 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 write the same expression differently 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.670
 delta s is the speed time the time now would like to draw the graph of the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.160
 movement in position and velocity 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.270
 betray this we have to take this mathematical expression and transfer them 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.640
 for the graph that comes next, I have here the final position in the same 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.370
 starting position more speed same time so this is an action between the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.829
 position and time in the position time function is a linear air relation 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.469
 if there is a linear relationship 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.689
 see only I can say that the chart position over time has to be a 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.819
 straight relationship released the first grade function obligatorily 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.390
 I'm talking about a network, just look, I just have this line can be 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:46.639
 growing or it may be decreasing the goal is increasing I say that the 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.659
 positive speed is reattached and increasing hatred that speed is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.569
 negative speed is positive is the case of the year ahead we say that 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.810
 the movement is progressive negative speed is the car walking backwards 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.409
 People say that the movement is too beautiful retrograde we can calculate here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.590
 through this year we can only calculate the speed value in a 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.289
 sp graphic speed is given by the tangent closely 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.699
 when this velocity is positive in all but the tangent of that angle has the 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.899
 to see with our speed is negative and to finish but we can still 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:26.719
 Late Graphic Speed ​​The Time But Remember Friends The Even Motion A 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.929
 mobile walks like pieces in equal times so we say that he walks 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:36.539
 with constant velocity the vtv plot has velocity as a function of time 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.959
 I can say then that is a constant line so here we have David the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.579
 Victor graph for a positive speed and here the ipi graph for 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.409
 a negative velocity to close the last detail of the graph 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.230
 steam 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.579
 we can calculate 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.939
 the space traveled by the mode making the area the area that goes from the function until 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.499
 a month the planted area of ​​yellow then we say that it is domenicali in 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.559
 tibau to the space traveled, the cidh delegation asked today for a 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.939
 hugs and six of all good
