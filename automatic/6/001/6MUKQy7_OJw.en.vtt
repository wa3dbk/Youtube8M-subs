00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.490
 you represent nothing asked there was a strong adhesion of the coins of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.079
 researchers to create an overbid 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.079
 Let's go 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.259
 the belts I had them 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.299
 4 bizet carmen marked by a great option on the internet 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.879
 and so that I was in the pictures on a beach marquet worry about 

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.619
 the pictures and then then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 but what would have been seen to something else after another 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.399
 a belt at home 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.530
 in fact too much at what price I can not go anymore 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.960
 to accentuate 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 Thierry Henry 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.680
 after 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.370
 if m 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.550
 currently 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 the guides 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 two others 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 aiio is the union syna 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.060
 so 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.770
 she entered there 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.150
 the cairo the belts like all the prints 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.479
 dunkirk then you say yes cut out 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 first we knew them from the Corsican maquis 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.400
 m in Paris 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 brad pitt child I think that's it 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.980
 in the art of paper when looking like 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.060
 and you are curious 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.750
 the Japanese recognized both on the chains 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.510
 first mentioning you cutting out of the college network showed that the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.760
 censorship on 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.450
 the package what conceives 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 delphine trade in turin and all the tour 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.080
 and then it comes out and plastic 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 this prostitute 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.820
 it only hurts itself is the lava 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.920
 sacred of justice in a party 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.999
 khider which is detachable and so after that gives that the result 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 finally to fear and this year's chart a little belt 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.070
 for the continuation of an overtaking 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 these raids on a particular segment that of the poor country 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.239
 I try not to be too 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.909
 so here and then after 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.829
 but precisely because they have not had for thirty years 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.829
 there are per cent pressure menus or the task 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.570
 to turn 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.909
 look at it that way 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.169
 you will love my impression that depression or shelter over a week 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.959
 to prevent that if it's not simple 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.319
 it's like that 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.499
 the two plastic friends in the audience 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.749
 the oac that of the united states extracted 2 but the senate 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.059
 so 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.239
 I believe that here 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.129
 bourgoin 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.749

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:44.389
