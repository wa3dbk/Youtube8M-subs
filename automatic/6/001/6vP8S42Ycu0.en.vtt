00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.399
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.549
 new video and at the beginning of a series 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.129
 mythical of my channel gentlemen returns the 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.480
 root to glory and good those who follow me 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.730
 you've known for a long time that in fifa 12 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.270
 It was one of the series that I enjoyed the most 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.760
 doing and I know that you 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.100
 you also liked to see her so nothing 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.080
 logically in this type 13 had to 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.030
 do this series again many me what 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.700
 you have asked and I believe that it is already 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.830
 moment for which I am relatively 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.530
 new in the channel explain a little about 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.839
 concept of rock your glory or like me 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.140
 I like doing it, I'm giving birth to a new 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:42.679
 account of a timer team that is from zero 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.120
 no coin without matches played nothing and 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.069
 good from the initiation envelope 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.800
 that is usually a real garbage and a 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.229
 team ecompetration disaster 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.510
 I try to win or play at least 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.870
 some matches with that template to 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.780
 win some coins and go to sign up 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.319
 bronze players and try to form a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.950
 more or less decent bronze equipment 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:09.230
 win the bronze cup 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.380
 completed this step we would move to 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.720
 richard silvers up to get a team 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.600
 good silver and win the silver cup 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.280
 and the same thing we would do with the golds 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.290
 then you know well that last year 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.060
 we discovered real gems in this 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.020
 series accordaros of the mythical gabás the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 gabás of the bronze team then I removed 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.550
 the beast on the silver team and nothing 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 we ended up with a gold team of 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.850
 Belgian players quite competitive and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.620
 well this year the operation is going to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.860
 be similar the only thing that we're going to 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.810
 focus on the bbva league for this is because 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.080
 what I have not yet made any 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.380
 team of the league bbva and league forward 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.330
 I was delaying it until now 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.740
 and well, we'll start with a team 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.390
 bronze of the league forward then 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.010
 we will go to the silver one and then finally 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.650
 we will finish with a gold team that 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.890
 We will try to make it competitive 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.360
 and well nothing this is the label and that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.390
 I want to do this year you know that the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.480
 seasonal concept is maybe 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.740
 because it harms the functioning of the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 series because last year there were the 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.180
 fast matches and good you went with 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.640
 any template that they matched by 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.319
 level and ready but good we will try 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.170
 do it this year a bit on horseback between 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.150
 the divisions and the tournaments 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.959
 and as you see calling the envelope of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.880
 initiation and this is what I get a 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.910
 team what 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.820
 not with penetrates anywhere any link 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.850
 red maybe you can changing some 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.140
 players improve a bit but it's not 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.450
 a lot what we're going to get out of this 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.480
 team maybe one of the best 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.300
 players be that second forward peak 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 Italian what I've already played there 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.070
 seen in some bronze envelope and good 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.380
 guys from this template 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.230
 we will try what is said to gain some 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.500
 coins to make us a team of 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.340
 bronze a little decent and we'll enter 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.010
 to the bronze tournament to give cane 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.650
 and nothing guys this is the label of this 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.420
 year I hope you enjoy this series 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.750
 tell me in the comments any 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.790
 doubt suggestion or whatever and see you 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.790
