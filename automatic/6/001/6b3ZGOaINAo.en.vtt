00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.720
 most common genetic diseases 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.550
 there are thousands of diseases that affect 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.989
 the human organism and some of these 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.970
 diseases arise with the cause 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.550
 common and at the same time intensely 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.029
 influential people are devoid of 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.039
 heredity because of the existence of 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.779
 genetic load each person is 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.790
 predisposed to the possibility of 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.550
 develop an illness that parents 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.949
 may have acquired or even another 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.230
 relative to diseases 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.390
 genetically acquired are listed 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.250
 is approximately 6 thousand already recognized 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.480
 even with the presence of our genes and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 percent chance of a person 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.859
 develop any disease 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.539
 moreover, the appearance is also 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.039
 associated with the lifestyle that each 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.410
 person owns 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.420
 thus genetics only 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.210
 establishes the predisposition and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.130
 necessarily appearance of the disease 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 the most common genetic diseases are 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.590
 classified in 12 genes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 are caused by the change in the generation of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 dna of a single gene examples anemia 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.509
 sickle cell causes mass formation 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.040
 which ended up in the form of sickle 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:31.500
 respectively, the expectation 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.330
 of life and wolf affects you more 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.149
 frequency of men causing disorder 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.369
 the blood clotting mechanism the 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.070
 which causes intramuscular hemorrhages 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 and in private until lesions appear 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.050
 chromosomal bone changes 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.940
 numerical values ​​of the set of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 promotions of an individual examples 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.630
 Down syndrome is a genetic disorder 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.659
 which is due to the presence of a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 partial or total chromosome 21 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 influence mental retardation causing 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.390
 cognitive deficits difference in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.230
 height and body frame was 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.019
 only affects individuals of the genus 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.269
 that when adults present 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.130
 short stature genitals do not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.950
 develop by keeping the ovaries 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:29.070
 atrophied disconsolate and retardation 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.519
 multifactorial disorders are caused by 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.760
 a combination of genetic mutation 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.849
 examples 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.220
 diabetes lacking insulin absorption 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.870
 hormone produced by the pancreas which has 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 the function of transforming the molecules of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.750
 glucose in energy 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.420
 alzayani causes relentless and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.300
 progressive deterioration of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.650
 reason memory hypertension and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.660
 better known as high blood pressure 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.430
 to make the blood make the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.170
 walls of the arteries to achieve 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.180
 circulate throughout the body 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.299
 unifying the arteries and from there

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.260
 between diseases can still arise 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.620

 caused by the protozoan toxoplasma 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.180
 gondii which can cause serious damage to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.010
 my position and the muscles and rubella 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.849
