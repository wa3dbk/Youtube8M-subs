cables and for internet and stuff but
particularly<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.100> amalgamating<00:00:20.699> tape<00:00:20.910> it's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
particularly the amalgamating tape it's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
particularly the amalgamating tape it's
very<00:00:22.080> very<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.980> has<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> sole<00:00:23.550> purpose

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
very very good and it has a sole purpose

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
very very good and it has a sole purpose
which<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:24.930> an<00:00:25.230> outdoor<00:00:25.529> connectors

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
which is to make an outdoor connectors

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.580 
which is to make an outdoor connectors
waterproof<00:00:26.820> okay<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.320> typical

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
waterproof okay now a very typical

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.130 
waterproof okay now a very typical
example<00:00:29.250> where<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.150> would<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
example where we use this would be in

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
example where we use this would be in
the<00:00:31.199> example<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> cable<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.730> running

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the example of where a cable is running

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.709 
the example of where a cable is running
to<00:00:33.420> connect<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.260> an<00:00:34.559> lnb

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
to connect on to an lnb

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.540 
to connect on to an lnb
and<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.620> his<00:00:37.739> sky<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.340> like

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and so if we see his sky is that like

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
and so if we see his sky is that like
this<00:00:38.730> year<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.450> alum<00:00:39.690> bead<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> tip

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this year we have an alum bead of a tip

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.380 
this year we have an alum bead of a tip
on<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.820> Dinah's<00:00:42.270> would

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
on like this I would have Dinah's would

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
on like this I would have Dinah's would
have<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> cable<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> would<00:00:43.170> run<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.190> end

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
have a cable that would run from the end

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
have a cable that would run from the end
of<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.640> LMB<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.559> satellite<00:00:47.070> receiver<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
of that LMB into a satellite receiver in

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
of that LMB into a satellite receiver in
your<00:00:47.610> living<00:00:47.940> room<00:00:47.969> okay<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.500> for

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
take the LV off the dish and I have a
cable<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.329> made<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
cable here that I have made up and it's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
cable here that I have made up and it's

I'll do is I just rotate this around and
we<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.330> we've<00:01:06.450> got<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.750> joint<00:01:06.990> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
we see here we've got a good joint but

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
we see here we've got a good joint but
the<00:01:08.100> product<00:01:09.000> problem<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the product problem is that it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
the product problem is that it's
possible<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> water<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.510> managed<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> make

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
possible that water we managed to make

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.460 
possible that water we managed to make
its<00:01:13.350> way<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.799> between<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.570> treading<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
its way in between the treading here and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
its way in between the treading here and
the<00:01:16.590> connector<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.610> happen<00:01:17.880> over

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the connector and what will happen over

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.969 
the connector and what will happen over
a<00:01:18.119> period<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.540> time<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.590> rainy

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
a period of time is that in rainy

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
a period of time is that in rainy
weather<00:01:20.130> water<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> here

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
weather water will get in here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
weather water will get in here
it'll<00:01:22.530> short<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.119> core<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.420> air

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it'll short out the core and the air

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
it'll short out the core and the air
wires<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.350> lose<00:01:25.590> television<00:01:26.189> reception<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
wires you lose television reception and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
wires you lose television reception and
then<00:01:27.030> it'll<00:01:27.180> dry<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> normally<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
then it'll dry out so it normally and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
then it'll dry out so it normally and
transpires<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.630> information<00:01:31.079> problem

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
transpires as an information problem

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.800 
transpires as an information problem
okay<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.610> sometimes<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.570> certain

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.190 
always used by professional satellite
and<00:01:44.490> sellers<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> roll

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and sellers so we have here is a roll

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
and sellers so we have here is a roll
and<00:01:46.799> we'd<00:01:46.920> simply<00:01:47.070> roll<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.909> certain

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and we'd simply roll out a certain

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
and we'd simply roll out a certain
length<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.079> something<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
length and would use something like this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.179 
length and would use something like this
excuse<00:01:50.579> me<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.360> set<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> snips<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.100> if

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
excuse me and set of snips here so if

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
excuse me and set of snips here so if
you<00:01:53.280> cut<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> length<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.299> need<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:55.020> snip

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you cut the length that we need it snip

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
you cut the length that we need it snip
it<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.549> need<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it like this and what we do need to do

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
it like this and what we do need to do
then<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> need<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.840> nails<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
then is you need to get your nails in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
then is you need to get your nails in
between<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.210> pull<00:02:00.450> apart<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.939> strip

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
between and you pull apart and the strip

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
between and you pull apart and the strip
at<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> front<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.439> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
at the back and the front here just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.960 
at the back and the front here just
through<00:02:05.549> status<00:02:06.000> again<00:02:07.009> we<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.459> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
through status again we have it here so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.550 
through status again we have it here so
this<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.539> took<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> finger<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.229> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
this actually took a finger now this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
this actually took a finger now this
doesn't<00:02:10.770> feel<00:02:11.190> overly

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
doesn't feel overly

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.750 
doesn't feel overly
but<00:02:13.600> what<00:02:13.840> happens<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.460> do<00:02:15.580> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
but what happens is that what we do is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.820 
but what happens is that what we do is
we'll<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.080> parrot<00:02:17.410> that's<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
we'll get that the parrot that's just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.710 
we'll get that the parrot that's just
been<00:02:17.980> exposed<00:02:18.310> now<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.240> wrap<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.630> around

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
been exposed now and we wrap it around

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.000 
been exposed now and we wrap it around
the<00:02:20.680> LMB<00:02:21.480> let<00:02:22.480> me<00:02:22.570> hold<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.080> let<00:02:23.680> me<00:02:23.800> wrap<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the LMB let me hold it let me wrap it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.420 
the LMB let me hold it let me wrap it
again<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:25.210> around<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.770> what<00:02:26.890> happens<00:02:27.250> is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
again and around and what happens is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.390 
again and around and what happens is
that<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.970> sets<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.890> becomes<00:02:30.160> extremely

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
that this sets and it becomes extremely

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.730 
that this sets and it becomes extremely
tight<00:02:31.000> what<00:02:31.840> actually<00:02:32.260> happened<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.590> now

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
tight what actually happened is now

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
tight what actually happened is now
normally<00:02:33.130> would<00:02:33.250> use<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> longer<00:02:34.240> piece<00:02:34.840> of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
normally would use a longer piece of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.570 
normally would use a longer piece of
this<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:35.650> double<00:02:35.950> wrap<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.460> way

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
this but double wrap it all the way

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.220 
this but double wrap it all the way
around<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.480> makes<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.930> connection

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
around and this makes this connection

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.800 
around and this makes this connection
entirely<00:02:38.890> watertight<00:02:39.670> okay<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.600> often

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
entirely watertight okay and it often

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
entirely watertight okay and it often
can<00:02:41.290> be<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.590> point<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:41.920> you're<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.220> back<00:02:42.400> in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
can be you point if you're going back in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.700 
can be you point if you're going back in
a<00:02:42.670> zip<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> installer<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:44.020> go<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.200> an<00:02:44.410> LMP

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
a zip and installer to go to an LMP

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.050 
a zip and installer to go to an LMP
afterwards<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.280> actually<00:02:45.610> get<00:02:45.730> yourself

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
afterwards that actually get yourself

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.610 
afterwards that actually get yourself
you'd<00:02:46.510> often<00:02:46.780> need<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:46.990> use<00:02:47.110> your<00:02:47.350> snips

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you'd often need to use your snips

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.680 
you'd often need to use your snips
actually<00:02:47.980> cut<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.250> off<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.240> ideal<00:02:49.390> for

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
actually cut it off so it's ideal for

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.440 
actually cut it off so it's ideal for
this<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:50.560> also<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.370> used<00:02:51.730> with<00:02:52.030> say<00:02:52.240> in

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
this but also it can be used with say in

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.510 
this but also it can be used with say in
circumstances<00:02:53.110> where<00:02:53.770> you're<00:02:53.980> forced<00:02:54.220> to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
circumstances where you're forced to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.790 
circumstances where you're forced to
join<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.880> cable<00:02:55.390> outside<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.500> never<00:02:56.710> a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
join a cable outside now it's never a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.500 
join a cable outside now it's never a
good<00:02:56.890> idea<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.580> joins<00:02:57.880> outside<00:02:58.300> but

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
good idea to have joins outside but

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
good idea to have joins outside but
possibly<00:02:59.140> they<00:02:59.680> might<00:02:59.860> be<00:02:59.950> unavoidable

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
possibly they might be unavoidable

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.440 
possibly they might be unavoidable
simply<00:03:00.850> because<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.150> have<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
simply because you don't have a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.670 
simply because you don't have a
replacement<00:03:01.660> cable<00:03:02.260> long<00:03:02.380> enough<00:03:02.620> for

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
replacement cable long enough for

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.320 
replacement cable long enough for
something<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.400> if<00:03:04.000> that's<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
something like this and if that's the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.080 
something like this and if that's the
situation<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.530> use<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:07.000> know

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
situation you can use this and you know

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.760 
situation you can use this and you know
it<00:03:07.300> certain<00:03:07.600> circumstances<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.410> will<00:03:08.470> work

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
it certain circumstances it will work

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.160 
it certain circumstances it will work
quite<00:03:08.890> well<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.670> an<00:03:09.970> ideal<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
quite well but an ideal for and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.590 
quite well but an ideal for and
receiving<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:12.100> their<00:03:12.280> enemies<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.300> that's<00:03:13.480> an

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
receiving of their enemies so that's an
