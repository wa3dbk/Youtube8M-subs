videography<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.760> photography<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:10.639> have<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
videography and photography I have this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.410 
videography and photography I have this
camera<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.530> bought<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.740> recently<00:00:14.420> Canon

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
camera I just bought it recently Canon

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.400 
camera I just bought it recently Canon
70d<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:18.830> it's<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.980> nice<00:00:20.160> camera<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.260> bought<00:00:22.260> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
70d and it's a nice camera I bought it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.410 
70d and it's a nice camera I bought it
as<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> kid<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.789> comes<00:00:24.060> together<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
as a kid and it comes together with the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.769 
as a kid and it comes together with the
ok<00:00:27.420> quality<00:00:27.990> lenses<00:00:28.910> for<00:00:29.910> example<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
ok quality lenses for example this one

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.750 
ok quality lenses for example this one
is<00:00:30.920> 18<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.489> 55<00:00:33.059> millimeter<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.100> SMT

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
is 18 to 55 millimeter and this is SMT

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.830 
is 18 to 55 millimeter and this is SMT
which<00:00:36.450> means<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.020> quiet<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.800> fast<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
which means it's quiet and fast of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.619 
which means it's quiet and fast of
course<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> prime<00:00:40.680> lens<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.629> high

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
course it's not a prime lens or high

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.340 
course it's not a prime lens or high
quality<00:00:42.690> lens<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.969> does<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.870> decent

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
quality lens but it does pretty decent

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
quality lens but it does pretty decent
job<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.930> also<00:00:49.200> says<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.489> macro

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
job but it also says here it's a macro

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
job but it also says here it's a macro
it's<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.660> macro<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.780> quite<00:00:55.230> really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it's can do macro but not quite really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.150 
it's can do macro but not quite really
macro<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> tried<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.989> don't<00:00:58.920> consider

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
macro I tried it and I don't consider

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.630 
macro I tried it and I don't consider
this<00:00:59.730> as<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.690> macro<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:01.649> people<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.280> say

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
this as a macro as most people will say

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
this as a macro as most people will say
what<00:01:03.600> macro<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:07.010> have<00:01:08.010> seen<00:01:08.340> some

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
what macro is but I have seen some

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
what macro is but I have seen some
videos<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.390> YouTube<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:11.750> get

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
videos on YouTube so you can get

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.770 
videos on YouTube so you can get
extension<00:01:13.439> tubes<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.119> get<00:01:15.119> pretty<00:01:15.450> good

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
extension tubes and get pretty good

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.440 
extension tubes and get pretty good
images<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.970> anything<00:01:18.350> macro<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> decided

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
images of anything macro so I decided

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
images of anything macro so I decided
why<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.740> try<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.270> bought<00:01:24.720> me<00:01:25.880> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
why don't I try it and I bought me this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.440 
why don't I try it and I bought me this
extension<00:01:27.360> tube<00:01:28.170> kit<00:01:28.850> made<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.240> chemical<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
extension tube kit made by chemical and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.480 
extension tube kit made by chemical and
it's<00:01:33.450> made<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.900> Japan

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's made in Japan

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's made in Japan
so<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.759> should<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.329> decent<00:01:37.579> here<00:01:38.579> are

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so it should be pretty decent here are

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.560 
so it should be pretty decent here are
the<00:01:38.939> three<00:01:39.799> different<00:01:40.799> sizes<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.430> tubes<00:01:41.880> one

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the three different sizes of tubes one

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
the three different sizes of tubes one
is<00:01:42.780> 12<00:01:43.140> millimeter<00:01:44.360> 20<00:01:45.360> millimeters<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.340> 36

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is 12 millimeter 20 millimeters and 36

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.260 
is 12 millimeter 20 millimeters and 36
millimeters<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.680> decided<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.790> crazy

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
millimeters so I decided to go crazy

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.789 
millimeters so I decided to go crazy
with<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> biggest<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:54.049> that's<00:01:55.049> that's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
with the biggest one and that's that's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.179 
with the biggest one and that's that's
what<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> did<00:01:56.340> basically<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.409> installed<00:01:58.409> 36

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
what I did basically I installed 36

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
what I did basically I installed 36
millimeter<00:02:00.049> extension<00:02:01.049> 2

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
millimeter extension 2

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:13.900 
millimeter extension 2
to<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.030> camera<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:07.099> a<00:02:08.099> lens

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.980 

and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.960> didn't<00:02:15.800> want<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.130> go<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.700> outside<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
and I didn't want to go and outside you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.340 
and I didn't want to go and outside you
know<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.970> spend<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.090> lot<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.270> time<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.780> do<00:02:20.900> macro

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
know and spend a lot of time to do macro

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.650 
know and spend a lot of time to do macro
so<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> decided<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:23.120> try<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.580> do<00:02:25.580> macro<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.210> my

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
so I decided to try to do macro on my

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.820 
so I decided to try to do macro on my
eye<00:02:27.220> basically<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:30.700> how<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> did<00:02:32.090> this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
eye basically and how I did this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.160 
eye basically and how I did this
I've<00:02:33.830> set<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.640> camera<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.920> around<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.420> saw<00:02:38.420> 200

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
I've set a camera to around I saw 200

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.490 
I've set a camera to around I saw 200
and<00:02:41.680> shutter<00:02:42.680> speed<00:02:43.220> was<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:44.120> believe<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:47.470> 60

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.190 

and<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:52.130> course<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:52.910> twist<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.540> extension

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and of course with twist this extension

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.510 
and of course with twist this extension
tube<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.830> biggest<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.970> have<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.600> to

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
tube the biggest one you have to go to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.550 
tube the biggest one you have to go to
come<00:03:01.520> close<00:03:01.910> as<00:03:02.210> possible<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.020> lens<00:03:03.260> to

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
come close as possible to the lens to

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.590 
come close as possible to the lens to
get<00:03:03.710> nice<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.740> sharp<00:03:06.740> image<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.180> what<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.420> did

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
get nice and sharp image so what I did

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.740 
get nice and sharp image so what I did
because<00:03:09.080> when<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:09.890> come<00:03:10.130> closer<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.920> lens

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
because when you come closer to the lens

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.210 
because when you come closer to the lens
obviously<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:15.250> closing<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.490> light<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:18.220> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
obviously you closing the light so the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.630 
obviously you closing the light so the
light<00:03:19.250> from<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.210> object<00:03:21.220> wouldn't<00:03:22.220> be<00:03:22.340> enough

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
light from the object wouldn't be enough

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.450 
light from the object wouldn't be enough
to<00:03:23.030> give<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> good<00:03:23.810> picture<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.160> what<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.340> did

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
to give you a good picture so what I did

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.650 
to give you a good picture so what I did

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
just I use this light and here how I did

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.550 
just I use this light and here how I did
this<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.140> came<00:03:34.070> closer<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.790> much<00:03:35.570> as<00:03:35.780> possible

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
this I came closer as much as possible

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.130 
this I came closer as much as possible
and<00:03:37.480> since<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.720> kinda<00:03:39.170> has<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.680> nice<00:03:41.140> you

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
and since this kinda has this nice you

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.720 
and since this kinda has this nice you
know<00:03:42.760> swivel<00:03:43.760> display<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:45.500> was<00:03:46.130> really

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
know swivel display it was really

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.150 
know swivel display it was really
convenient<00:03:47.180> for<00:03:47.600> me<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:49.450> look<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.950> lens

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
convenient for me to look in the lens

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.890 
convenient for me to look in the lens
and<00:03:52.640> with<00:03:53.300> my<00:03:53.480> other<00:03:53.780> eye<00:03:55.030> see<00:03:56.030> if<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.810> image

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and with my other eye see if the image

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.090 
and with my other eye see if the image
is<00:03:57.230> sharp<00:03:58.240> so<00:03:59.240> I<00:03:59.270> can<00:03:59.570> control<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.709> sharpness

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
is sharp so I can control the sharpness

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.440 
is sharp so I can control the sharpness
the<00:04:01.640> distance<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.830> needed<00:04:03.830> by<00:04:04.790> looking<00:04:05.180> at<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
the distance I needed by looking at the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.440 
the distance I needed by looking at the
display<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.820> then<00:04:07.820> I<00:04:08.300> just<00:04:09.400> brought<00:04:10.450> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
display and then I just brought the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.930 
display and then I just brought the
light<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:13.010> way<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.520> was<00:04:13.880> lighting<00:04:14.330> in<00:04:14.450> my<00:04:14.630> eye
