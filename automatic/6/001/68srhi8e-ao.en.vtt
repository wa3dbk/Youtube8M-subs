00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
otherwise is going to make me look like

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.220 
otherwise is going to make me look like
an<00:00:34.100> absolute<00:00:34.280> idiot<00:00:34.399> but<00:00:34.730> hg<00:00:35.180> very<00:00:35.840> carefully

taken top over the large force I almost
conservatively<00:00:39.320> view<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.670> looks<00:00:43.880> like<00:00:44.059> it

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750

through<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.119> dome<00:01:17.390> now<00:01:17.600> they<00:01:17.720> might<00:01:17.930> be

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
through to the dome now they might be

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
trying to put a phase gate in here yes i

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
trying to put a phase gate in here yes i
think<00:01:19.729> that's<00:01:20.030> what<00:01:20.150> they<00:01:20.270> were<00:01:20.330> trying<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.600> do

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
think that's what they were trying to do

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.460 
think that's what they were trying to do
but<00:01:21.260> they<00:01:21.470> just<00:01:21.770> got<00:01:21.920> totally<00:01:22.390> cleaned<00:01:23.390> up<00:01:23.659> by

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
but they just got totally cleaned up by

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.289 
but they just got totally cleaned up by
the<00:01:24.830> way<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.189> get<00:01:25.430> cleaned<00:01:25.700> up<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.119> looks

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
the way to get cleaned up but it looks

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.880 
the way to get cleaned up but it looks
like<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.780> know<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.049> didn't<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.500> didn't

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
like you know it didn't it didn't

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.070 
like you know it didn't it didn't
backfire<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:28.970> him<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.180> was<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.299> good<00:01:29.540> player<00:01:29.810> by

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
backfire on him it was a good player by

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.039 
backfire on him it was a good player by
them<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.970> looks<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.360> they<00:01:32.509> were<00:01:32.540> trying<00:01:32.720> to

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
them it looks like they were trying to

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.749 
them it looks like they were trying to
do<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.170> phase<00:01:33.409> phase<00:01:34.009> gate<00:01:34.250> tech<00:01:34.430> they<00:01:34.549> probably

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
do a phase phase gate tech they probably

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.969 
do a phase phase gate tech they probably
wanted<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.150> take<00:01:35.330> this<00:01:35.479> area<00:01:35.900> very<00:01:36.080> common

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
wanted to take this area very common

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.280 
wanted to take this area very common
area<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.490> take<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> phase<00:01:38.689> gate<00:01:38.960> but<00:01:39.170> they

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
area to take for a phase gate but they

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.810 
area to take for a phase gate but they
were<00:01:39.380> unable<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.220> but<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.549> like<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
were unable to do that but I like the

it<00:02:18.810> down<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.800> know<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.280> interesting<00:02:20.459> if

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it down you know it's interesting if

it down you know it's interesting if
they<00:02:21.000> could<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> power<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> phase

they could get the power and a phase

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.050 
they could get the power and a phase
again<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> fantastic<00:02:23.310> choke

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
again up here this is a fantastic choke

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
again up here this is a fantastic choke
point<00:02:24.390> between<00:02:24.930> both<00:02:25.380> hives<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.250> only

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
point between both hives the only

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
point between both hives the only
problem<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.330> very<00:02:27.510> tight<00:02:27.720> corridor

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
problem is it's a very tight corridor

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.740 
problem is it's a very tight corridor
which<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.860> making<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.700> very<00:02:29.730> alien<00:02:30.390> friendly

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
which is making it very alien friendly

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.290 
which is making it very alien friendly
it<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.530> these<00:02:32.190> skulks<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.700> mean<00:02:32.849> they<00:02:32.940> can't<00:02:33.150> run

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
it is these skulks I mean they can't run

there<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.510> uh<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> nice<00:03:11.010> try<00:03:11.340> again

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
there but uh it was a nice try again

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.789 
there but uh it was a nice try again
from<00:03:11.790> each<00:03:11.880> team<00:03:12.060> at<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.450> time<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.380> time<00:03:13.620> it

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
from each team at that time that time it

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.199 
from each team at that time that time it
went<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.069> little<00:03:14.220> worse<00:03:14.519> than<00:03:14.549> earlier<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
went a little worse than earlier in the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.750 
went a little worse than earlier in the
dome<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:15.630> they<00:03:15.750> actually<00:03:15.900> dropped<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
dome because they actually dropped the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.069 
dome because they actually dropped the
phase<00:03:17.760> gate<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.150> now<00:03:18.239> they've<00:03:18.390> lost<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.930> and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
phase gate and now they've lost it and

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
phase gate and now they've lost it and
that<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> loss<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.829> resources<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:21.269> at<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
that is a loss of resources so at the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.569 
that is a loss of resources so at the
moment<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.959> aliens<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.709> not<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:23.280> any

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
moment the aliens do not have any

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.440 
moment the aliens do not have any
upgrades<00:03:25.280> beyond<00:03:28.220> beyond<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.400> Lee<00:03:29.760> leap<00:03:30.060> sorry

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
upgrades beyond beyond a Lee leap sorry

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.940 
upgrades beyond beyond a Lee leap sorry
about<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:31.079> getting<00:03:31.350> tons<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.799> messages

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
about that I'm getting tons of messages

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.520 
about that I'm getting tons of messages
from<00:03:32.280> other<00:03:32.430> people<00:03:32.760> Oh<00:03:32.910> leap<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.019> going<00:03:34.290> up<00:03:34.440> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
from other people Oh leap is going up so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.720 
from other people Oh leap is going up so
that's<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.769> first<00:03:34.920> ability<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.489> only

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
that's the first ability the only

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.920 
that's the first ability the only
exception<00:03:36.060> research<00:03:36.329> interesting<00:03:36.810> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
exception research interesting that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.430 
exception research interesting that
we've<00:03:37.049> seen<00:03:37.350> no<00:03:37.680> cracks<00:03:38.370> or<00:03:38.910> shade<00:03:39.660> path<00:03:40.049> yet

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
we've seen no cracks or shade path yet

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.490 
we've seen no cracks or shade path yet
so<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.980> choice<00:03:41.130> between<00:03:41.400> defensive

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
so that's a choice between defensive

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.199 
so that's a choice between defensive
movements<00:03:43.500> or<00:03:43.620> deception<00:03:44.190> abilities<00:03:45.060> and

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
movements or deception abilities and

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.970 
movements or deception abilities and
usually<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.660> will<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.019> seen<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.620> at<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
usually you will have seen it now at the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.559 
usually you will have seen it now at the
3-minute<00:03:47.400> mark<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.730> we<00:03:47.819> aren't<00:03:48.000> seeing<00:03:48.359> it

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
3-minute mark but we aren't seeing it

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.140 
3-minute mark but we aren't seeing it
yet<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.220> wasabi<00:03:50.579> teen<00:03:50.940> so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
yet out of the wasabi teen so

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
yet out of the wasabi teen so
interesting<00:03:51.569> play<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.230> leap<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.650> up<00:03:52.769> and

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
interesting play but leap is up and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.050 
interesting play but leap is up and
that's<00:03:53.069> going<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.250> make<00:03:53.340> these<00:03:53.489> folks<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.850> lot

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
that's going to make these folks a lot

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.030 
that's going to make these folks a lot
more<00:03:54.180> deadly<00:03:54.510> they<00:03:54.989> can<00:03:55.170> leap<00:03:55.350> up<00:03:55.500> Marines<00:03:55.829> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
more deadly they can leap up Marines to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.650 
more deadly they can leap up Marines to
close<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.549> distance<00:03:58.910> yeah<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.239> know<00:04:00.480> one

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
close the distance yeah so you know one

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.240 
close the distance yeah so you know one
of<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> things<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.380> downside<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.100> going

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
of the things that's a downside to going

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.890 
of the things that's a downside to going
for<00:04:02.549> early<00:04:02.850> second<00:04:03.180> hive<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.359> course<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.870> that

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
for early second hive of course is that

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.569 
for early second hive of course is that
you're<00:04:04.079> dropping<00:04:04.470> almost<00:04:04.739> all<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.220> your<00:04:05.340> team

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
you're dropping almost all of your team

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.120 
you're dropping almost all of your team
resources<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.450> that's<00:04:07.170> that's<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.950> big

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
resources and that's that's a big

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.970 
resources and that's that's a big
problem<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.720> don't<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.319> whole<00:04:10.680> lot<00:04:10.709> to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
problem you don't have a whole lot to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
problem you don't have a whole lot to
help<00:04:11.069> back<00:04:11.310> your<00:04:11.519> team<00:04:11.760> up<00:04:11.970> as<00:04:12.180> far<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.690> the

abilities go or you know say a shift or

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.379 
abilities go or you know say a shift or
a<00:04:15.150> crag<00:04:15.420> or<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> veil<00:04:16.459> shade<00:04:17.459> it's<00:04:17.820> just<00:04:18.060> it's

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
a crag or a veil shade it's just it's

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.360 
a crag or a veil shade it's just it's
too<00:04:18.479> much<00:04:18.659> and<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.049> phase<00:04:19.739> gate<00:04:20.009> in<00:04:20.159> East

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
too much and the phase gate in East

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.860 
too much and the phase gate in East
Junction<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.090> going<00:04:21.329> down<00:04:21.449> now<00:04:21.569> this<00:04:21.719> is<00:04:21.840> a

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
Junction is going down now this is a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.929 
Junction is going down now this is a
conservative<00:04:22.379> phase<00:04:22.800> gate<00:04:23.069> this<00:04:23.520> phase<00:04:23.729> gate

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:23.939 
conservative phase gate this phase gate

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.700 
conservative phase gate this phase gate
was<00:04:24.060> placed<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.539> position<00:04:24.710> relatively

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
was placed in a position relatively

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.179 
was placed in a position relatively
close<00:04:26.099> to<00:04:26.879> command<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:27.960> was<00:04:28.560> hg<00:04:28.949> saying

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
close to command so that was hg saying

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.110 
close to command so that was hg saying
all<00:04:29.340> right<00:04:29.370> we're<00:04:29.550> not<00:04:29.580> gonna<00:04:29.699> be<00:04:29.849> able<00:04:29.909> place

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
all right we're not gonna be able place

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.610 
all right we're not gonna be able place
to<00:04:30.240> face<00:04:30.389> gateway<00:04:30.749> down<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.169> your<00:04:31.379> territory

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
to face gateway down in your territory

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.649 
to face gateway down in your territory
will<00:04:31.979> place<00:04:32.159> it<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.460> ours<00:04:32.699> but<00:04:33.029> again<00:04:33.479> it's

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
will place it in ours but again it's

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.170 
will place it in ours but again it's
been<00:04:33.870> destroyed<00:04:34.529> and<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> bad<00:04:35.789> bad

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
been destroyed and that is a bad bad

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.670 
been destroyed and that is a bad bad
thing<00:04:36.210> for<00:04:36.509> HD<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.080> they've<00:04:37.289> lost<00:04:37.469> Appa

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
thing for HD and they've lost Appa

thing for HD and they've lost Appa
graphical<00:04:38.129> analysis<00:04:38.639> extractor<00:04:39.210> they're<00:04:39.569> now

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
graphical analysis extractor they're now

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.749 
graphical analysis extractor they're now
down<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.050> two<00:04:40.199> extractors<00:04:40.740> equal<00:04:41.219> with<00:04:41.550> the

down to two extractors equal with the

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.850 
down to two extractors equal with the
aliens<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.360> we<00:04:42.479> know<00:04:42.689> that<00:04:43.199> in<00:04:43.319> these<00:04:43.469> builds

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
aliens but we know that in these builds

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.159 
aliens but we know that in these builds
of<00:04:43.919> NS<00:04:44.159> to<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.389> very<00:04:45.569> asymmetrical

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
of NS to this is a very asymmetrical

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.110 
of NS to this is a very asymmetrical
game<00:04:46.469> and<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.800> Marines<00:04:47.069> to<00:04:47.400> need<00:04:47.789> more
