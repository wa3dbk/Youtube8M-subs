all the skin because it will like cling
to<00:01:42.840> your<00:01:43.020> dry<00:01:43.350> patches<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.430> good<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to your dry patches but it's not good to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
to your dry patches but it's not good to
get<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.570> dry<00:01:45.840> skin<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.439> well

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
get something for dry skin as well

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
get something for dry skin as well
because<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.520> make<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.060> oily<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
because it will make it look oily so

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240 
because it will make it look oily so
it's<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.320> hard<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> find<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> foundation

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's really hard to find a foundation

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's really hard to find a foundation
that<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.750> skin<00:01:52.020> type<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that is good for this skin type but this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
that is good for this skin type but this
is<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.850> great<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
is really great and I think it's for

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.499 
is really great and I think it's for
soup<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> skin<00:01:56.549> types<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.149> definitely

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
soup a lot of skin types so definitely

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.330 
soup a lot of skin types so definitely
give<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> try<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.680> are<00:01:58.770> ready<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
give this a try if you are ready for a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.590 
give this a try if you are ready for a
great<00:01:59.759> dresser<00:02:00.299> foundation<00:02:00.899> I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
great dresser foundation I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.510 
great dresser foundation I
the<00:02:02.900> expensive<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.530> gallon<00:02:03.800> on<00:02:03.890> sale<00:02:04.190> but<00:02:04.460> I

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
the expensive a gallon on sale but I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.330 
the expensive a gallon on sale but I
think<00:02:04.790> it's<00:02:04.909> about<00:02:05.620> seven<00:02:06.620> or<00:02:06.770> eight<00:02:06.800> dollars

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
think it's about seven or eight dollars

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.749 
think it's about seven or eight dollars
I'm<00:02:07.909> not<00:02:08.060> really<00:02:08.240> sure<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.140> yes<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.520> has<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
I'm not really sure but yes it has a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.460 
I'm not really sure but yes it has a
medium<00:02:11.360> coverage<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.900> would<00:02:12.050> say<00:02:12.200> not<00:02:12.410> really

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
medium coverage I would say not really

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.980 
medium coverage I would say not really
the<00:02:12.950> greatest<00:02:13.640> coverage<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.360> sometimes<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the greatest coverage is sometimes I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.150 
the greatest coverage is sometimes I
still<00:02:15.170> need<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.530> use<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.800> little<00:02:16.040> bit<00:02:16.100> of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
still need to use a little bit of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
still need to use a little bit of
concealer<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.090> fits<00:02:17.300> just<00:02:17.450> fine<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.959> me<00:02:17.990> I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
before I put on my foundation then I

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.640 
before I put on my foundation then I

this<00:03:06.680> with<00:03:07.100> my<00:03:07.250> fingers<00:03:07.670> because<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.180> think

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
this with my fingers because I think

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.289 
this with my fingers because I think
this<00:03:08.540> gives<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.049> really<00:03:09.080> nice<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> even

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
this gives a really nice and even

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.600 
this gives a really nice and even
application<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.160> tell<00:03:13.220> this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
application and as you can tell this

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910 
application and as you can tell this
really<00:03:14.060> matches<00:03:14.510> my<00:03:14.660> skin<00:03:14.900> perfectly<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.799> I

really matches my skin perfectly and I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.259 
really matches my skin perfectly and I

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
think that's what they were going for

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.380 
think that's what they were going for
with<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:17.989> foundation<00:03:18.230> um<00:03:18.829> specifically
