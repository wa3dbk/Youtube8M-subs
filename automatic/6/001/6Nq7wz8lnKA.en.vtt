00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.870
 We remember the German 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.910
 Deliveries of weapons to the Kurds in the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 Northern Iraq and our Chancellor 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.130
 At that time, saying what is weighs heavier than 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.230
 what could be what that could be 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.690
 could now have joined with the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010
 words by Thorsten Stephan 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.650
 lieutenant colonel of the Bundeswehr we can 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.279
 do not track where the individual weapons 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.930
 go forth 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 we have no knowledge about that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 individual battalions or even companies 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.810
 where the weapons are 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 So the criticism was finally 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.230
 probably or probably 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.189
 entitles you to more empty frings im 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.189
 talk with karin leukefeld 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.850
 Yesterday I already announced 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.620
 that we are closer today with the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 Weapons deliveries to the pester 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 employ 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.410
 I have skin today Karin 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.899
 leukefeld switched on she is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.079
 Journalist mostly in the middle east 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 on the way contact before leukefeld beautiful 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 down woman leuke field 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.239
 since burning natural as the first time the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.489
 ask on the tongue 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.270
 where are the Germans going now? 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.739
 Weapons deliveries go to the anniversaries 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 yes that is the official presentation 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.040
 So these weapons are delivered in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 erbil 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 this is the capital of Kurdish 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 autonomous region in north irak and then 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.890
 Are passed as to contact people 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.270
 from the Kurdish peschmerga and it is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 obviously so that there too 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.530
 Insight of the Bundeswehr so ​​stop where 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 these weapons go that is in them 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.869
 give it to the fleet hitters and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.060
 depeche merker is not an army now 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.380
 as you know it from the Bundeswehr 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 but these are different units 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.810
 So they probably have weapons there 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.280
 split up among themselves 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 the peshmerga in northern irak are under 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.259
 essentially the control of massud 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 Barzani 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.549
 He is the chairman of the Kurdish 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.899
 Democratic Party 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.840
 this is just a fraction of 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.780
 Kurds in northern Iraq and to that extent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 these troops of barsani are concrete 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.940
 fully equipped with 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.860
 is then to be expected that if the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.500
 with is or with the islamic state 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.610
 finished in quotation marks that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.170
 They then deliver the weapons obediently again 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 that's not to be expected at all 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.800
 that is also the story of everyone 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.270
 Weapons you delivered somewhere 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.620
 So we're gonna be with you 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.380
 security not returned the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 be at most against other people 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 used in the case of the customer if 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
 they actually keep those weapons 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.250
 should and not the Islamic 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.180
 state decreases them this weapon 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.920
 in fighting then it could be very good 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.530
 that they are against other Kurdish 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.570
 fractions are used 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.420
 because the history of the customers in the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.760
 Northern Iraq is a story 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.800
 the inner-city competition one has 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.560
 me a goal you have me one 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.810
 Political line and just in northern Iraq 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.120
 So, in the 1990s, has one 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.310
 right war between the kdp of 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 massud barsani and the puk a of celal 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.459
 Talabani given with many hundreds 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.160
 kill 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.230
 and that pretty much excluded that way 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.700
 something then again this happens 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.170
 year to start who weapons here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.430
 miss to protect human life 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.370
 what does it look like now? 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.890
 simply the face of the victims were 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.630
 Saved and saved 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.579
 what about the compliance of the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.980
 human rights through the amplifiers 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.200
 So I think the whole development of the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.049
 last years there in the region of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.070
 Middle East shows that 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.829
 Weapons delivery not at all 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.920
 contribute to any human life 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.989
 save or protect human rights 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 but the victim number the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.230
 The number of refugees is rising steadily and 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.030
 a very clear sign that there so 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.600
 the wrong policy is being pursued 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.660
 with this militarization what the per 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.890
 schmerker particularly affects the kdp 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.109
 from massud barsani this group will 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.849
 So for a long time accused that 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.360
 you on human rights within the 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.740
 Kurdish 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.530
 There are reports of disrespect 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.860
 secret prisons so of persons 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.099
 they were kidnapped by special forces 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.509
 the peshmerga then in any 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.300
 dungeons disappeared 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.129
 someday if they were lucky and that 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.229
 have survived have surfaced again 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.729
 and that's about it then reported 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.360
 for example, have Amnesty International 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.520
 or often journalists 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.710
 affected so they are being tracked because 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.990
 Do not follow the politics of massud barsani 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.789
 according to report there was 2010 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.159
 case which became very well known where 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.060
 a young journalist was kidnapped and 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:11.569
 found murdered two days later 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.080
 But civilian population is also present 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:19.400
 the encroachment in these special forces 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.919
 the peschmerga not protected and many 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.169
 loser as always in the war before 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.300
 leukefeld i thank you for your 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.669
 answer and for your explanation 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.400
 a winner is in any case already 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.889
 firmly the German armaments industry 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.330
 allowed this time for the first time weapons too 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.330
 to deliver to a war region
