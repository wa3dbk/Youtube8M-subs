 the flour on the worktop to which I

 I've already added vanillin 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.950
 let's have a little hole in the middle where 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.870
 we put the egg yolk a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.740
 small piece of st 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:58.940
 sugar all around the pieces 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.940
 of cold butter clearly 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.549
 we also add the lemon peel 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.950
 grated now 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.400
 we knead everything well and much 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.400
 quickly 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.630
 with the dough formed a beautiful ball 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.599
 dances homogeneous and now I leave a fridge for 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.680
 at least half an hour created out of the fridge 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.180
 the pastry and omitted on the top 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 from work with a little flour and now 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.319
 the stand with the model aside 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.610
 got hold of one out 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:43.610
 piece to make the strips stretched out the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.040
 shortcrust I put it under in the pan that 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.660
 I previously covered with the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.330
 greaseproof paper and edges or buttered 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.970
 the pastry on the base or made a light 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.299
 border only with the fingers pushing the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.340
 dough at the sides hole the base with the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.970
 modiche fork in cooking not yes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.340
 swollen do not face the bubbles and there towards 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.799
 above the jam this jam of 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
 Homemade raspberries is a bit liquid 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.590
 so it takes more than normal 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.090
 because then during cooking it will tend to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.340
 to accept more, that is to evaporate in 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.290
 practice then we abuse let's do 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.070
 then take the strips 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.870
 shortbread remained and we break it again e 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.720
 with the appropriate wheel or with a 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.720
 simple knife we get the strips 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.670
 as I have some fresh raspberries 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.409
 frozen but still fresh it 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.510
 I distribute as a further decoration 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.890
 Now put on the cake in the oven at 180 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 degrees for about half an hour
