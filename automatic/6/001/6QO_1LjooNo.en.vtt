00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 Y 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.240
 make a supposed programs we came 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.250
 interview one of the stores that remains 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.230
 in this building and in fact I was interested 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.289
 quite long 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.449
 the berga space so many stores and for 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.680
 that's why we invited oscar gonzález 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.930
 and also he knows what other projects 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 so that he can tell us everything he has 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.390
 thought of this floor because it's a 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 complete good concept 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.989
 Y 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.290
 is a design center is a building 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.950
 that was thought for that purpose because the idea is 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.250
 that all office stores have 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.610
 what to do with the design because I feel that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.450
 there are exhibition places there is a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.900
 good is the chairs shop 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.610
 there is a good lighting store 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.610
 large there is an art gallery 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.340
 cecilia gonzález and also a store of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 design objects that's in the second 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 floor and on the third floor practically 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.000
 they are offices 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.880
 in the field is a small piece of land 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.880
 500 meters and has only 17 meters 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.550
 in front then the typical solution of 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.710
 the office was to make offices that look 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.340
 to the street and offices that look in the background 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 then it was unfair that someone 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.479
 I will look at the street and when I look at the background 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.970
 the background is not nice with the background either 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.350
 you have all the disordered roofs 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.140
 So what we did was opt for the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.250
 free space to cut it and generate a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.710
 space 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.310
 side that I know and everyone has the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.310
 same condition 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.800
 it occurred to us to invite verónica cruz 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.720
 that she is an artist and she had already 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.600
 worked with me on the sculptures in 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.180
 wood with these formwork woods 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.840
 old of the work then we told him 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.090
 good veronica here you have a wall of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 25 m long x 6 meters high 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.299
 following 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.760
 this how do you get to this 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.500
 approach was not really just 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120
 make a green wall because you could 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.799
 He has done a vertical garden as 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.000
 that already exist but the idea was a bit 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.909
 combine and that I think is merit 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 also of oscar that this what has 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.829
 wanted to combine is the green of the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 vertical gardens but also the 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.720
 sculptural aspect is to say that this 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.269
 be a work halfway east between 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 the sculpture between the garden and between the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.390
 landscape
