00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.569
 I am a piece and today I am here to show you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.990
 the pupa mod 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.300
 let's start right away but let's see what 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
 It introduces us to this new fashion this 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.480
 new fashion introduces us let's say a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.490
 universe because why through this 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 so we can craft these ingots 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.990
 in which we then do all these 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.130
 tools also includes the armor of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.399
 then how do we do this 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.460
 we have to craft a toilet first 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.850
 how we do it with three blocks of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.129
 aaron ingot in vertical 2 let's say so 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.860
 in total, six blocks of ingot are needed 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.379
 put in the shape of a walter with a central one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.420
 water basketball we think to Taranto 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.399
 place a little more and what we do 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.840
 to use it we have to fill it with 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 a water basket 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.370
 we fill we can very well give up 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 his prang if nothing is needed though 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 never this mulder rm and what we do 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.559
 we need toilet paper like 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 remember with three papers they give us these 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.040
 toilet now we must have must 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.650
 get this city on paper gems a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.939
 jules on paper 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.390
 wait until I show you now 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.880
 as you do click with the right button 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 on the toilet with water you see that there 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 create this shift on paper we take them 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.299
 a little more because I need more 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 ok until we say nothing 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.860
 return normal toilet now we have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.979
 even a bit of down a paper e 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.810
 we can craft these blocks 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.430
 we can pick up shipping like it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.290
 let's do now I'll show you to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 Now to make the tools and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 What we need to do first 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.729
 we have to craft this block ie 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.490
 shift lush.it goes well the same thing 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 we put in total four cities 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 paper will decide this blog of shift then 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.969
 to have bullion what we must do 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.649
 we have to cook this exit 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.619
 on paper now I'll show you for 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.619
 a moment a col. furnace 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.360
 perfect earth moment with the go e 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.680
 let's put a block of choices that I don't have 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.900
 put it we put it to cook and it gives us the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.580
 shit ingot 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.080
 through this minor craft craft 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.240
 also this super chic which is more 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 we say a decoration or we can 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.380
 craft all these items now 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640
 let's say spurred on an island e 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.010
 so it's not like I have so much choice 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.470
 see the ingot we can kraft hurley 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.560
 normally the usual way we wear 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
 armor this po armor 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.820
 look sucks i'm wearing 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 the friend and now I take off the creative vi 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.690
 let me show the force for a moment let's say 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.880
 which are pretty tools 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.220
 resistant I have to say sorry enough 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.100
 strong even resistant ie there is one 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.650
 powerful boys looks like a suit of armor 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.540
 hoe almost the diamond and does not wear out 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.330
 for nothing then I must say that it is 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 resistant to the test to dig too 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.100
 this looks like an iron bar pickaxe 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.570
 diamond does not ruin a lot e 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.470
 digs very fast 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.730
 I must say that I am really a nice pic 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.650
 however, the hoe is also quite useful 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.420
 look at so many uses 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.570
 so I would say that we can bring the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.730
 a diamond bar iron hoe 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.989
 still really good if I had to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.670
 sell my mom will make us his 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.890
 money 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.510
 so guys I remind you to put me 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.150
 making more videos about fashions but 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.920
 simply because the fashions that are 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 coming out they really suck or I have it 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.140
 already made anyway I wanted to tell you if 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.630
 you want to see fashions even in versions 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.280
 let's say older but very nice that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.080
 have not yet been updated but that 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
 they will probably be updated 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.330
 write it below if you want to see them 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.989
 maybe built I want to see more fashions 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.060
 old 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.890
 that is maybe the ways they don't have 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.600
 updated for shaun de mode really 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.549
 spectacular even on sports that 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.709
 I know and that few people in Italy or 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.660
