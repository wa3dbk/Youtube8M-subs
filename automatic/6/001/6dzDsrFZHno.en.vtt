00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
up so let's go in and start with gruel

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.150 
up so let's go in and start with gruel
okay<00:00:21.689> now<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.230> grew<00:00:22.680> was<00:00:22.859> actually

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
okay now I thought grew was actually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
okay now I thought grew was actually
going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> bit<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.910> loop<00:00:24.150> pinata<00:00:24.510> but

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
going to be a bit of a loop pinata but

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.849 
going to be a bit of a loop pinata but
turns<00:00:25.140> out<00:00:25.260> he<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:25.470> has<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> pretty

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
turns out he actually has a pretty

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.560 
turns out he actually has a pretty

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
fight now the way inferno slice actually

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
fight now the way inferno slice actually
works<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> split<00:00:34.950> its<00:00:35.100> damage

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
works is going to split its damage

amongst everybody that it hits he casts
infernal<00:00:39.510> slice<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> hundred<00:00:40.260> energy<00:00:40.680> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
infernal slice at a hundred energy so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
infernal slice at a hundred energy so
you<00:00:40.860> seize<00:00:41.070> energy<00:00:41.460> bars<00:00:41.640> filling<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.059> pretty

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you seize energy bars filling up pretty

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.000 
you seize energy bars filling up pretty
quick<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.170> handle<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> our<00:00:43.890> off

back now I'm going to let him keep it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.830 
back now I'm going to let him keep it
and<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> green<00:01:29.250> stack

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and I'm going to go to the green stack

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.420 
and I'm going to go to the green stack
now<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> green<00:01:31.950> stack<00:01:32.220> we

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
now that I'm here in the green stack we

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
now that I'm here in the green stack we
basically<00:01:32.729> switched<00:01:33.180> roles<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
basically switched roles and I'm the one

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
basically switched roles and I'm the one
that's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.400> taunting<00:01:35.909> rule<00:01:36.180> right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that's going to be taunting rule right

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's going to be taunting rule right
when<00:01:36.750> Inferno<00:01:37.350> slices<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.220> now

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
when Inferno slices about to go out now

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.310 
when Inferno slices about to go out now
you'll<00:01:39.270> notice<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.630> spending<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> time

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you'll notice I'm spending a lot of time

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
you'll notice I'm spending a lot of time
on<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.619> mechanic<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.729> reason<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
on this mechanic and the reason for that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
on this mechanic and the reason for that
is<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.540> makes<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.020> breaks<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.320> fight<00:01:43.500> if

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
is this makes or breaks the fight if

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100 
is this makes or breaks the fight if
your<00:01:43.860> tanks<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.340> execute<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.909> quickly<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
your tanks can execute this quickly the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.090 
your tanks can execute this quickly the
rest<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> raid<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> basically<00:01:47.040> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
rest of the raid is basically just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
rest of the raid is basically just
standing<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.790> place<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.210> warding<00:01:48.479> ground

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
standing in one place of warding ground

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.980 
standing in one place of warding ground
effects<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.040> dpsing<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> healing<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.240> should

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
effects and dpsing and healing I should

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.300 
effects and dpsing and healing I should
also<00:01:52.020> point<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> reason<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
also point out that the reason that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.730 
also point out that the reason that
we're<00:01:53.610> doing<00:01:53.820> three<00:01:54.329> inferno<00:01:54.780> slices<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
we're doing three inferno slices is so

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
we're doing three inferno slices is so
that<00:01:55.979> overwhelming<00:01:56.700> blows<00:01:56.939> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that overwhelming blows which is a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.260 
that overwhelming blows which is a
secondary<00:01:57.990> tank<00:01:58.320> debuff<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.920> goes

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
secondary tank debuff that goes

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.219 
secondary tank debuff that goes
obviously<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.420> guy<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.840> tanking

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
obviously on the guy that's tanking

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
obviously on the guy that's tanking
gruel<00:02:02.360> falls<00:02:03.360> off<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.469> talk<00:02:04.920> grow<00:02:05.430> back

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gruel falls off when you talk grow back

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.889 
gruel falls off when you talk grow back
you<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.180> stack<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.750> too

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
you don't want that stack to get too

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.469 
you don't want that stack to get too
high<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> huge<00:02:08.369> deal<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.300> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
high but it's not a huge deal but we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.210 
high but it's not a huge deal but we
definitely<00:02:09.690> recommend<00:02:09.929> doing<00:02:10.440> three<00:02:10.920> stacks

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
definitely recommend doing three stacks

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.150 
definitely recommend doing three stacks
of<00:02:11.520> Inferno<00:02:11.910> slice<00:02:12.270> which<00:02:12.629> I'm<00:02:12.780> about<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
of Inferno slice which I'm about to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.790 
of Inferno slice which I'm about to
take<00:02:13.310> third<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.760> right<00:02:13.910> here<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:15.020> very

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
take third one right here and then very

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.170 
take third one right here and then very
shortly<00:02:15.890> thereafter<00:02:16.310> girls<00:02:16.760> actually<00:02:16.910> going

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
shortly thereafter girls actually going

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.210 
shortly thereafter girls actually going
to<00:02:17.330> go<00:02:17.360> right<00:02:18.110> into<00:02:18.260> his<00:02:18.470> transition<00:02:18.860> phase

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to go right into his transition phase

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.160 
to go right into his transition phase
and<00:02:19.490> that's<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.850> third<00:02:20.000> one<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.390> I'm<00:02:20.600> back<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and that's the third one so I'm back to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.800 
and that's the third one so I'm back to
tanking<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.890> boss<00:02:22.070> himself<00:02:22.810> okay

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
tanking the boss himself okay

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.540 
tanking the boss himself okay
destructive<00:02:24.380> rampage<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.430> his

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
destructive rampage that is just his

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.520 
destructive rampage that is just his
transition<00:02:25.970> phase<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.930> mean<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.470> is

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
transition phase this is I mean this is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.230 
transition phase this is I mean this is
brain<00:02:27.890> dead<00:02:27.920> mechanics<00:02:28.610> right<00:02:28.790> here<00:02:28.970> all<00:02:29.150> you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
brain dead mechanics right here all you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.330 
brain dead mechanics right here all you
have<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.660> avoid<00:02:29.930> ground<00:02:30.290> effects<00:02:30.590> don't

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
have to do is avoid ground effects don't

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.730 
have to do is avoid ground effects don't
get<00:02:31.490> hit<00:02:31.730> by<00:02:31.970> them<00:02:32.210> it's<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:32.810> free<00:02:33.020> DPS<00:02:33.440> time

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
get hit by them it's just free DPS time

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.830 
get hit by them it's just free DPS time
and<00:02:34.220> all<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:34.640> happens<00:02:35.000> afterwards<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.690> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
and all that happens afterwards is you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.620 
and all that happens afterwards is you
just<00:02:36.020> go<00:02:36.140> back<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.710> phase<00:02:37.490> one<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.090> other

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
just go back to phase one the other

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.780 
just go back to phase one the other
mechanic<00:02:39.020> I'll<00:02:39.170> point<00:02:39.470> out<00:02:39.650> when<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.490> go<00:02:40.610> back

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
mechanic I'll point out when we go back

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.140 
mechanic I'll point out when we go back
to<00:02:40.820> his<00:02:41.210> initial<00:02:41.600> phase<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.020> shatter<00:02:42.880> now<00:02:43.880> chad

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
to his initial phase is shatter now chad

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.910 
to his initial phase is shatter now chad
is<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.660> work<00:02:44.810> very<00:02:45.050> much<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> same<00:02:45.560> as

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
is going to work very much the same as

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680 
is going to work very much the same as
it<00:02:46.070> did<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.460> original<00:02:46.490> grewal<00:02:47.270> encounter

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
it did in the original grewal encounter

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.050 
it did in the original grewal encounter
where<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> number<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.800> people<00:02:48.950> will<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.550> hit<00:02:49.820> by

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
where a number of people will get hit by

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.370 
where a number of people will get hit by
a<00:02:50.590> petrified<00:02:51.590> debuff<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.190> they<00:02:52.730> will<00:02:52.970> get

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
a petrified debuff and they will get

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.570 
a petrified debuff and they will get
progressively<00:02:54.380> slowed<00:02:54.770> over<00:02:55.130> time<00:02:55.340> while

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
progressively slowed over time while

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.890 
progressively slowed over time while
they<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:55.940> II<00:02:56.000> buff<00:02:56.210> on<00:02:56.360> those<00:02:56.600> people

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
they have that II buff on those people

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.090 
they have that II buff on those people
they's<00:02:57.020> gonna<00:02:57.140> need<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.380> move<00:02:57.500> away<00:02:57.740> from<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
they's gonna need to move away from the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.040 
they's gonna need to move away from the
rate<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.490> from<00:02:58.760> each<00:02:58.910> other<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.630> doesn't<00:02:59.960> do<00:03:00.020> a

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
rate and from each other it doesn't do a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.870 
rate and from each other it doesn't do a
