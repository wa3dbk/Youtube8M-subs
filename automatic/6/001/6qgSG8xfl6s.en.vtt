00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
first you I mean at first glance you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.000 
first you I mean at first glance you
would<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.359> death<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> defense

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
would think that the death is a defense

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.830 
would think that the death is a defense
wheel<00:00:20.279> which<00:00:20.580> everyone<00:00:21.000> thought<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.539> but

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
wheel which everyone thought it was but

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
wheel which everyone thought it was but
actually<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:23.160> utilizing<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.970> spikes<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually we're utilizing the spikes at a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
actually we're utilizing the spikes at a
low<00:00:25.109> track<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.760> advantage<00:00:26.970> of

low track to you know take advantage of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
low track to you know take advantage of
the<00:00:27.630> larger<00:00:28.050> gap<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.680> synchron's<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the larger gap that synchron's have the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
the larger gap that synchron's have the
combo<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.420> obsessing<00:00:31.019> against<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.529> gargle

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
combo and obsessing against is gargle

killer can bt 145 rubber ball you can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
killer can bt 145 rubber ball you can
see<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.790> there's<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.059> larger<00:00:36.570> gap<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
see there there's a larger gap there and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.970 
see there there's a larger gap there and
it's<00:00:38.280> even<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.879> being<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.570> 45<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.379> we're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it's even with being more 45 so we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's even with being more 45 so we're
gonna<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.309> utilizing<00:00:41.940> those<00:00:42.030> spikes<00:00:42.480> gonna<00:00:42.870> be

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
gonna be utilizing those spikes gonna be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.860 
gonna be utilizing those spikes gonna be
producing<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> ton<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> smash<00:00:44.420> with<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> very

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
producing a ton of smash with a very

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
producing a ton of smash with a very
very<00:00:46.260> low<00:00:46.620> recoil<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.430> there's<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
very low recoil and there's one of the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.090 
very low recoil and there's one of the
things<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> makes<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> combo

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
things that make it makes this combo

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
things that make it makes this combo
very<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.000> threatening<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> current

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
very very threatening the current

very very threatening the current
metagame

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
metagame

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
metagame
the<00:00:52.980> obviously<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> side<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> metal

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the obviously the side of the metal

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
the obviously the side of the metal
wheel<00:00:54.449> doesn't<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.140> smash<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
wheel doesn't have much smash so you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.970 
wheel doesn't have much smash so you
could<00:00:55.949> probably<00:00:56.129> throw<00:00:56.730> something<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.149> duo

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
could probably throw something like duo

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
could probably throw something like duo
90<00:00:58.980> CS<00:00:59.640> against<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.350> beat<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.820> again

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
90 CS against it and beat it but again

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.939 
90 CS against it and beat it but again
this<00:01:03.359> thing<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> anti<00:01:03.960> meta<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.379> means<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this thing is anti meta which means that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
this thing is anti meta which means that
it<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.820> beat<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.659> portion<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it will beat a good portion of the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
it will beat a good portion of the
metagame<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.060> defense<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
metagame which is like defense and

is fixed now and that match I did go
into<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.460> stall<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.870> count<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.350> in

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
into a stall so you can count that it in

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.920 
into a stall so you can count that it in
125<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.850> don't<00:01:59.180> really<00:01:59.300> think<00:01:59.360> it's<00:01:59.660> fair<00:01:59.900> to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
125 I don't really think it's fair to

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.010 
125 I don't really think it's fair to
cancer<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.430> makes<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.700> 3<00:02:01.880> 2<00:02:01.970> 1<00:02:02.180> 3<00:02:02.540> 2<00:02:02.600> 2<00:02:02.870> if

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
cancer so that makes it 3 2 1 3 2 2 if

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.470 
cancer so that makes it 3 2 1 3 2 2 if
you<00:02:03.110> counted<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.620> stall<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.970> again

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
you counted the stall which I again

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.469 
you counted the stall which I again
didn't<00:02:05.780> count<00:02:05.960> wasn't<00:02:06.620> really<00:02:06.800> fair<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
didn't count wasn't really fair so the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.120 
didn't count wasn't really fair so the
next<00:02:08.690> match<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.110> forgot<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.500> include<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.920> in

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
next match I forgot to include this in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.700 
next match I forgot to include this in
the<00:02:10.160> intro<00:02:10.910> but<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.570> against<00:02:11.960> flash<00:02:12.410> just

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
the intro but we have against flash just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.460 
the intro but we have against flash just
to<00:02:12.830> show<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:14.300> thing<00:02:14.480> has<00:02:14.630> really

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
to show you that this thing has really

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.150 
to show you that this thing has really
low<00:02:15.680> recoil<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.460> really<00:02:16.760> high<00:02:16.940> smash

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
low recoil but really high smash

so far it is 1 2 0 and again claw she's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.540 
so far it is 1 2 0 and again claw she's
just<00:02:36.830> not<00:02:37.100> getting<00:02:37.730> anywhere<00:02:38.480> again<00:02:39.140> my<00:02:40.040> gears

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
just not getting anywhere again my gears

just not getting anywhere again my gears
skipped<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.180> didn't<00:02:42.170> get<00:02:42.320> any<00:02:42.500> could<00:02:43.070> launch

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
skipped and didn't get any could launch

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.310 
skipped and didn't get any could launch
there<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:46.030> finally<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.209> did<00:02:47.300> get<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.720> nice<00:02:47.930> battle

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
there so finally I did get a nice battle

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.810 
there so finally I did get a nice battle
here<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.630> turns<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.590> know<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.670> would

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
here and turns out you know it would

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.030 
here and turns out you know it would
seem<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.120> at<00:02:53.480> such<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> low<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.290> spin<00:02:54.860> rate

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
seem that at such a low a spin rate

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.940 
seem that at such a low a spin rate
death<00:02:55.820> can<00:02:56.150> KO<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:56.750> courtesy<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> spikes

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
death can KO but courtesy of the spikes

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.030 
death can KO but courtesy of the spikes
it<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.970> know<00:02:59.030> TKO<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.780> actually<00:03:00.680> one<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
it you know TKO and actually one of the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.949 
it you know TKO and actually one of the
interesting<00:03:01.400> things<00:03:01.640> about<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:01.970> combo<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.600> I

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
interesting things about this combo is I

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.000 
interesting things about this combo is I
did<00:03:03.200> informally<00:03:03.890> test<00:03:04.160> s<00:03:04.400> 1530<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.010> instead

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
did informally test s 1530 and instead

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.300 
did informally test s 1530 and instead
of<00:03:07.130> koe<00:03:07.580> SP<00:03:08.090> 230<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:09.110> actually<00:03:09.530> takes<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.890> huge

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
of koe SP 230 it actually takes a huge

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.140 
of koe SP 230 it actually takes a huge
chunk<00:03:10.400> out<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.090> sp30<00:03:11.870> stamina

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
chunk out of sp30 stamina

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.229 
chunk out of sp30 stamina
and<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:14.349> will<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.159> know<00:03:15.250> usually<00:03:15.730> out<00:03:15.879> spin

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and it will you know usually out spin

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.690 
and it will you know usually out spin
for<00:03:16.480> some<00:03:16.750> whatever<00:03:17.319> reason<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.920> spikes<00:03:18.280> just

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
for some whatever reason the spikes just

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.660 
for some whatever reason the spikes just
I<00:03:19.000> mean<00:03:19.840> spike<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.349> spike<00:03:20.680> contact<00:03:21.129> it<00:03:21.340> sounds

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
I mean spike on spike contact it sounds

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.970 
I mean spike on spike contact it sounds
really<00:03:21.879> weird<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.560> again<00:03:23.560> I'll<00:03:23.890> probably

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
really weird but again I'll probably

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.369 
really weird but again I'll probably
have<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> video<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.700> coming<00:03:25.000> soon<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.629> 3d0<00:03:26.110> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
going and care right off the bat you can

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.960 
going and care right off the bat you can
see<00:03:44.829> they're<00:03:45.190> nice<00:03:46.980> legs<00:03:47.980> definitely<00:03:48.730> want<00:03:48.909> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
see they're nice legs definitely want to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.420 
see they're nice legs definitely want to
launch<00:03:49.239> very<00:03:49.930> very<00:03:50.200> hard<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> very<00:03:50.739> very

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
launch very very hard and very very

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.030 
launch very very hard and very very
accurate<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.379> a<00:03:53.409> little<00:03:53.799> bit<00:03:53.920> more

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
accurate and it is a little bit more

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.740 
accurate and it is a little bit more
tedious<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.579> launch<00:03:54.760> them<00:03:54.970> flash<00:03:55.239> but<00:03:55.569> once

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
tedious to launch them flash but once

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.000 
tedious to launch them flash but once
you<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.049> get<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.409> it<00:03:56.950> does<00:03:57.190> very<00:03:57.700> well
