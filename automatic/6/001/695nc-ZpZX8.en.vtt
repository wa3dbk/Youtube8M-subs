00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
covered in this movie and I don't think

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
covered in this movie and I don't think
you'll<00:00:56.579> fully<00:00:56.820> appreciate<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you'll fully appreciate some of the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.860 
you'll fully appreciate some of the
stuff<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.270> didn't<00:01:00.600> see

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
stuff that go back to if you didn't see

stuff that go back to if you didn't see
the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.829> film<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.059> definitely<00:01:03.510> one

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the first film so this is definitely one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.030 
the first film so this is definitely one
of<00:01:03.809> those<00:01:03.899> movies<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.559> believe<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
