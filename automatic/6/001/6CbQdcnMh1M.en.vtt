00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
fret of the third string lightning uses

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.350 
fret of the third string lightning uses
that<00:03:38.920> chord<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.459> lot<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:39.880> he<00:03:39.970> does<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:42.209> he<00:03:43.209> goes

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
that chord a lot so he does this he goes

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
that chord a lot so he does this he goes
with<00:03:43.540> a7

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
with a7

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.130 
with a7
so<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.489> is<00:03:45.640> an<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.940> seventh<00:03:46.480> chord<00:03:46.660> first

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
strings at the 2nd fret so he does like

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.749 
strings at the 2nd fret so he does like
that<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:47.630> it's<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:47.840> e<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:49.150> 7<00:04:50.150> e

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
that so it's just e a 7 e

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:58.060 
that so it's just e a 7 e
B<00:04:52.759> so<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:54.850> he<00:04:55.850> has<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:55.970> stop<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.770> when<00:04:57.949> he's

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
B so that he has a stop and when he's

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.860 
B so that he has a stop and when he's
singing<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.460> live<00:04:58.699> he<00:04:59.000> kind<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.240> hams<00:04:59.509> it<00:04:59.750> up

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
singing it live he kind of hams it up

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.010 
singing it live he kind of hams it up
and<00:05:00.110> does<00:05:00.259> all<00:05:00.470> these<00:05:00.590> little<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.900> know

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
and does all these little you know

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.900 
and does all these little you know
variations<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.889> tricks<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.250> can<00:05:04.460> pick<00:05:04.699> those

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
variations and tricks you can pick those

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.350 
variations and tricks you can pick those
up<00:05:04.940> if<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.360> want<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:05.750> basically<00:05:06.169> he's<00:05:06.440> just

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
up if you want but basically he's just

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.870 
up if you want but basically he's just
stopping<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.449> guitar<00:05:08.780> playing<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.729> 4<00:05:10.729> beats

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
stopping the guitar playing for 4 beats

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.010 
stopping the guitar playing for 4 beats
so<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:11.930> 1<00:05:12.139> 2<00:05:12.560> 3<00:05:13.039> 4<00:05:13.580> while<00:05:13.880> he's<00:05:14.090> singing<00:05:14.810> the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
so it's 1 2 3 4 while he's singing the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.029 
so it's 1 2 3 4 while he's singing the
first<00:05:15.199> part<00:05:15.470> of<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.620> verse
