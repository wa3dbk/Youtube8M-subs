00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
whereas now although it looks that way

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.039 
whereas now although it looks that way
in<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> video<00:02:14.390> I've<00:02:15.390> only<00:02:15.629> got<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
in the video I've only got the

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.770 
in the video I've only got the
brightness<00:02:16.650> set<00:02:16.890> very<00:02:17.160> low<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.239> go<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
brightness set very low if we go to the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:37.280 
brightness set very low if we go to the
settings<00:02:19.500> menu<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:33.350> there<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:35.959> very<00:02:36.959> little

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
settings menu now there is very little

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.590 
settings menu now there is very little
difference<00:02:40.250> between<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:42.120> brightness<00:02:42.569> level

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
difference between the brightness level

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.759 
difference between the brightness level
I<00:02:44.510> guess<00:02:45.510> depending<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:46.079> what<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.349> display<00:02:46.709> on

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
I guess depending on what you display on

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.860 
I guess depending on what you display on
the<00:02:46.920> screen<00:02:46.950> depends<00:02:47.639> on<00:02:47.730> how<00:02:47.940> irritating

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the screen depends on how irritating

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.170 
the screen depends on how irritating
there's<00:02:49.170> at<00:02:49.290> night<00:02:49.470> also<00:02:50.459> notice<00:02:50.910> there's<00:02:51.090> a
