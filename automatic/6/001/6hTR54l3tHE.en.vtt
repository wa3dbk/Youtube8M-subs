00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.150
 renÃ© 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.569
 but I am a teacher who is very common of 60 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.249
 before anything else is worth saying that the international launch of v60 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.629
 happened in early March and thanks to the tension on the cover we are already 

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:21.079
 being able to show it to you now in the first week of April 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.880
 the of 60 is the input model for the slr cameras of his given substitute of 40 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.740
 and a direct competitor of the company that did not collect sales and alpha 200 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.680
 if I think only of what comes with the kit is not enough to be a nuisance 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.600
 as well as its size which is well consistent with the Mayan cnt 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.510
 besides ally seul 18 55 minutes with opening of the month of 2008 so by 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.600
 ahead 6 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.540
 as ccd sensors resacada is smaller than that of say real image size 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.470
 this law which is equivalent to the truth oma 28 80 millimeters 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.970
 unlike other brands like facing tsunamis and cleaned there 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.690
 completed by adopting the image stabilizer in the mind itself instead of 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.010
 stay in the camera body in practice there is not much difference 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.330
 the camera isight in a building with button searches and we will give easy 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.790
 ecclestone access compact system 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.250
 in addition to the external flash shoe 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.540
 it is worth remembering that it follows with keeping the censor who slid destroying every time 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.730
 that the user you most like the fighter 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.450
 This saves battery power to keep students from the district 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.240
 click 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.310
 as a camera this method of his father the main one does not bring a variety 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.210
 very large of options to take 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 the menu in turn is simple to operate having even an animation 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.260
 interesting 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.150
 This shows that gossip matters as you change the opening. 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.760
 the higher the closed value in physics, the smaller the amount of light 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.520
 the only thing they have a bit of this to do is the application that the public 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 was 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.920
 is that the line for exposure compensation is undefined the signal of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.110
 + was placed on the left 15- on the right 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.849
 a fota words answering service instead of supersport 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.529
 the same thing happens with the analyzed he has the big spring on the right side and 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.259
 even on the left side 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.769
 at the beginning of this month we are going to those who are already accustomed to the format adopted 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.369
 by other brands 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.809
 there are no doubts that this is a first class equipment. 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:27.319
 line 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.629
 10 megapixel resolution or color reproduction I was noticing 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.829
 only the photos have greater sensitivity that by signal can reach up to 3200 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.689
 beginning today 7 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.379
 the one of 60 fogaÃ§a pompÃ©o jotapeg any shaking 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.439
 in format each time both simultaneously 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.889
 one cool thing is that there is software inside the camera itself 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.400
 which allows the return of heavy rains even before you will scales to the 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.189
 computer 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.299
 she writes to sd cards 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.149
 on this lithium battery 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.350
 I'll have more information on the product detailing sheet 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.350
 here on our site 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.769
