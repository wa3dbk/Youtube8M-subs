00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 the six young people to be clear at% i'm not sad i'm working 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.270
 8% and quite a few years in the fascist illustration started 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.490
 as a graphic designer armed for five or six years I focus 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.400
 especially on 1 on the illustration on creating two 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.860
 characters 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.720
 effect% classically a school of that paris the stars of the courts 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.290
 like a very good school 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.290
 I did not like it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.920
 I followed treatments 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.830
 in fact a collective 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.780
 who makes videos particularly 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.950
 is 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.900
 commercial, that is to say commercials 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.950
 for different agencies 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.890
 tonight yesterday we are entering couples every commercial project paper projects 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 personal 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.740
 yes I 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 m 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 other municipalities 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 This folder 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.350
 according to the type of the public exhibition at the piano I chose this title because the space 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 two months is short hope to wear a little one does not make sense that's where 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.060
 the food chain hear 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.310
 hence the survival of different species on the earth 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.349
 but also there 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.129
 the lesson of the food chain without leaning nose 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.019
 that is to say, to be 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.689
 sometimes prisoners or to have three eat or not to make appear 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.379
 and slicing is only one way to food it's rather 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.689
 a conclusion finally through what I see 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.919
 in my daily life and then too bad 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.449
 waiting for afp in time the niouzz reading the press hoping in 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.170
 seeing people how do you how do people live ie 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.790
 by appear and consumption competition announces a company of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.349
 profusion 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.040
 and that sometimes to vauban ii from time to time that one can be there also 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.229
 an hour near rarity not reported 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.909
 in relation to the problems of water and food will particularly terra 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.909
 this moment 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.200
 saturday september 17th if the score may seem a bit like the image here it's 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.120
 still enough 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.179
 m a common destiny 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.689
 as a logo 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.909
 that is to say, the very simple train 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.120
 5 it can hardly be simpler it's pretty colorful too 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.999
 with a childish side 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.599
 % and at the same time what is interesting is little 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.599
 contrast between the childish side b 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.099
 of some of the visual eliot sometimes the side 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.359
 a little more 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.209
 adults 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.639
 we can say the message 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.989
 apart from had people consider it a bit too thinking one year I do not 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 do not know too vague for example johan padan right from gary newman bush could 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.459
 wirelessly show later that people I love people in this text is only 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.989
 not very very serious rn12 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.089
 no doubt 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.089
 of all 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.809
 without a doubt 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.809
 ap 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:07.139
 Yesterday at sion she came from curiosity this curious about full of 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.749
 areas at 24 years old the good idea on arrival to gather snow removal 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.309
 he should not be together 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:18.139
 sacred in hand something interesting so for that it takes 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.349
 develop its antennas and the very nice listening 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.159
 it's not about staying alone thinking and looking at the 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.159
 ceiling it will work it's not done on purpose 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:29.830
 gesture 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 ap 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.939
 v 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.129
 m 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.270
 p 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.370
 I enjoy drawing a character in this or that position 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.790
 and then I did find the element 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.249
 % text 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.990
 for another element that will create equality 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.160
 either sometimes I start parenting there again to smoke looking on 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.270
 internet i'm taking pieces 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.490
 the text 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.069
 I make lists 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.360
 they emit side 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.809
 and then I will have I see the complaints of the ends and full of texts 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.599
 and I try to make it coincide both 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.659
 it is well illustrated by afp 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.439
 if like to bercy there is only the text 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.370
 his image 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.699
 it does not really matter 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.969
 it's good for him everyone knows he knows as well in india 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.849
 I went back to the picture that the technique list not 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.120
 it's not very interesting either 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.499
 no matter but that's all that's good it's the two connected 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.129
 this year I would like to do 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.009
 a little too pronounced 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.029
 to explain to people 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.439
 it's a manual and inhumane wool for aliens 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.869
 by giving tower common points 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.449
 explanations to things that are totally 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.409
 staggered tote and women info e1 stuff that a priori is extremely 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.419
 sea ​​claim 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.599
 in this case can not really for them 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.860
 just for that 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.440
 finally a very easy thing and polokwane
