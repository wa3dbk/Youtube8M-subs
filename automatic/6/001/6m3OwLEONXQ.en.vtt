00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
like this and usually I was thinking I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.140 
like this and usually I was thinking I
would<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.610> about<00:02:41.760> wearing<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:43.620> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
would think about wearing this just to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.800 
would think about wearing this just to
you<00:02:45.150> know<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> supermarket<00:02:46.800> or<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:48.569> the

you know to the supermarket or to the
store<00:02:49.140> or<00:02:49.500> whatnot<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> long<00:02:51.270> pieces<00:02:51.660> can

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
store or whatnot so the long pieces can

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.360 
store or whatnot so the long pieces can
go<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> side<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.819> this

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
go to the side like this

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.040 
go to the side like this
and<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.700> your<00:02:56.849> look<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.269> that's<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
and this is your look and that's it and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.970 
and this is your look and that's it and
how<00:02:58.920> old<00:02:59.519> about<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.180> long<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:01.530> was<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.769> five

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
seconds ten seconds and that's it so I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.210 
seconds ten seconds and that's it so I
would<00:03:06.660> say<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.049> about<00:03:07.080> A<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.530> B<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.100> they

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
would say this is about A to B but they

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.789 
would say this is about A to B but they
call<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> dark<00:03:08.819> brown<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:10.560> light
