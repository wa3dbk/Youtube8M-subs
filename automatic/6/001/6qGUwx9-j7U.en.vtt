ends together to cover the dowel as you
can<00:01:38.439> see<00:01:38.619> here<00:01:38.950> i<00:01:39.159> will<00:01:39.700> line<00:01:40.179> up<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.659> blue

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
can see here i will line up the blue

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.199 
can see here i will line up the blue
lines<00:01:41.109> it<00:01:41.469> just<00:01:42.099> means<00:01:42.249> there's<00:01:42.520> no<00:01:42.579> twist<00:01:42.969> in

the<00:01:43.329> whole<00:01:43.450> loop<00:01:43.599> the<00:01:44.409> next<00:01:44.709> step<00:01:44.859> is<00:01:45.099> to<00:01:45.219> take

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
the whole loop the next step is to take

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.879 
the whole loop the next step is to take
our<00:01:45.639> electrical<00:01:46.149> tape<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.509> wrap<00:01:47.380> some<00:01:47.619> around

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
our electrical tape and wrap some around

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.159 
our electrical tape and wrap some around
about<00:01:48.279> one<00:01:48.639> inch<00:01:48.880> over<00:01:49.389> the<00:01:49.479> join<00:01:49.719> on<00:01:49.990> the

about one inch over the join on the
planet

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.990 

this<00:01:56.620> will<00:01:56.830> ensure<00:01:56.980> that<00:01:57.340> your<00:01:57.520> hula<00:01:57.760> hoop

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
this will ensure that your hula hoop

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.920 
this will ensure that your hula hoop
does<00:01:58.240> not<00:01:58.390> come<00:01:58.600> undone<00:01:59.020> while<00:01:59.770> you're<00:02:00.070> 12

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.380 

now<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> basis<00:02:14.549> for<00:02:14.939> your<00:02:15.090> very<00:02:15.299> own

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
now you have the basis for your very own

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.289 
now you have the basis for your very own
blue<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.950> make<00:02:20.099> your<00:02:20.280> home<00:02:20.489> unique<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.150> a
