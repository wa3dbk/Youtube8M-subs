so right here they're calling out a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.419 
so right here they're calling out a
bogey<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.630> 10<00:00:27.900> o'clock<00:00:28.019> hi<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.920> Mission

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
bogey at 10 o'clock hi to Mission

00:00:29.429 --> 00:01:00.869 
bogey at 10 o'clock hi to Mission
Control<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.570> let's<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.929> pay<00:00:31.109> attention

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.810 

hey<00:01:01.600> he's<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:02.890> get<00:01:03.039> we<00:01:03.370> had<00:01:03.489> somebody<00:01:03.670> on

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
hey he's and we get we had somebody on

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.890 
hey he's and we get we had somebody on
the<00:01:03.969> front<00:01:04.180> window<00:01:04.330> would<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.689> paired

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
the front window would have paired

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.350 
the front window would have paired
binoculars<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.009> azulon<00:01:06.640> trying<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.180> get<00:01:07.330> a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
binoculars and a azulon trying to get a

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.469 
binoculars and a azulon trying to get a
pretty<00:01:07.689> good<00:01:07.840> idea<00:01:08.140> on<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.380> thing<00:01:09.420> let<00:01:10.420> me

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
pretty good idea on this thing let me

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:18.300 
pretty good idea on this thing let me
copy<00:01:10.659> that

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.300 

okay<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.830> know<00:01:20.890> if<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.040> guys<00:01:21.190> this

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
okay the I don't know if you guys this

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
okay the I don't know if you guys this
joke<00:01:21.549> shot<00:01:21.940> than<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.180> was<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.510> camera

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.840 

right<00:01:26.140> here<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:26.980> were<00:01:27.040> trying<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.400> focus

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
right here they were trying to focus

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.850 
right here they were trying to focus
their<00:01:28.060> camera<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> space<00:01:29.170> station<00:01:29.650> so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
their camera in on the space station so

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.650 
their camera in on the space station so
when<00:01:30.040> they<00:01:30.130> swung<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.580> over<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.060> object<00:01:31.510> it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
when they swung it over to the object it

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.300 
when they swung it over to the object it
would<00:01:31.750> be<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.110> focus<00:01:32.530> with<00:01:32.680> no<00:01:32.860> fumbling

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
would be in focus with no fumbling

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.840 
would be in focus with no fumbling
around<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:35.170> transmission<00:01:35.680> cut<00:01:36.070> now<00:01:36.820> we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
around and the transmission cut now we

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.760 
around and the transmission cut now we
have<00:01:37.210> Mission<00:01:37.570> Control<00:01:37.870> coming<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.500> talking

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
have Mission Control coming on talking

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.590 
have Mission Control coming on talking
about<00:01:39.040> they're<00:01:39.460> losing<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:40.090> they're<00:01:40.390> losing

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
about they're losing this they're losing

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.230 
about they're losing this they're losing
all<00:01:40.840> these<00:01:41.020> different<00:01:41.410> telemetry<00:01:41.860> x'<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.310> it

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
all these different telemetry x' and it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.300 
all these different telemetry x' and it
wasn't<00:01:43.570> all<00:01:43.900> at<00:01:44.050> once<00:01:44.290> they<00:01:44.560> didn't<00:01:44.860> lose<00:01:45.010> all

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
wasn't all at once they didn't lose all

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.140 
wasn't all at once they didn't lose all
telemetry<00:01:46.000> all<00:01:46.480> at<00:01:46.870> once<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.380> didn't<00:01:47.680> just

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
telemetry all at once it didn't just

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.460 
telemetry all at once it didn't just
explode<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.180> one<00:01:49.360> Big<00:01:49.750> Bang<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.320> was

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
explode in one Big Bang there was

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.710 
explode in one Big Bang there was
multiple<00:01:50.920> explosions<00:01:51.400> throughout<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.210> ship

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
multiple explosions throughout the ship

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.950 
multiple explosions throughout the ship
because<00:01:53.230> things<00:01:53.530> were<00:01:53.680> failing<00:01:54.960> seconds

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
because things were failing seconds

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.720 
because things were failing seconds
apart<00:01:56.260> from<00:01:56.500> each<00:01:56.650> other<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.280> when<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.550> get

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
apart from each other and when we get

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.950 
apart from each other and when we get
the<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.030> let<00:01:58.210> when<00:01:58.360> we're<00:01:58.510> getting<00:01:58.630> telemetry

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
the to let when we're getting telemetry

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.320 
the to let when we're getting telemetry
we<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.680> tell<00:01:59.860> down<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.400> nanosecond<00:02:00.760> what

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
we can tell down to the nanosecond what

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.000 
we can tell down to the nanosecond what
happened<00:02:01.750> right<00:02:01.990> up<00:02:02.140> until<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.530> point<00:02:02.770> where

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
happened right up until the point where

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.280 
happened right up until the point where
they<00:02:03.100> ended<00:02:03.280> up<00:02:03.520> until<00:02:04.360> where<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.750> telemetry

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
they ended up until where the telemetry

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.560 
they ended up until where the telemetry
stops<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.700> let's<00:02:06.910> listen<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.300> everything

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
stops so let's listen to everything

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.660 
stops so let's listen to everything
that's<00:02:07.870> being<00:02:08.020> said<00:02:08.140> here<00:02:08.710> and<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.190> want<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.580> to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that's being said here and I want you to

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.430 
that's being said here and I want you to
really<00:02:09.910> pay<00:02:10.030> attention<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.810> video<00:02:10.990> guys

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
really pay attention to this video guys

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.260 
really pay attention to this video guys
because<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.610> type<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.820> video<00:02:13.210> that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
because this is the type of video that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.240 
because this is the type of video that
I'm<00:02:13.510> talking<00:02:13.750> about<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.590> means<00:02:14.800> all<00:02:15.040> my

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
I'm talking about that means all my

we<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.350> lost<00:02:23.740> tire<00:02:24.720> pressure<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.990> left

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
we just lost tire pressure on left

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.560 
we just lost tire pressure on left
