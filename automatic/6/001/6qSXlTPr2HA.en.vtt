00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:08.250
Hello. My name's Benjamin. I'm a teacher on
this website, obviously, for engVid. And today

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.035
we're going to deal with talking on the phone
and trying to understand what they are saying.

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:24.130
We're going to ask them to raise their voices,
to slow down, we're going to ask them to repeat

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.516
themselves, and we're going to cover what
to do when you just don't understand.

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:44.751
So, I'm hungry. I've been working all day. I
need to call a pizza. That's it. Okay. Huh?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.840
I can't hear them. They're being too quiet.
They're quiet as a mouse. So I need to say:

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.190
"Could you speak a little louder please?"
Okay? So: "Could", this is a polite way of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:09.190
asking a question. Okay? "Yeah, hang on. I'm...
Sorry. I'm just talking to my friends on the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.810
internet. Okay? Hang on. I'll be a couple of
minutes." So this is a polite way of speaking.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.560
"Could you speak a little louder?" A little,
a little louder. Okay? "Please? Could you

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.500
speak a little louder please?"

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:33.063
Or another way of saying this: "Sorry, what
did you say?" I didn't hear what they said.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:39.580
So this is interesting. Look at the word order,
here. "What did you say?" I put my auxiliary

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:48.014
verb "did", "What did you say?" before the
subject, here. "Sorry, what did you say?"

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.019
I'm asking them to repeat. Okay?

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:58.710
Or, last one: "Please speak up." Please. A
little louder. I need to hear. "Please speak

00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:07.113
up." Speak up. Okay? If you don't remember
anything else: "speak up" is more volume.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:13.400
Okay? "Please speak up. I can't hear you very
well." "I can't", so this obviously short

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.069
for: "I cannot hear you very well." I'll just
tell him. "Sorry, please speak up. I can't

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.197
hear you very well." Okay, he's speaking
nice and loudly now, I can hear him.

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:34.801
But now he's talking too fast, he's saying:
"Blablablablablablablablablablablablabla."

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:41.169
That's no good. "Yeah. No, hang on. I need
to talk to them again. Sorry." So, if I need

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:50.417
to tell them to calm down, to slow down-okay?-I
could say: "I'm struggling to understand.

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:56.510
Please could you speak slower?" Okay? I've
written... This is optional, this bit: "I'm

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.480
struggling". So struggling, that fight, I'm
fighting to understand. You're just talking

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.974
too fast. But if you want to keep it nice and
simple, just say: "Please could you speak

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.510
slower?" Slower. Slow, a little bit more slow.
Okay? Got it? "I'm sorry. I'm struggling to

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.382
understand. Please could
you speak slower?"

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.299
Great, so now they're talking nice and loudly
and they're talking slowly, which is what

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:41.010
we want. I can understand now. "Huh? What?
Huh?" They said something. I... I didn't...

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.809
I didn't... I didn't understand, so I say...
"Yeah. One minute." "Sorry, would you mind

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:56.019
repeating that?" Okay? This is another polite
way of phrasing: "Would you mind? Do you mind?"

00:03:55.993 --> 00:04:03.187
It's a nice way of asking someone to do something.
Repeating, "repeat" with "ing" that, what

00:04:03.213 --> 00:04:10.080
they just said. Okay? We'll try this. "Sorry.
Would you mind repeating that please?" Busy,

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:14.555
oh they're very busy at the moment.
Okay, that's fine.

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:23.558
This pizza company, I don't understand what
they're saying again. What's going on? So...

00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:29.244
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. One sec. One sec." So I
need to say: "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:38.084
that." Okay? So: "I'm sorry", so short for: "I
am sorry, I didn't"-didn't - did not-"quite"

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.660
not quite, just a little bit... "I didn't
quite catch", catch, if I catch something,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.563
I understand, I get it. "I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't quite catch that." Okay? "Catch"

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:55.520
means to understand, to hear. "I'm
sorry, I didn't quite catch that."

00:04:56.082 --> 00:05:07.010
"Did you say that you...? Did you say that
you only do vegetarian pizzas?" Okay? "Did

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.853
you say that...?" So I am... I am now repeating
what they said. "Did you say...?" okay? Past

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:23.258
simple. You did. "Did you say...?" But with...
This is the auxiliary again. "Did you say

00:05:23.258 --> 00:05:34.258
that you only do vegetarian peache-, pizzas?"
Or I could say: "Let me just check that. You

00:05:34.284 --> 00:05:44.582
said that you only do vegetarian pizzas. Is
that right?" Okay? So I'm checking. "Is that

00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:54.238
right?" Is that what you said? Okay? "Yes.
Sorry, sir. We only do vegetarian pizzas."

00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:58.903
Okay? And then I can choose vegetarian and
I say: "Yes", or I say: "No", and I choose

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:00.843
someone else. Okay?

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:08.950
So I hope that gives you a better idea of how to
really understand your telephone conversations.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:16.810
Okay? Just to recap: we got ways of asking
them to raise the volume a little, to slow

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.500
down, to repeat themselves, and what to do if
you think they'd said something but you're

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.338
not quite sure.

00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:32.930
Okay, if this is in a business context and
you know the person, you could just write

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:44.026
them an email to say: "Hello, Mr. Toogood.
We had a conversation yesterday. Did you say

00:06:44.052 --> 00:06:51.370
that you will come and see me tomorrow?" So
you could write an email to check the meaning

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.119
of the conversation.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:58.670
