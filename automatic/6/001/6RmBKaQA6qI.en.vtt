00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 coffee sold under system 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 fair trade since it leaves the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.880
 producer organization is being 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.609
 traced until the toaster arrives 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.039
 as well as us 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.650
 they do auditing as an organization of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.620
 producers are also audited by 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.110
 certified fair trade companies and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 that makes the system fully go 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.930
 guaranteed on transparency not 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.640
 only economic but also of 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.680
 all the conditions that have to do 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 respect for the environment with the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.640
 human rights 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.039
 I'm going to tell you before there was 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.530
 fair trade for us will be more 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.780
 hard 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.960
 because the plantations were older 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.690
 and less produced through trade 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.050
 we have just learned 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 to fertilize to change plants 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.300
 we have tried to change plants by 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.510
 new ways 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.630
 and they have and it has cost less less 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.620
 the plants because for the prize of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.620
 fair Trade
