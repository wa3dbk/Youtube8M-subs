00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
hey guys is quickie baby bringing you a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.540 
hey guys is quickie baby bringing you a
new<00:00:14.299> 7.5<00:00:15.299> bat<00:00:15.659> port<00:00:16.199> which<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.279> meant<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.519> be

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
new 7.5 bat port which is meant to be

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.650 
new 7.5 bat port which is meant to be
situated<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.449> North<00:00:18.689> American<00:00:19.230> city<00:00:20.660> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
situated in a North American city the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.540 
situated in a North American city the
map<00:00:21.839> is<00:00:22.369> rather<00:00:23.369> large<00:00:23.789> by<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> fielding

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
map is rather large by the fielding

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.009 
map is rather large by the fielding
there's<00:00:26.550> lots<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.849> indestructible<00:00:27.300> cover<00:00:27.810> as

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
there's lots of indestructible cover as

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.569 
there's lots of indestructible cover as
can<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.349> seen<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.339> quite

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
can be seen here which is quite

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
can be seen here which is quite
surprising<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.890> it's<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> cap<00:00:32.490> circle<00:00:33.290> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
surprising as it's in the cap circle so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.570 
surprising as it's in the cap circle so
there<00:00:34.410> should<00:00:34.560> be<00:00:34.590> opportunity<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.400> people

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
there should be opportunity for people

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:43.720 
there should be opportunity for people
to<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:36.060> that<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.540> avoid<00:00:36.660> fire<00:00:37.200> while<00:00:37.500> camping

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.130 

so<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> south<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> north<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> map

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so the south and the north of the map

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.610 
so the south and the north of the map
are<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:47.370> heavily<00:00:47.730> built<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.300> building<00:00:48.780> areas

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.460 

which<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.489> learnt<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.210> there's<00:00:55.140> quite

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
which have to be learnt as there's quite

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.040 
which have to be learnt as there's quite
a<00:00:55.500> few<00:00:55.620> gaps<00:00:56.040> which<00:00:56.720> between<00:00:57.720> some<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
a few gaps which between some of the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
a few gaps which between some of the
buildings<00:00:58.550> but<00:00:59.550> some<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> areas<00:01:00.300> are

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
buildings but some of the areas are

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
buildings but some of the areas are
completely<00:01:00.870> closed<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.650> can't<00:01:02.070> be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
completely closed off and can't be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
completely closed off and can't be
flanked<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.360> knowing<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> map<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.650> will<00:01:05.009> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
flanked so knowing this map well will be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.640 
flanked so knowing this map well will be
paramount<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> after<00:01:06.869> playing<00:01:07.259> this<00:01:07.380> math<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
paramount so after playing this math a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.630 
paramount so after playing this math a
few<00:01:08.070> times<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:09.180> keeps<00:01:09.420> reminding<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.020> events

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
few times it keeps reminding the events

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.990 
few times it keeps reminding the events
with<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.850> heavily<00:01:12.300> built<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.750> area

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
with a heavily built up area

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
with a heavily built up area
stereotypical<00:01:15.000> train<00:01:15.240> tracks<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.680> open

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
stereotypical train tracks and an open

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
stereotypical train tracks and an open
area<00:01:17.340> which<00:01:17.670> allows<00:01:18.030> passing<00:01:18.630> shots<00:01:20.660> so<00:01:21.660> I'm

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
area which allows passing shots so I'm

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.960 
area which allows passing shots so I'm
playing<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.170> map<00:01:22.440> with<00:01:22.920> viewers<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.940> my

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
playing this map with viewers of my

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.650 
playing this map with viewers of my
livestream<00:01:25.759> we<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:26.850> explore<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.539> together

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
livestream we will explore it together

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.219 
livestream we will explore it together
and<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:29.039> were<00:01:29.220> having<00:01:29.460> discussion<00:01:30.330> about<00:01:30.660> what

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and we were having discussion about what

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.880 
and we were having discussion about what
we<00:01:31.350> thought<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.440> see<00:01:37.649> here

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
we thought about it so we can see here

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.790 
we thought about it so we can see here
we're<00:01:38.039> going<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.560> southeastern<00:01:40.560> part

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
we're going into the southeastern part

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.899 
we're going into the southeastern part
of<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.039> map<00:01:41.630> which<00:01:42.630> looks<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.909> aggregate

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of the map which looks like a aggregate

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.650 
of the map which looks like a aggregate
dumping<00:01:45.840> ground<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:47.729> provides<00:01:48.090> undulations

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
dumping ground it provides undulations

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.190 
dumping ground it provides undulations
and<00:01:49.319> some<00:01:50.190> cover<00:01:50.520> from<00:01:50.940> range<00:01:51.330> but<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:51.899> cover

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and some cover from range but no cover

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.279 
and some cover from range but no cover
from<00:01:52.410> artillery<00:01:53.509> quite<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.539> few<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.989> medium

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
from artillery quite a few of the medium

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.800 
from artillery quite a few of the medium
tanks<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.920> rush<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.729> fight<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.660> out

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
tanks like to rush here and fight it out

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.900 
tanks like to rush here and fight it out
I'm<00:01:58.289> not<00:01:58.500> sure<00:01:58.709> if<00:01:58.830> that's<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.280> because<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
I'm not sure if that's just because the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.570 
I'm not sure if that's just because the
color<00:02:00.239> that<00:02:00.599> is<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.140> mini-map<00:02:01.459> and<00:02:02.459> on<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
color that is on the mini-map and on a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.460 
color that is on the mini-map and on a
test<00:02:02.849> server<00:02:03.119> Noah<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.959> knows<00:02:04.200> where<00:02:04.410> to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
test server Noah really knows where to

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.669 
test server Noah really knows where to
go<00:02:04.739> yet<00:02:06.020> yeah<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.229> should<00:02:07.349> be<00:02:07.470> some

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
go yet yeah there should be some

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.029 
go yet yeah there should be some
interesting<00:02:08.160> spots<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> camp<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.380> stop

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
interesting spots to camp here and stop

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.760 
interesting spots to camp here and stop
people<00:02:11.459> from<00:02:11.580> coming<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.900> open<00:02:13.290> part<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
people from coming over the open part of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550 
people from coming over the open part of
the<00:02:13.890> map<00:02:14.069> over<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.940> train<00:02:15.180> tracks<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.379> we

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the map over the train tracks so as we

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.860 
the map over the train tracks so as we
can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.739> here<00:02:17.060> you're<00:02:18.060> able<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.390> shoot<00:02:18.599> from

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
can see here you're able to shoot from

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440 
can see here you're able to shoot from
one<00:02:19.170> end<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> other<00:02:20.270> obviously<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
one end to the other obviously with the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.350 
one end to the other obviously with the
limitation<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.170> new<00:02:22.379> range<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.879> will<00:02:24.150> be

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
limitation of new range so this will be

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.059 
limitation of new range so this will be
a<00:02:24.390> choke<00:02:24.840> point<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> map

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
a choke point on the map

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.390 
a choke point on the map
or<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.790> least<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:27.180> death<00:02:27.719> pass<00:02:27.989> where<00:02:28.530> we're

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
or at least a death pass where we're

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.250 
or at least a death pass where we're
going<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.640> take<00:02:30.060> fire<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> want<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.109> try

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
going to take fire if you want to try

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.830 
going to take fire if you want to try
and<00:02:31.379> cross<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.159> haven't<00:02:32.840> whittled

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and cross it if you haven't whittled

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.860 
and cross it if you haven't whittled
down<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.170> enemy<00:02:34.409> enough<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:36.299> then<00:02:36.389> we<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.659> see

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
down the enemy enough so then we can see

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.280 
down the enemy enough so then we can see
there's<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.230> lot<00:02:37.499> of<00:02:37.530> heart<00:02:37.980> rail<00:02:38.489> trains

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
there's a lot of heart rail trains

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.429 
there's a lot of heart rail trains
dividing<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.439> North<00:02:40.739> base<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:43.170> should<00:02:43.349> be

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
dividing up the North base we should be

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.050 
dividing up the North base we should be
very<00:02:43.620> interesting<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:44.340> try<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.790> break

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
very interesting to try and break

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.590 
very interesting to try and break
through

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.050 

the<00:02:53.140> whole<00:02:53.290> Maps<00:02:53.500> got<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.770> quite<00:02:54.490> an<00:02:54.640> authentic

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
the whole Maps got a quite an authentic

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.810 
the whole Maps got a quite an authentic
feel<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.770> although<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:57.100> still<00:02:57.220> reminds<00:02:57.700> me

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
feel to it although it still reminds me

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.660 
feel to it although it still reminds me
events<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:59.260> very<00:02:59.470> much<00:02:59.770> its<00:03:00.010> own<00:03:00.130> map<00:03:00.340> within

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
events it's very much its own map within

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.070 
events it's very much its own map within
his<00:03:00.880> own<00:03:00.970> right<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:03.070> can<00:03:03.220> see<00:03:03.460> that<00:03:03.670> these

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
his own right here we can see that these

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.530 
his own right here we can see that these
pipes<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.790> unbreakable<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.240> should<00:03:07.420> provide

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
should be very interesting places to

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.530 
should be very interesting places to
camp<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.209> protect<00:03:23.390> your<00:03:23.840> store<00:03:25.180> as<00:03:26.180> well

some<00:03:30.800> nice<00:03:30.980> undulations<00:03:31.519> here<00:03:31.910> which<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.239> can

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
some nice undulations here which you can

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.220 
some nice undulations here which you can

artillery are going to go on this map

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.150 
artillery are going to go on this map
I'm<00:03:37.879> not<00:03:38.060> quite<00:03:38.510> certain<00:03:38.810> they<00:03:39.739> might<00:03:39.920> just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
I'm not quite certain they might just

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.130 
I'm not quite certain they might just
chill<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.430> base<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.150> hopefully<00:03:41.900> there<00:03:42.080> will

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
chill in base and hopefully there will

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.869 
chill in base and hopefully there will
be<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.319> line<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.739> scouts<00:03:43.040> trying<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.549> keep<00:03:43.730> an

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
be a line of scouts trying to keep an

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.949 
be a line of scouts trying to keep an
eye<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.360> them<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.239> generally<00:03:50.780> what<00:03:50.900> I

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
eye out for them so generally what I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.559 
eye out for them so generally what I
found<00:03:51.230> guys<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.280> people<00:03:52.970> who<00:03:53.120> spawn<00:03:53.450> at

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
found guys is the people who spawn at

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.470 
found guys is the people who spawn at
the<00:03:53.660> North<00:03:53.900> start<00:03:54.530> by<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:54.890> west<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.640> people

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the North start by going west and people

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.569 
the North start by going west and people
who<00:03:56.630> spawn<00:03:56.930> at<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.200> South<00:03:57.500> start<00:03:58.190> by<00:03:58.400> going

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
who spawn at the South start by going

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.300 
who spawn at the South start by going
east<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.840> what<00:04:00.049> happens<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.560> people<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.130> North

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
east so what happens is people the North

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.039 
east so what happens is people the North
follow<00:04:01.579> this<00:04:01.910> kind<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.480> general<00:04:02.660> route

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
follow this kind of a general route

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.390 
follow this kind of a general route
where<00:04:03.230> they<00:04:03.319> go<00:04:03.470> west<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:03.950> then<00:04:04.069> they<00:04:04.220> go

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
where they go west and then they go

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.360 
where they go west and then they go
south<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.970> get<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> opposition<00:04:05.810> space

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
south to get to the opposition space

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.500 
south to get to the opposition space
where<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.549> generally<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.150> people<00:04:08.390> at<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
where is generally the people at the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.140 
where is generally the people at the
South<00:04:08.690> go<00:04:08.930> east<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.410> then<00:04:09.620> north<00:04:09.980> across<00:04:10.970> the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
South go east and then north across the

South go east and then north across the
train<00:04:11.360> tracks<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.110> initially<00:04:12.530> saw<00:04:12.709> that

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
train tracks like you initially saw that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.339 
train tracks like you initially saw that
seems<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.849> be<00:04:13.879> how<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.629> played<00:04:14.870> out<00:04:14.900> on<00:04:15.079> the

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
seems to be how it played out on the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.409 
seems to be how it played out on the
test<00:04:15.590> server<00:04:15.769> I'm<00:04:16.370> sure<00:04:16.669> that<00:04:16.850> as<00:04:16.970> smarter

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
test server I'm sure that as smarter

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.240 
test server I'm sure that as smarter
players<00:04:17.690> see<00:04:18.019> this<00:04:18.199> realize<00:04:18.739> list<00:04:19.070> and

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
players see this realize list and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.409 
players see this realize list and
they're<00:04:19.340> going<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.489> try<00:04:19.699> and<00:04:19.729> get<00:04:19.940> into<00:04:20.060> good

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
they're going to try and get into good

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.360 
they're going to try and get into good
counter<00:04:21.049> positions<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.680> try<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.010> hold<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
counter positions to try and hold the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.900 
counter positions to try and hold the
locations<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.150> stop<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.570> enemy's<00:04:23.840> advance<00:04:24.910> so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
locations to stop the enemy's advance so

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.810 
locations to stop the enemy's advance so
now<00:04:26.060> we're<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.389> built-up<00:04:26.810> town<00:04:27.139> area<00:04:27.820> we

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
now we're in the built-up town area we

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.580 
now we're in the built-up town area we
can<00:04:28.970> see<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.419> surrounding<00:04:29.930> skyline<00:04:30.440> is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
can see the surrounding skyline is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.370 
can see the surrounding skyline is
filled<00:04:30.889> by<00:04:31.510> tower<00:04:32.510> blocks<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.110> skyscrapers

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
filled by tower blocks and skyscrapers

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.860 
filled by tower blocks and skyscrapers
whatever<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.190> want<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.400> call<00:04:34.520> them

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.130 

so<00:04:39.470> again<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:39.980> town<00:04:40.370> needs<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.850> be<00:04:40.970> learnt<00:04:41.240> as

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
so again this town needs to be learnt as

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.860 
so again this town needs to be learnt as
there<00:04:42.440> are<00:04:42.530> quite<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:42.980> few<00:04:43.160> areas<00:04:43.610> which<00:04:44.150> cannot

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
there are quite a few areas which cannot

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.990 
there are quite a few areas which cannot
be<00:04:45.050> passed<00:04:45.290> through<00:04:47.770> for<00:04:48.770> example<00:04:49.160> here<00:04:52.000> it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
be passed through for example here it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.190 
be passed through for example here it
looks<00:04:53.210> like<00:04:53.330> there<00:04:53.600> should<00:04:53.720> have<00:04:53.780> been<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.990> way

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
looks like there should have been a way

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.570 
looks like there should have been a way
through<00:04:54.530> here<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:54.950> there<00:04:55.070> isn't<00:04:57.520> try<00:04:58.520> to

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
through here but there isn't try to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.480 
through here but there isn't try to
destroy<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> building<00:04:59.300> just<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.840> test<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.320> out

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.420 

so<00:05:06.090> this<00:05:06.509> gap<00:05:07.199> coming<00:05:07.710> up<00:05:07.830> here<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.069> think<00:05:08.190> is

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
so this gap coming up here I think is

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.219 
so this gap coming up here I think is
going<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.669> be<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.789> key<00:05:09.060> choke<00:05:09.330> point<00:05:09.599> because

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
going to be a key choke point because

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.689 
going to be a key choke point because
quite<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.530> lot<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.800> people<00:05:11.160> are<00:05:11.430> going<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.610> get

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
quite a lot of people are going to get

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.260 
quite a lot of people are going to get
funneled<00:05:12.000> through<00:05:12.330> here<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:14.090> think<00:05:15.090> this<00:05:15.210> is

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
funneled through here I think this is

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.350 
funneled through here I think this is
one<00:05:15.539> of<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.840> only<00:05:16.020> breaches<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.889> in<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
one of the only breaches in in the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.230 
one of the only breaches in in the
building<00:05:19.169> line<00:05:19.639> coming<00:05:20.639> out<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:20.970> choke<00:05:21.210> point

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
building line coming out the choke point

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.520 
building line coming out the choke point
you<00:05:21.599> get<00:05:21.720> quite<00:05:22.020> nice<00:05:22.440> cover<00:05:22.800> from<00:05:23.069> that<00:05:23.220> mast

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
you get quite nice cover from that mast

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.939 
you get quite nice cover from that mast
the<00:05:25.530> base<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.009> mast<00:05:26.160> then<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:27.800> again<00:05:28.800> we

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
the base of the mast then and again we

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:36.500 
the base of the mast then and again we
have<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.190> open<00:05:29.639> air<00:05:29.789> of<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.030> train<00:05:30.270> tracks

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.840 

so<00:05:37.510> now<00:05:37.690> we<00:05:37.750> have<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.110> greenery<00:05:38.610> green<00:05:39.610> part

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
so now we have the greenery green part

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.610 
so now we have the greenery green part
of<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.090> map<00:05:40.240> coming<00:05:40.570> up<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:41.200> we<00:05:41.350> see<00:05:41.590> that

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
of the map coming up and we see that

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.890 
of the map coming up and we see that
there's<00:05:41.890> a<00:05:41.950> bridge<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.670> bypasses<00:05:43.630> all<00:05:43.720> of

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
there's a bridge the bypasses all of

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.650 
there's a bridge the bypasses all of
that<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.230> allow<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.680> cross<00:05:44.890> over<00:05:45.660> however

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
that to allow you to cross over however

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.020 
that to allow you to cross over however
from<00:05:47.290> what<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.500> found<00:05:47.770> on<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.130> test<00:05:48.790> service

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
from what I found on the test service

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.550 
from what I found on the test service
the<00:05:49.360> bridges<00:05:49.720> are<00:05:49.750> death<00:05:50.050> traps<00:05:50.080> as<00:05:51.090> you

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
the bridges are death traps as you

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.320 
the bridges are death traps as you
instantly<00:05:53.560> become<00:05:53.740> vulnerable<00:05:54.190> to<00:05:54.550> fire<00:05:54.940> from

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
instantly become vulnerable to fire from

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.870 
instantly become vulnerable to fire from
both<00:05:55.930> sides<00:05:56.320> up<00:05:56.680> onto<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.160> bridge<00:05:57.370> as<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.700> can

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
both sides up onto the bridge as you can

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.030 
both sides up onto the bridge as you can
see<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.300> railings<00:05:58.780> are<00:05:59.110> not<00:05:59.740> very<00:05:59.920> high

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
see that the railings are not very high

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.640 
see that the railings are not very high
so<00:06:00.940> unless<00:06:01.150> your<00:06:01.390> tank<00:06:01.660> is<00:06:01.870> incredibly<00:06:02.470> low

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
so unless your tank is incredibly low

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.240 
so unless your tank is incredibly low
profile<00:06:03.190> like<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:04.230> ELC<00:06:05.230> tier<00:06:05.560> 5<00:06:05.860> French

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
profile like that ELC tier 5 French

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.060 
profile like that ELC tier 5 French
Scout<00:06:06.610> tank<00:06:07.170> then<00:06:08.170> you're<00:06:08.800> going<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.010> take

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
Scout tank then you're going to take

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.610 
Scout tank then you're going to take
massive<00:06:09.790> fire<00:06:10.210> from<00:06:11.080> your<00:06:11.260> left<00:06:11.410> and<00:06:11.560> your

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
massive fire from your left and your

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.550 
massive fire from your left and your
right<00:06:11.710> as<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:12.100> cross<00:06:13.110> however<00:06:14.110> if<00:06:14.230> you<00:06:14.350> do

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
right as you cross however if you do

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.830 
right as you cross however if you do
manage<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.920> cross<00:06:15.250> maybe<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:15.790> a<00:06:15.880> blitz<00:06:16.150> using<00:06:16.690> a

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
manage to cross maybe in a blitz using a

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.760 
manage to cross maybe in a blitz using a
fast<00:06:17.380> tank<00:06:17.860> or<00:06:18.130> a<00:06:18.160> couple<00:06:18.880> of<00:06:19.000> mediums<00:06:19.770> then

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
fast tank or a couple of mediums then

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.030 
fast tank or a couple of mediums then
you<00:06:20.980> have<00:06:21.190> great<00:06:21.550> flanking<00:06:22.180> opportunities<00:06:23.040> so

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
you have great flanking opportunities so

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.580 
you have great flanking opportunities so
maybe<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.940> risk<00:06:25.180> will<00:06:25.360> be<00:06:25.450> worth<00:06:25.600> again<00:06:26.050> it's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
maybe the risk will be worth again it's

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.860 
maybe the risk will be worth again it's
up<00:06:26.710> to<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:27.070> yo<00:06:27.670> you<00:06:27.880> can<00:06:28.120> be<00:06:28.240> as<00:06:28.330> ambitious<00:06:28.510> as

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
up to you yo you can be as ambitious as

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.170 
up to you yo you can be as ambitious as
you<00:06:29.080> want<00:06:29.290> in<00:06:29.470> this<00:06:29.590> game<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.790> it<00:06:30.910> can<00:06:31.060> either

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
you want in this game and it can either

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:39.750 
you want in this game and it can either
completely<00:06:31.720> backfire<00:06:32.290> or<00:06:32.320> pay<00:06:32.980> off

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.670 

so<00:06:40.300> we<00:06:40.420> can<00:06:40.540> see<00:06:40.690> after<00:06:40.810> we've<00:06:41.050> passed<00:06:41.290> over

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
so we can see after we've passed over

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.530 
so we can see after we've passed over
these<00:06:41.800> undulations<00:06:42.100> in<00:06:42.760> the<00:06:42.850> hills<00:06:43.090> this<00:06:43.480> is

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
these undulations in the hills this is

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.180 
these undulations in the hills this is
the<00:06:43.660> general<00:06:43.990> way<00:06:44.290> that<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.620> North<00:06:44.860> would

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
the general way that the North would

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.220 
the general way that the North would
take<00:06:45.640> to<00:06:45.970> get<00:06:46.120> into<00:06:46.420> the<00:06:46.630> southern<00:06:47.110> side<00:06:47.530> space

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
take to get into the southern side space

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.860 
take to get into the southern side space
we<00:06:50.230> reach<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.650> edge<00:06:50.740> of<00:06:50.890> the<00:06:50.980> map<00:06:51.160> but<00:06:51.750> it's<00:06:52.750> a

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
we reach the edge of the map but it's a

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.200 
we reach the edge of the map but it's a
lot<00:06:53.050> quicker<00:06:53.290> to<00:06:53.560> get<00:06:53.680> into<00:06:53.950> their<00:06:54.160> base<00:06:54.550> along

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
lot quicker to get into their base along

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.150 
lot quicker to get into their base along
here<00:06:55.540> than<00:06:55.690> it<00:06:55.810> is<00:06:55.840> using<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.410> railroads<00:06:56.890> and

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
here than it is using the railroads and

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.780 
here than it is using the railroads and
the<00:06:57.190> trains<00:06:57.850> that<00:06:58.060> you<00:06:58.150> have<00:06:58.300> to<00:06:58.450> dodge

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
the trains that you have to dodge

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.700 
the trains that you have to dodge
there's<00:07:00.790> almost<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:01.180> beeline<00:07:01.660> along<00:07:02.080> here<00:07:02.410> and

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
there's almost a beeline along here and

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.950 
there's almost a beeline along here and
then<00:07:03.400> probably<00:07:03.880> another<00:07:04.120> choke<00:07:04.420> point<00:07:04.720> coming

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
then probably another choke point coming

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.190 
then probably another choke point coming
up<00:07:05.280> as<00:07:06.280> you<00:07:06.490> can<00:07:06.640> see<00:07:06.790> this<00:07:06.910> area<00:07:07.390> on<00:07:07.630> my<00:07:07.900> right

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
up as you can see this area on my right

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.110 
up as you can see this area on my right
past<00:07:08.770> this<00:07:08.950> building<00:07:09.400> is<00:07:09.520> very<00:07:09.820> open<00:07:10.240> and

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
past this building is very open and
