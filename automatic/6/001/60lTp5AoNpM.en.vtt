00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The online sports betting market deals every year in 
 Portugal with about 700 million euro,  

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and 14.5 thousand million euro in Europe. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
With such business volume, one professional gambler can win 
 as much as one football player.  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
His name is Paulo Rebelo and he assumes himself 
 as a Professional Trader of online bets. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This Portuguese 28 years old says he can win 
 as much as the football players. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I developed exhaustive studies about football, about statistical analysis to football. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I know what’s the probability of a certain team score 
 a goal from a corner kick, for example. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We, working from home in a football match,  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
can win as much as a football player who’s playing the game. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In this world of online betting, the football clubs, which are 
 the main organizers of the sports event,  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
they feel deceived by not having a fair return.  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The clubs and the football league who, in some way,  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
have their competitions and their rights abused without the 
 fair return in relation to that use. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
At this point we essentially want this activity to be regulated. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There are some who fears the sport will end prejudiced 
 by this activity, jeopardizing the integrity of competitions. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The executive director of the European professional football league, Emanuel Medeiros,  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
throws a challenge to the online bookmakers and takes the front 
 line in this battle in favor of regulation.  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Either through legislation, or through regulation by sports organisms,  

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we are prepared to take this process to the 
 end and fight this battle.  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And surely I'll be at the forefront of it. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In Portugal, this market moves about 700 million euro each year. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Filipe Safont, Betfair country manager in Portugal, states that 
 he’s in favor of the regulation. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Betfair is completely in favor of the regulation 
 of the online gambling market.  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We believe it is an asset for the economy where we are, for 
 the market where we are also, for the national sport. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
According to the H2 Gambling Capital, Europe had become the 
 great online gambling market in the world. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Answering for about 14.5 thousand million of the total 31.3 
 thousand million euro income of the industry. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If all this activity would be taxed, states could raise millions each year. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The Portuguese state is also concerned, and therefore, the 
 government created an inter-ministry commission  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that will investigate the legal framework for online bookmakers. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
By the end of the year, this committee will have conclusions to present.
