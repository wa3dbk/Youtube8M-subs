start removing the wiring harness for

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.180 
start removing the wiring harness for
the<00:00:49.940> injectors<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.989> spark<00:00:51.260> plugs<00:00:51.440> so

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
the injectors and the spark plugs so

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.790 
the injectors and the spark plugs so
just<00:00:52.400> remove<00:00:53.180> these<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.140> remember<00:00:54.650> where

them up now that you have the injectors
and<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.210> spark<00:00:59.480> plugs<00:00:59.750> unplugged<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:01.370> want

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
and the spark plugs unplugged you want

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.390 
and the spark plugs unplugged you want
to<00:01:01.900> push<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.079> harness<00:01:03.380> down<00:01:03.620> so<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:04.309> have

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
to push the harness down so you have

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.240 
to push the harness down so you have
room<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.970> get<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.300> valve<00:01:05.690> out<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.009> have

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
room to get the valve out so to have

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.430 
room to get the valve out so to have
room<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.670> take<00:01:07.790> out<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.119> valve<00:01:08.330> cover<00:01:08.660> we<00:01:09.320> have

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
room to take out the valve cover we have

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.469 
room to take out the valve cover we have
to<00:01:09.560> remove<00:01:09.890> these<00:01:10.729> two<00:01:10.960> coolant<00:01:11.960> hoses<00:01:12.290> so

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
to remove these two coolant hoses so

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.620 
to remove these two coolant hoses so
drain<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> coolant<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.110> remove<00:01:15.740> those<00:01:15.890> hoses

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
drain the coolant and remove those hoses

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.940 
drain the coolant and remove those hoses
so<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.050> have<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.350> coolant<00:01:18.710> drained

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
so now that you have the coolant drained

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.310 
so now that you have the coolant drained
you<00:01:19.460> want<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.729> remove<00:01:20.090> move<00:01:20.690> these<00:01:20.869> hoses<00:01:21.229> out

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
you want to remove move these hoses out

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440 
you want to remove move these hoses out
of<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.500> way<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.100> be<00:01:22.250> easier<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.759> move<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.240> out

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
of the way so be easier to move this out

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.779 
of the way so be easier to move this out
and<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:24.380> get<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.679> top<00:01:24.979> hose<00:01:25.250> off<00:01:25.429> you<00:01:25.640> can

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
and to get this top hose off you can

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.419 
and to get this top hose off you can
ever<00:01:26.000> have<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.569> remove<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.050> air<00:01:27.140> duct<00:01:27.429> so

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
ever have to remove the air duct so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.040 
ever have to remove the air duct so
before<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:28.970> take<00:01:29.119> off<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.450> valve<00:01:29.630> cover<00:01:29.899> you

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
before you take off the valve cover you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.990 
before you take off the valve cover you
want<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.259> take<00:01:30.380> off<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.560> oil<00:01:30.710> fill<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.460> it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
want to take off the oil fill and it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.820 
want to take off the oil fill and it
will<00:01:32.149> move<00:01:32.600> out<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> way<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.770> you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
will move out of the way so that you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.320 
will move out of the way so that you
don't<00:01:33.979> damage<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.429> out<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.940> way<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.090> want

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
don't damage it out of the way you want

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.600 
don't damage it out of the way you want
to<00:01:35.390> start<00:01:35.600> them<00:01:35.690> bolting<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.380> valve<00:01:36.590> cover<00:01:36.860> by

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
to start them bolting the valve cover by

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.790 
to start them bolting the valve cover by
these<00:01:37.850> bolts<00:01:38.300> there's<00:01:38.959> four<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.590> take

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
these bolts there's four on so to take

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.130 
these bolts there's four on so to take
off<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.250> two<00:01:40.429> back<00:01:41.030> bolts<00:01:41.539> you<00:01:41.869> have<00:01:41.990> to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
off the two back bolts you have to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.370 
off the two back bolts you have to
remove<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:43.209> this<00:01:44.209> hose<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.720> then<00:01:44.990> remove

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
remove that this hose and then remove

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.070 
remove that this hose and then remove
that<00:01:45.590> plastic<00:01:45.979> piece<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:47.959> will

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
that plastic piece and then that will

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.460 
that plastic piece and then that will
give<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.649> access<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.069> that<00:01:49.399> hole<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> it

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
give get you access to that hole so it

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.930 
give get you access to that hole so it
can<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.740> tricky<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.100> take<00:01:52.399> off<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.729> valve

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
can be tricky to take off the valve

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:07.969 
can be tricky to take off the valve
cover<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.509> might<00:01:53.660> have<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.929> wiggle<00:01:54.080> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.109 

so<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.100> remove<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.580> might<00:02:09.700> have<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.000> wait

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
so to remove it you might have to wait

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.570 
so to remove it you might have to wait
overrun<00:02:10.510> with<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> AC<00:02:10.960> line<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:12.070> be<00:02:12.220> careful

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
overrun with the AC line just be careful

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.160 
overrun with the AC line just be careful
not<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> damage<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:13.870> your<00:02:14.020> new

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
not to damage it so with your new

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
not to damage it so with your new
electors<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.890> want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.160> soak<00:02:15.310> them<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.640> engine

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
electors you want to soak them in engine

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.010 
electors you want to soak them in engine
oil<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.990> 12<00:02:17.260> hours

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
oil for 12 hours

oil for 12 hours
so<00:02:20.020> now<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.770> you're<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.130> replacing

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so now that you're going to be replacing

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.300 
so now that you're going to be replacing
the<00:02:21.670> lifters<00:02:22.210> you're<00:02:22.960> going<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.500> make<00:02:24.160> sure

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the lifters you're going to make sure

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.620 
the lifters you're going to make sure
that<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.730> piston<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.300> working<00:02:25.450> with

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that the piston that you're working with

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.960 
that the piston that you're working with
is<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.990> bottom<00:02:26.350> dead<00:02:26.590> center<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.850> can

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
is that bottom dead center so you can

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.640 
is that bottom dead center so you can
take<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> welding<00:02:28.750> rod<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:29.110> something<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.620> just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
take a welding rod or something and just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.730 
take a welding rod or something and just
so<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.850> can<00:02:31.000> feel<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.420> piston<00:02:31.780> through

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
so that you can feel the piston through

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.500 
so that you can feel the piston through
the<00:02:32.980> spark<00:02:33.250> plug<00:02:33.430> hole<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.850> you're<00:02:34.360> also

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the spark plug hole and you're also

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.270 
the spark plug hole and you're also
going<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:34.990> someone<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.590> turn<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
going to get someone to turn the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.330 
going to get someone to turn the
crankshaft<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.840> get<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.650> up<00:02:38.800> bottom<00:02:39.190> dead

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
crankshaft to get it up bottom dead

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220 
crankshaft to get it up bottom dead
center<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.790> when<00:02:40.450> you're<00:02:40.600> installing<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.200> new

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
center so when you're installing the new

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.680 
center so when you're installing the new
rocker<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.100> taking<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> out<00:02:42.820> one<00:02:43.450> make<00:02:43.660> sure

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
rocker and taking it out one make sure

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.200 
rocker and taking it out one make sure
that<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.110> cam<00:02:44.380> lobe<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.670> pressing<00:02:45.910> down

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
that like cam lobe is not pressing down

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.120 
that like cam lobe is not pressing down
on<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.510> rocker<00:02:46.690> otherwise<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.830> won't<00:02:47.950> be

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
on the rocker otherwise you won't be

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.370 
on the rocker otherwise you won't be
able<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> special

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
able to get it in so this is a special

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.200 
able to get it in so this is a special
tool<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.310> will<00:02:51.430> need<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.730> compress<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
tool that you will need to compress the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.600 
tool that you will need to compress the
valves<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.410> able<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.650> remove<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.220> rockers

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
valves to be able to remove the rockers

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.860 
valves to be able to remove the rockers
and<00:02:54.850> then<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.780> lifters<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:58.060> part<00:02:58.360> will

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
and then the lifters so this part will

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.530 
and then the lifters so this part will
go<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> cam<00:02:59.440> shaft<00:02:59.650> this<00:03:00.430> push<00:03:01.180> down<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
go on the cam shaft this push down the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.490 
go on the cam shaft this push down the
valve<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.950> with<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> tool<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.450> valve<00:03:04.660> we

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
valve so with the tool on the valve we

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.210 
valve so with the tool on the valve we
want<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.740> be<00:03:05.800> able<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:07.140> twist<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.590> injectors

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
want to be able to twist the injectors

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.790 
want to be able to twist the injectors
so<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.760> they<00:03:09.940> won't<00:03:10.030> damage<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.560> tool

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
so that they won't damage it the tool

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.430 
so that they won't damage it the tool
slips<00:03:12.070> off<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:13.600> is<00:03:13.750> how<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.930> tool<00:03:14.230> goes

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
slips off so this is how the tool goes

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.040 
slips off so this is how the tool goes
on<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:15.520> part<00:03:15.790> goes<00:03:16.180> around<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.600> cam<00:03:16.780> lobe

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
on this part goes around the cam lobe

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.870 
on this part goes around the cam lobe
and<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.610> part<00:03:19.440> pushes<00:03:20.440> down<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and then this part pushes down on the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.650 
and then this part pushes down on the
valve<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.800> see<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.420> then<00:03:25.420> you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
valve if you can see that and then you

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.050 
valve if you can see that and then you
put<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> ratchet<00:03:26.110> on<00:03:26.410> there<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.920> twist<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.340> I'll

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
put a ratchet on there to twist it I'll

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.670 
put a ratchet on there to twist it I'll
let<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.330> have<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.570> valve<00:03:28.750> depressed<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.500> can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
let you have the valve depressed you can

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
let you have the valve depressed you can
remove<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.190> rocker<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.370> lifter

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
remove the rocker and then the lifter

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.320 
remove the rocker and then the lifter
will<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:34.510> pull<00:03:34.720> right<00:03:34.750> out

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.070 

and<00:03:38.870> there's<00:03:39.320> your<00:03:39.440> lifter<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.960> see

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
and there's your lifter so you can see

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.630 
and there's your lifter so you can see
that<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.410> old<00:03:42.620> lifter<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.460> took

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
that this old lifter that we just took

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.660 
that this old lifter that we just took
out<00:03:43.850> has<00:03:44.510> too<00:03:44.720> much<00:03:44.840> play<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:46.040> new<00:03:46.190> ones<00:03:46.430> in

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
out has too much play the new ones in

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.070 
out has too much play the new ones in
here<00:03:51.280> should<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.310> no<00:03:52.640> play<00:03:52.880> that's<00:03:53.780> what<00:03:53.960> we

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
here should have no play that's what we

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.470 
here should have no play that's what we
want<00:03:54.490> now<00:03:55.490> that<00:03:55.520> we<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.000> new<00:03:56.120> lifters

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
want now that we have the new lifters

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
want now that we have the new lifters
we're<00:03:56.630> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.900> installing<00:03:57.170> them<00:03:57.590> it's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
we're going to be installing them it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280 
we're going to be installing them it's
pretty<00:03:58.520> simple<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.600> opposite<00:03:59.930> way<00:04:00.050> that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
pretty simple just the opposite way that

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.490 
pretty simple just the opposite way that
you<00:04:00.380> took<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.710> mount<00:04:01.270> so<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.690> put<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.110> lifter

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
you took up mount so you put the lifter

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.150 
you took up mount so you put the lifter
in<00:04:03.590> first<00:04:03.860> get<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.850> rocker<00:04:05.090> ready<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.600> put<00:04:05.780> in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
in first get the rocker ready to put in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.190 
in first get the rocker ready to put in
compress<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.310> spring<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.750> rocker<00:04:08.960> will

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
compress the spring and the rocker will

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.520 
compress the spring and the rocker will
just<00:04:09.380> slide<00:04:09.590> in

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.320 

before<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:13.650> put<00:04:13.800> on<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.159> valve<00:04:14.459> cover<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:15.120> want
