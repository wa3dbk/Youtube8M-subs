00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.240 

I'll<00:00:04.880> be<00:00:05.150> showing<00:00:05.300> you<00:00:05.540> two<00:00:05.870> ways<00:00:06.170> of<00:00:06.500> aligning

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
I'll be showing you two ways of aligning

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.270 
I'll be showing you two ways of aligning
your<00:00:07.520> eyes<00:00:07.960> so<00:00:08.960> let's<00:00:09.380> get<00:00:09.710> started<00:00:12.280> since

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
your eyes so let's get started since

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.489 
your eyes so let's get started since
most<00:00:13.580> of<00:00:13.790> your<00:00:13.969> eyeliner<00:00:14.419> is<00:00:14.749> hidden<00:00:15.230> when<00:00:15.410> you

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:15.499 
most of your eyeliner is hidden when you

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.340 
most of your eyeliner is hidden when you
open<00:00:15.830> up<00:00:15.950> your<00:00:16.070> eyes<00:00:16.300> first<00:00:17.300> start<00:00:17.900> out<00:00:18.050> by

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
open up your eyes first start out by

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:33.650 
open up your eyes first start out by
drawing<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:19.130> line<00:00:19.550> as<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.880> guide

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.190 

so<00:00:34.660> when<00:00:34.810> you<00:00:34.900> open<00:00:34.930> up<00:00:35.290> your<00:00:35.350> eyes<00:00:35.590> you'll<00:00:35.950> see

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so when you open up your eyes you'll see

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
so when you open up your eyes you'll see
where<00:00:38.200> you<00:00:38.380> want<00:00:38.590> your<00:00:38.680> eyeliner<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.400> show<00:00:39.610> up

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
where you want your eyeliner to show up

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:58.530 
where you want your eyeliner to show up
and<00:00:41.290> then<00:00:41.770> fill<00:00:42.580> in<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.760> rest<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.510> area

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.630 

so<00:00:59.540> this<00:00:59.720> is<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.900> very<00:01:00.230> thin<00:01:01.270> eyeliner<00:01:03.640> for

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
so this is a very thin eyeliner for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.920 
so this is a very thin eyeliner for
monolids

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.590 

now<00:01:08.930> I'm<00:01:09.260> going<00:01:09.620> to<00:01:09.770> wind<00:01:10.070> out<00:01:10.220> my<00:01:10.370> eyeliner<00:01:10.850> by

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
now I'm going to wind out my eyeliner by

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.780 
now I'm going to wind out my eyeliner by
starting<00:01:12.050> from<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.290> outside<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:13.190> going<00:01:13.520> in

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
starting from the outside and going in

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.620 
starting from the outside and going in
and<00:01:14.440> using<00:01:15.440> slow<00:01:15.710> motions<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:19.510> connecting<00:01:20.510> at

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
and using slow motions and connecting at

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:38.720 
and using slow motions and connecting at
the<00:01:20.720> top

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:48.609 

so<00:01:39.730> this<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.120> simple<00:01:40.830> winged<00:01:41.830> eyeliner

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.170 

to<00:01:49.619> make<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:49.950> eyes<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.549> larger

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to make your eyes look a little larger

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.399 
to make your eyes look a little larger
you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:52.759> apply<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> thicker<00:01:54.329> line<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.960> top<00:01:57.409> if

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you can apply a thicker line on top if

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.370 
you can apply a thicker line on top if
you're<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> beginner<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.430> eye<00:01:59.789> lining<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you're a beginner with eye lining you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.179 
you're a beginner with eye lining you
should<00:02:01.649> start<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.070> by<00:02:02.430> doing<00:02:02.490> small<00:02:03.180> strokes

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
should start out by doing small strokes

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:21.610 
should start out by doing small strokes
so<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.850> eyeliner<00:02:06.240> turns<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.840> even

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.949 

so<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.040> my<00:02:23.220> left<00:02:23.490> eye<00:02:23.670> looks<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.660> lot

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so you can see my left eye looks a lot

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.430 
so you can see my left eye looks a lot
larger<00:02:25.200> than<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.709> right<00:02:25.950> eye<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.200> more

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
larger than my right eye so the more

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.640 
larger than my right eye so the more
eyeliner<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.280> put<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.140> bigger<00:02:31.440> y'all

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
eyeliner you put on the bigger y'all

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:44.059 
eyeliner you put on the bigger y'all
will<00:02:31.920> look<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:41.700> my<00:02:42.030> preference<00:02:42.920> when<00:02:43.920> I

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
will look but for my preference when I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.520 
will look but for my preference when I
put<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> thicker<00:02:44.970> eyeliner<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.660> will<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
put on a thicker eyeliner I will I like

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
it to be seen only slightly above the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:03.140 
it to be seen only slightly above the
crease<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:52.380> too<00:02:52.739> dramatic<00:03:01.940> instead<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.030> doing

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
crease not too dramatic instead of doing

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.759 
crease not too dramatic instead of doing
a<00:03:03.299> winged<00:03:03.680> line<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.660> second<00:03:06.989> way<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:07.470> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
direction of my eye downward and fill it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.000 
direction of my eye downward and fill it
in<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:18.750> gives<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.410> more<00:03:19.650> natural<00:03:20.420> looking

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:41.440 
in this gives it a more natural looking
eye

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.270 

this<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.599> optional<00:03:43.110> but<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.830> line<00:03:44.040> your

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
this is optional but if you line your

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.400 
this is optional but if you line your
bottom<00:03:44.819> lid<00:03:45.140> line<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:47.690> outside<00:03:48.690> corners<00:03:49.140> of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410

bottom lid line the outside corners of
your<00:03:49.620> eye<00:03:51.800> making<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.920> thicker<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.610> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
your eye making it thicker on the

outside<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.540> thinner<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.379> inside<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
outside and thinner on the inside and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.030 
outside and thinner on the inside and
only<00:03:57.000> line<00:03:57.510> halfway<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:59.580> connect<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:01.040> your

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.100 

because<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.680> harsh<00:04:21.919> lines<00:04:22.569> get<00:04:23.569> a<00:04:23.810> black

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
because the harsh lines get a black

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.409 
because the harsh lines get a black
eyeshadow<00:04:24.409> and<00:04:25.930> slightly<00:04:26.930> smudge<00:04:27.830> out<00:04:28.419> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
eyeshadow and slightly smudge out the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:46.590 
eyeshadow and slightly smudge out the
outer<00:04:29.599> corner

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600
