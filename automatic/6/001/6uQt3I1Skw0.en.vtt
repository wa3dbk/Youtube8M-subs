there<00:00:05.700> are<00:00:05.790> many<00:00:05.940> different<00:00:06.420> types<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:07.020> sewing

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
there are many different types of sewing

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.039 
there are many different types of sewing
machines<00:00:07.830> are<00:00:08.429> sewing<00:00:08.880> devices<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.840> will

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
machines are sewing devices if you will

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.589 
machines are sewing devices if you will
from<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> earliest<00:00:13.830> times<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.269> sewing

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
from the earliest times the sewing

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.090 
from the earliest times the sewing
machine<00:00:15.990> tried<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.680> imitate<00:00:17.000> hand<00:00:18.000> sewing<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
machine tried to imitate hand sewing and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.090 
machine tried to imitate hand sewing and
so<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.160> would<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.730> machines<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> did

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
so you would have machines that did

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
so you would have machines that did
different<00:00:23.100> kinds<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> stitches<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.660> way

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
different kinds of stitches so one way

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.640 
different kinds of stitches so one way
to<00:00:25.490> classify<00:00:26.630> sewing<00:00:27.630> machines<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to classify sewing machines is by the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179 
to classify sewing machines is by the
type<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.340> stitch<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.500> that's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
type of stitch that they make and that's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.740 
type of stitch that they make and that's
what<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> focus<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
what we're going to focus on in this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.139 
what we're going to focus on in this
video<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.710> four<00:00:34.950> types<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:36.050> stitch<00:00:37.050> formation

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
video the four types of stitch formation

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
video the four types of stitch formation
include<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.629> chain<00:00:39.960> stitch<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.860> lock<00:00:41.070> stitch

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
include the chain stitch the lock stitch

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
include the chain stitch the lock stitch
the<00:00:41.820> overlock<00:00:42.270> stitch<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.710> embroidery

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the overlock stitch and the embroidery

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.479 
the overlock stitch and the embroidery
stitch<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.600> stitch<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.350> simply<00:00:46.770> formed<00:00:47.250> by

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
stitch the stitch is simply formed by

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.000 
stitch the stitch is simply formed by
penetrating<00:00:48.420> through<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> fabric<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
penetrating through the fabric with the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.049 
penetrating through the fabric with the
needle<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.780> then<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> looping<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
needle and then just kind of looping the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.160 
needle and then just kind of looping the
loop<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> next<00:00:56.610> stitch<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
loop to the next stitch so that the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
loop to the next stitch so that the
needle<00:00:58.500> comes<00:00:58.770> down<00:00:59.370> picks<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
needle comes down picks it up and you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
needle comes down picks it up and you
form<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> chain<00:01:02.100> here's<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> typical<00:01:03.170> chain

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
form a chain here's a typical chain

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.399 
of a fabric to create an overlap stitch
like<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:15.359> see<00:03:15.389> a<00:03:15.629> multitude<00:03:16.049> of

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
like you see here you see a multitude of

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.940 
like you see here you see a multitude of
different<00:03:16.650> combinations<00:03:18.680> depending<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.799> how

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
different combinations depending on how

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
different combinations depending on how
many<00:03:20.010> threads<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.120> design<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
many threads and the design of the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.099 
many threads and the design of the
stitch<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.680> may<00:03:23.579> have<00:03:23.879> two<00:03:24.329> threads<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
stitch you may have two threads all the

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.729 
stitch you may have two threads all the
way<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.709> eight<00:03:25.920> threads<00:03:26.430> or<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.629> in<00:03:28.260> an

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
way up to eight threads or more in an

way up to eight threads or more in an
overlock<00:03:29.370> stitch<00:03:30.030> basically<00:03:31.099> just<00:03:32.099> remember

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
overlock stitch basically just remember

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
overlock stitch basically just remember
that<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.299> overlock<00:03:34.049> goes<00:03:35.040> over<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.639> edge<00:03:35.879> as

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
that the overlock goes over the edge as

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.309 
that the overlock goes over the edge as
you<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.980> here<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.760> seem<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.569> thread<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
you see here you seem the thread the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.580 
you see here you seem the thread the
edge<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> fabric<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.840> cover<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.410> edges

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
edge of the fabric you cover the edges

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.640 
edge of the fabric you cover the edges
and<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:44.190> trim<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.849> fabric<00:03:45.090> all<00:03:45.599> in<00:03:46.319> one

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
and you trim the fabric all in one

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.729 
and you trim the fabric all in one
passed<00:03:47.190> finally<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.449> machines<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.440> do

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
passed finally you have machines that do

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.439 
of such designs
the<00:04:29.800> fundamental<00:04:30.370> thing<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.759> remember<00:04:31.090> is

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
the fundamental thing to remember is

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.379 
the fundamental thing to remember is
that<00:04:31.479> embroidery<00:04:32.289> machines<00:04:33.389> use

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
that embroidery machines use

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.020 
that embroidery machines use
computerized<00:04:35.050> patterns<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.310> control<00:04:36.849> the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
computerized patterns to control the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.879 
computerized patterns to control the

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
positioning of this fabric when it's

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.360 
positioning of this fabric when it's
being<00:04:42.189> moved<00:04:43.169> back<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.469> forth<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:45.129> different

being moved back and forth in different

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.300 
being moved back and forth in different
directions<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.449> create<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.499> motifs<00:04:47.949> and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310
