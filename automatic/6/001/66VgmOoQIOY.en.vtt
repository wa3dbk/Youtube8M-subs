the<00:01:17.469> pipe<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:18.310> they're<00:01:18.429> using<00:01:18.700> right<00:01:18.850> now<00:01:18.880> is

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
the pipe that they're using right now is

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.080 
the pipe that they're using right now is
one<00:01:20.049> they<00:01:20.200> just<00:01:20.380> like<00:01:20.789> temporarily<00:01:21.789> using

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
one they just like temporarily using

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.690 
one they just like temporarily using
it's<00:01:22.359> actually<00:01:22.600> for<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.780> 600cc<00:01:23.439> bike<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.609> they

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
it's actually for a 600cc bike and they

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.039 
it's actually for a 600cc bike and they
just<00:01:24.850> slop<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.819> actuality<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.929> a

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
just slop it on so in actuality it's a

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.770 
just slop it on so in actuality it's a
lot<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:30.490> lost<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.880> lot<00:01:31.000> of<00:01:31.030> power<00:01:31.469> because<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
lot they lost a lot of power because the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.490 
lot they lost a lot of power because the
pipes<00:01:35.020> made<00:01:35.349> for<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.619> much<00:01:35.649> bigger<00:01:36.429> engine

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
pipes made for a much bigger engine

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.139 
pipes made for a much bigger engine
higher<00:01:38.500> output<00:01:38.770> engine<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:39.579> right<00:01:39.789> now<00:01:39.819> if

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
higher output engine so right now if

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.100 
higher output engine so right now if
they<00:01:40.270> actually<00:01:40.390> made<00:01:40.629> it<00:01:40.750> by<00:01:40.810> quite<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.049> bit

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
they actually made it by quite a bit

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.169 
they actually made it by quite a bit
slower<00:01:41.439> but<00:01:41.709> they<00:01:42.219> said<00:01:42.549> they<00:01:42.579> put<00:01:42.849> it<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.000> for

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
slower but they said they put it on for

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.020 
slower but they said they put it on for
looks<00:01:43.450> as<00:01:43.750> well<00:01:43.959> as<00:01:44.140> sound<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.729> got<00:01:45.849> a<00:01:45.879> nice

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
looks as well as sound it's got a nice

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.149 
looks as well as sound it's got a nice
sound<00:01:46.299> trip<00:01:46.450> right<00:01:46.599> now<00:01:46.629> it<00:01:46.869> actually

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.630 

not<00:01:51.729> as<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:52.210> quite<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.659> good<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:52.929> my<00:01:53.079> ninja<00:01:54.069> 650

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
not as not quite as good as my ninja 650

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.440 
not as not quite as good as my ninja 650
but<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.939> is<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.630> comparable<00:01:56.140> i<00:01:56.259> said<00:01:56.530> no<00:01:57.399> i

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
but it is a comparable i said no i

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.570 
but it is a comparable i said no i
dominated<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.630> would<00:01:58.749> be<00:01:58.869> much<00:01:59.049> louder

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.460

it's<00:02:11.470> kind<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.650> interesting<00:02:11.860> even<00:02:12.340> though

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it's kind of interesting even though

because<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.830> really<00:02:29.920> hot<00:02:30.160> today<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.780> you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
because it's really hot today but you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.330 
because it's really hot today but you
think<00:02:32.020> with<00:02:32.200> such<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> small<00:02:32.650> engine<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
think with such a small engine that it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
think with such a small engine that it
wouldn't<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:33.940> affected<00:02:34.480> by<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.660> heat<00:02:34.959> you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
wouldn't be as affected by the heat you

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.110 
wouldn't be as affected by the heat you
know<00:02:35.260> which<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:36.400> another<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.000> the
