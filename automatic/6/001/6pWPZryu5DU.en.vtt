00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.919
 but still the clear better team and put on 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 klaas-jan Huntelaar 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.079
 a bit happy, the ball comes to him 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.699
 but then he does that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.929
 with all the serenity 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.950
 and so threatens the last suburban train is now also being in the Primera Division 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.380
 at Real Madrid 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.409
 seven hits 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.050
 in six games 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 Srecko Katanec CeBIT is reasonably serving the coach of Macedonia because 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 his team do absolutely nothing 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.650
 instead Wesley Sneijder misses 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.340
 wonderfully played on the buyer GoÃŸmann Dr 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.230
 he looks at it exactly 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 on it exactly 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.820
 even before the break 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 the dress to zero 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 a double strike 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880
 until the break a strong performance 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 in the sold out Amsterdam 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.820
 after the break in a scramble for a euro 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.410
 but the big one 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.170
 how is it now? 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 and the last pressure is no longer noticeable because they are in the lead 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.690
 instead Macedonia once the IAB is the best opportunity in the whole 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 game 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.929
 just before the end 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.490
 Giovanni van Bronckhorst the captain once again scored points 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 absolutely 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 Rafael driving Ford came in the second half 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 for the guests it is important 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.800
 and also against Scotland 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.840
 almost 1100 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.869
 five wins in five games are very convincing 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.709
 Bert van Marwijk and the Netherlands fifth place for the wm-tickets
