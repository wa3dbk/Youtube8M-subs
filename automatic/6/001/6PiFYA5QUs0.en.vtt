00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hello everyone and today I'm going to be

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.889 
hello everyone and today I'm going to be
doing<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.959> video<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.859> applying<00:00:05.609> two<00:00:06.089> materials

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
doing a video on applying two materials

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.950 
doing a video on applying two materials
to<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> object<00:00:08.420> well<00:00:09.420> two<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.290> more<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.960> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to a object well two or more and this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.650 
to a object well two or more and this
also<00:00:13.170> works<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.530> textures<00:00:13.980> because<00:00:14.660> textures

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
also works for textures because textures

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.740 
also works for textures because textures
link<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> our<00:00:16.139> material<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> object<00:00:17.750> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
link to our material not the object so

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.279 
link to our material not the object so
um<00:00:18.930> yeah<00:00:19.619> I'll<00:00:19.980> show<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.310> quickly<00:00:21.050> go<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
that materials tab you have to add a new

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.540 
that materials tab you have to add a new
material

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
material

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.910 
material
click<00:00:26.550> these<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.740> don't

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
don't so um let's just go for a red a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
don't so um let's just go for a red a
red<00:00:44.430> texture<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.660> blue<00:00:46.050> texture

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.530 

the<00:00:50.070> first<00:00:50.340> texture<00:00:50.880> will<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.300> main

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
the first texture will be the main

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.270 
the first texture will be the main
texture<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.340> then<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.820> secondary<00:00:54.600> texture

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
texture and then the secondary texture

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
texture and then the secondary texture
will<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.180> secondary<00:00:57.600> texture<00:00:58.080> the<00:00:58.260> one

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
will be the secondary texture the one

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
will be the secondary texture the one
that<00:00:58.590> only<00:00:59.190> becomes<00:00:59.670> what<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.240> it<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.450> be

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that only becomes what you want it to be

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.540 
that only becomes what you want it to be
so<00:01:02.430> tap<00:01:03.090> into<00:01:03.330> edit<00:01:03.570> mode<00:01:03.830> go<00:01:04.830> into<00:01:05.130> face

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
so tap into edit mode go into face

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.490 
so tap into edit mode go into face
select<00:01:05.820> mode<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.350> face

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
select mode you don't have to do face

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.640 
select mode you don't have to do face
like<00:01:07.770> mode<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.310> drinks<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.730> easier

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
like mode I'm just drinks it's easier

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.850 
like mode I'm just drinks it's easier
and<00:01:10.650> when<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.220> desired<00:01:11.670> face<00:01:12.860> go

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and when you have your desired face go

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.810 
and when you have your desired face go
to<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.100> material<00:01:14.340> over<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.910> and<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.600> sign

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
to your material over here and go sign

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.570 
to your material over here and go sign
so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:20.900> same<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> shift<00:01:23.460> click

so I go same but way you can shift click

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.490 
so I go same but way you can shift click
and<00:01:23.760> add<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.660> once<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:27.500> just

material<00:02:42.500> go<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.310> textures<00:02:43.700> tab<00:02:43.879> for<00:02:44.120> that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
material go to the textures tab for that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.979 
material go to the textures tab for that
let's<00:02:45.620> add<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.129> a<00:02:46.989> magic<00:02:48.670> that's<00:02:49.670> both<00:02:50.329> again

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:00.350 

let's<00:02:53.989> change<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.470> color<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:55.190> green

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.390 

I'm<00:03:00.990> very<00:03:01.290> dull<00:03:01.680> green

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.900 

and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.690 
and
but<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:08.080> know<00:03:08.230> why<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.710> missing<00:03:09.250> some

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
but don't know why it's missing some

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.150 
but don't know why it's missing some
bits<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.240> they're<00:03:10.450> white<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:10.990> um<00:03:11.860> let's<00:03:12.100> just

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
bits and they're white but um let's just

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.630 
bits and they're white but um let's just
try<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.610> out<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:14.010> they<00:03:15.010> see<00:03:15.070> you've<00:03:15.460> got<00:03:15.550> this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
try it out up they see you've got this

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.590 
try it out up they see you've got this
cool<00:03:16.060> reddish<00:03:16.990> texture<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.300> then<00:03:19.300> you've<00:03:19.450> got

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
cool reddish texture and then you've got

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.070 
cool reddish texture and then you've got
this<00:03:19.980> weird<00:03:21.030> what<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.150> supposed<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.840> blue

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
this weird what was supposed to be blue

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.950 
this weird what was supposed to be blue
texture<00:03:24.030> again<00:03:25.030> there<00:03:25.210> is<00:03:25.300> blue<00:03:25.540> there

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
texture again there is blue there

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.810 
texture again there is blue there
this<00:03:26.170> must<00:03:26.710> be<00:03:26.800> white<00:03:27.070> streaks<00:03:27.460> through<00:03:27.700> it

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
this must be white streaks through it

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:36.570 
this must be white streaks through it
but<00:03:28.420> um<00:03:28.600> yeah<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:33.540> realistic<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> faces<00:03:35.580> but

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
but um yeah and realistic to faces but

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.020 
but um yeah and realistic to faces but
you<00:03:36.910> can<00:03:37.060> do<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.300> on<00:03:37.540> any<00:03:37.840> object<00:03:38.790> chef<00:03:39.790> just

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you can do this on any object chef just

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.620 
you can do this on any object chef just
select<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.630> face<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.260> want<00:03:42.150> or<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.420> four

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
select the face you want or the four

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.720 
select the face you want or the four
vertices<00:03:43.840> or<00:03:44.320> three<00:03:44.560> vertices<00:03:44.830> intersect<00:03:45.550> at

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
vertices or three vertices intersect at

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.110 
vertices or three vertices intersect at
the<00:03:45.820> face<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.150> want<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.800> then<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:48.790> curve

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
the face you want and then this curve

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.970 
the face you want and then this curve
assign

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.740 

so<00:03:53.980> yeah<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.939> was<00:03:55.120> my<00:03:55.269> quick<00:03:55.689> tutorial<00:03:56.260> on

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
so yeah it was my quick tutorial on

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.670 
so yeah it was my quick tutorial on
applying<00:03:58.750> multiple<00:03:59.049> materials<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:01.680> lot

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
applying multiple materials to a lot

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.860 
applying multiple materials to a lot
more<00:04:02.950> multiple<00:04:03.579> materials<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.299> textures<00:04:04.569> to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
more multiple materials and textures to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.309 
more multiple materials and textures to
a<00:04:04.900> object<00:04:06.000> actually<00:04:07.000> before<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.299> finish<00:04:07.750> I'm

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
a object actually before I finish I'm

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.220 
a object actually before I finish I'm
just<00:04:08.590> gonna<00:04:08.709> show<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:08.920> another<00:04:09.099> way<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:10.230> it's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
just gonna show you another way so it's

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
just gonna show you another way so it's
got<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.439> camera<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.590> say<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.189> didn't<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.730> how<00:04:15.939> to

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
got a camera so say I didn't know how to

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.180 
got a camera so say I didn't know how to
do<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.519> another<00:04:18.519> way<00:04:18.669> is<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.329> pay

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
do that and another way is to go pay

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.290 
do that and another way is to go pay
separate<00:04:21.190> by<00:04:21.340> selection<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.930> now<00:04:23.910> they're<00:04:24.910> two

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
separate by selection so now they're two

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.610 
separate by selection so now they're two
different<00:04:26.820> objects

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.840 

so<00:04:31.130> let<00:04:31.280> me<00:04:31.310> start<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> new<00:04:31.700> file<00:04:32.090> first<00:04:32.500> okay<00:04:33.850> so

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
so let me start a new file first okay so

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.879 
so let me start a new file first okay so
who<00:04:35.030> tap<00:04:35.330> into<00:04:35.690> edit<00:04:36.500> mode<00:04:37.630> P<00:04:38.630> separate<00:04:40.690> so

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
who tap into edit mode P separate so

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.970 
who tap into edit mode P separate so
that's<00:04:42.889> different

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.060 

that's<00:04:46.460> different

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
that's different

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.090 
that's different
so<00:04:48.670> let's<00:04:49.390> edit<00:04:49.660> material<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.010> look

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
so let's edit material you have to look

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.680 
so let's edit material you have to look
at<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.870> quick<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:53.200> -<00:04:54.720> who<00:04:55.720> cares<00:04:55.990> just

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
at to the quick there - who cares just

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.790 
at to the quick there - who cares just
just<00:04:58.690> another<00:04:58.930> way<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.080> do<00:04:59.290> it<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.560> it's

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
just another way to do it and it's

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.360 
just another way to do it and it's
render<00:05:00.040> an<00:05:00.130> image<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.700> there<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:02.010> also<00:05:03.010> you

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
render an image and there you also you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.100 
render an image and there you also you
can<00:05:03.640> join<00:05:03.940> these<00:05:04.150> back<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.570> which<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.870> believe

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
can join these back in which I believe

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.090 
can join these back in which I believe
is<00:05:05.290> control<00:05:05.650> J<00:05:05.920> yet<00:05:06.700> control<00:05:07.120> J<00:05:07.360> or<00:05:08.100> object

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
is control J yet control J or object

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.410 
is control J yet control J or object
joint<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:10.020> now<00:05:11.160> it's<00:05:12.160> one<00:05:12.340> again

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
joint and now it's one again

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.690 
joint and now it's one again
but<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.230> ends<00:05:15.500> up<00:05:15.590> having<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:16.010> two<00:05:16.220> materials

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
but it ends up having the two materials

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.170 
but it ends up having the two materials
anyway<00:05:17.230> so<00:05:18.230> I'm<00:05:18.380> just<00:05:18.680> going<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:19.070> sign<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:19.790> the

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
anyway so I'm just going a sign is the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.590 
anyway so I'm just going a sign is the
easier<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.870> two<00:05:21.820> or<00:05:22.820> for<00:05:23.090> me<00:05:23.150> it's<00:05:23.330> easier

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
easier of the two or for me it's easier

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.090 
easier of the two or for me it's easier
but<00:05:23.960> um<00:05:25.090> yeah<00:05:26.090> thanks<00:05:26.540> for<00:05:26.720> watching<00:05:27.140> I<00:05:27.890> hope

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
but um yeah thanks for watching I hope

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.720 
but um yeah thanks for watching I hope

just come in also I'm looking for a site
where<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:35.930> can<00:05:36.350> put<00:05:36.710> my<00:05:37.960> blend<00:05:38.960> files<00:05:39.260> up<00:05:39.560> so

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
where I can put my blend files up so

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.640 
where I can put my blend files up so
that<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.370> can<00:05:41.270> just<00:05:41.300> put<00:05:41.630> a<00:05:41.660> link<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.320> and
