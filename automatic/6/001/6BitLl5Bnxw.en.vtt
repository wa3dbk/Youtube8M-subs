into third gear we'll be doing about 40
miles<00:01:16.670> an<00:01:16.820> hour<00:01:16.940> so<00:01:17.259> we're<00:01:18.259> coming<00:01:18.470> into<00:01:18.590> a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680

miles an hour so we're coming into a
corner<00:01:19.040> now<00:01:19.220> I'm<00:01:19.850> traveling<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.450> bit<00:01:20.570> too<00:01:20.720> fast

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990

we've<00:01:25.100> gone<00:01:25.280> off<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.750> left<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.170> road<00:01:27.350> so

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
we've gone off and we left the road so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.070 
we've gone off and we left the road so
that<00:01:28.520> was<00:01:28.640> obviously<00:01:28.970> on<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.360> skid<00:01:29.990> control

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
that was obviously on a skid control

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.740 
that was obviously on a skid control
area<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.130> was<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:31.580> was<00:01:31.700> pretty<00:01:31.880> safe<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.570> on

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
area so it was it was pretty safe but on

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.999 
area so it was it was pretty safe but on
the<00:01:33.080> road<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.619> could<00:01:33.770> have<00:01:33.890> been<00:01:33.950> a

the road that could have been a
potentially<00:01:34.759> lethal<00:01:34.910> situation

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780

spectacular you might have seen rally
cars<00:01:43.700> going<00:01:44.030> into<00:01:44.210> corners<00:01:44.600> like<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.810> going

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
cars going into corners like that going

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.590 
cars going into corners like that going
in<00:01:45.350> sideways<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.009> give<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.820> little

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
in sideways but give you a little

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.180 
in sideways but give you a little
example<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.500> go<00:01:48.679> in<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> corner

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
example of that and go in the corner

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.430 
example of that and go in the corner
when<00:01:49.490> I'm<00:01:49.580> making<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:49.940> rear<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.300> other<00:01:51.229> ones

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
when I'm making the rear the other ones

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.649 
when I'm making the rear the other ones
actually<00:01:51.619> happen<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.509> we've

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
actually happen there is that we've

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.260 
actually happen there is that we've
completely<00:01:54.110> spun<00:01:54.470> around<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.399> that's<00:01:56.000> two

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
completely spun around so that's two

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.539 
completely spun around so that's two
very<00:01:56.689> different<00:01:56.960> skids<00:01:57.439> that<00:01:57.829> need<00:01:58.009> very

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
very different skids that need very

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.219 
very different skids that need very
different<00:01:58.640> amounts<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.450> control<00:02:00.020> and

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
different amounts of control and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.289 
different amounts of control and
different<00:02:00.860> inputs<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.700> actually<00:02:02.000> make<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
different inputs to actually make the

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.910 
different inputs to actually make the
car<00:02:02.450> stay<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.049> road<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.619> that's<00:02:03.740> what

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
car stay on the road and that's what

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.110 
car stay on the road and that's what
we're<00:02:04.040> going<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.220> look<00:02:04.369> at<00:02:04.490> next<00:02:09.790> first<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.940> all

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
we're going to look at next first of all

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.180 
we're going to look at next first of all
it's<00:02:11.540> important<00:02:12.049> to<00:02:12.170> understand<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.860> your

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's important to understand that your

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.039 
it's important to understand that your
tires<00:02:13.430> really<00:02:14.060> decide<00:02:14.510> whether<00:02:14.750> you'll<00:02:14.900> get

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
tires really decide whether you'll get

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.259 
tires really decide whether you'll get
around<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.350> corner<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.799> not<00:02:16.010> your<00:02:16.489> tires<00:02:16.760> like

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
around the corner or not your tires like

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.819 
around the corner or not your tires like
to<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.480> more<00:02:17.660> weight<00:02:17.900> pressed<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.440> them<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
to have more weight pressed on them the

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.960 
to have more weight pressed on them the
more<00:02:19.010> weight<00:02:19.190> you'll<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.549> pressed<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.940> a

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
more weight you'll have pressed on a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.479 
more weight you'll have pressed on a
tire<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:20.959> grip<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.380> tire<00:02:21.650> has<00:02:21.920> it's

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
tire the more grip that tire has it's

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.130 
tire the more grip that tire has it's
just<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> friction<00:02:23.209> exercise<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:23.989> my

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
just like a friction exercise like my

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.840 
just like a friction exercise like my
two<00:02:24.200> hands<00:02:24.620> pressing<00:02:24.980> together<00:02:25.100> really

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
two hands pressing together really

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.340 
two hands pressing together really
getting<00:02:26.090> weight<00:02:26.299> down<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.750> tire<00:02:26.959> can<00:02:27.200> make

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
getting weight down on the tire can make

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.970 
getting weight down on the tire can make
a<00:02:27.380> difference

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
a difference

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.729 
a difference
so<00:02:28.459> when<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> Kazon<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.269> slide<00:02:29.570> first<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.620> all

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
so when the Kazon is slide first of all

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.020 
so when the Kazon is slide first of all
we<00:02:30.890> need<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.100> understand<00:02:31.489> which<00:02:31.640> end<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.940> this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
we need to understand which end of this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.840 
we need to understand which end of this
class<00:02:32.299> sliding<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.019> then<00:02:33.530> add<00:02:33.799> weight<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
class sliding and then add weight to the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.120 
class sliding and then add weight to the
rear<00:02:35.150> by<00:02:35.540> accelerating<00:02:36.109> or<00:02:36.440> weight<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
rear by accelerating or weight to the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.310 
rear by accelerating or weight to the
front<00:02:37.400> by<00:02:37.880> slowing<00:02:38.150> down

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.840 

okay<00:02:48.320> let's<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.650> look<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:49.010> controlling<00:02:49.700> a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
okay let's have a look at controlling a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
okay let's have a look at controlling a
front-end<00:02:50.300> skid<00:02:50.600> now<00:02:50.780> Oh<00:02:50.990> an<00:02:51.260> understeer<00:02:51.800> skid

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
front-end skid now Oh an understeer skid

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160 
front-end skid now Oh an understeer skid
let's<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.850> how<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.420> react<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.960> car

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
let's see how we can react to the car

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.440 
let's see how we can react to the car
correctly<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.830> stay<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.400> control<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.060> not

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
correctly and stay in control and not

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.660 
correctly and stay in control and not
leave<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.870> road<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.830> I'm<00:02:58.070> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.250> drive<00:02:58.520> on

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
leave the road so I'm going to drive on

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.090 
leave the road so I'm going to drive on
to<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.880> skid<00:02:59.150> control<00:02:59.270> area<00:02:59.840> about<00:03:00.470> 40<00:03:00.740> miles

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
to the skid control area about 40 miles

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.070 
to the skid control area about 40 miles
an<00:03:01.280> hour<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.880> get<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> front<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.840> car<00:03:03.050> to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
an hour and get the front of the car to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.200 
an hour and get the front of the car to
slide<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.800> get<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.160> car<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.490> understeer<00:03:05.030> and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
slide and get the car to understeer and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.640 
slide and get the car to understeer and
then<00:03:05.720> I'm<00:03:05.780> going<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:05.990> explain<00:03:06.290> how<00:03:06.350> I'm

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
then I'm going to explain how I'm

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.770 
then I'm going to explain how I'm
controlling<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.940> I'm<00:03:08.030> coming<00:03:08.300> onto<00:03:08.660> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
controlling it so I'm coming onto the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.320 
controlling it so I'm coming onto the
skid<00:03:09.110> control<00:03:09.530> area<00:03:09.890> now<00:03:10.100> I've<00:03:10.730> turned<00:03:11.120> into

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
skid control area now I've turned into

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.240 
skid control area now I've turned into
the<00:03:11.510> corner<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.930> front<00:03:12.230> start<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.770> slide<00:03:13.040> but

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
the corner the front start to slide but

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
the corner the front start to slide but
I'm<00:03:13.370> easing<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.060> throttle<00:03:14.240> I'm<00:03:14.720> loading

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
I'm easing off the throttle I'm loading

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.080 
I'm easing off the throttle I'm loading
up<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> front<00:03:15.590> end<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.100> then<00:03:16.370> front<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
up the front end and then front of the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.390 
up the front end and then front of the
car<00:03:17.330> has<00:03:17.720> now<00:03:17.990> recovered<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.160> see

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
car has now recovered and you can see

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.520 
car has now recovered and you can see
didn't<00:03:20.150> take<00:03:20.330> too<00:03:20.540> much<00:03:20.660> reaction<00:03:21.170> from<00:03:21.290> me

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
didn't take too much reaction from me

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.800 
didn't take too much reaction from me
just<00:03:21.950> easing<00:03:22.400> off<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.700> throttle<00:03:22.880> keeping<00:03:23.720> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
just easing off the throttle keeping the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.420 
just easing off the throttle keeping the
steering<00:03:24.320> pointing<00:03:24.740> in<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.950> direction<00:03:24.980> I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
steering pointing in the direction I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.790 
steering pointing in the direction I
wanted<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.880> go<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.510> carry<00:03:26.810> covered<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.470> we

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
wanted to go the carry covered and we

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.360 
wanted to go the carry covered and we
went<00:03:27.980> around<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.310> corner<00:03:28.460> okay<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:30.590> time<00:03:30.620> as

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
went around the corner okay this time as

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.850 
went around the corner okay this time as
when<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.270> skid<00:03:32.570> control<00:03:32.690> area<00:03:33.260> I'm<00:03:33.680> going

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
when to the skid control area I'm going

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.230 
when to the skid control area I'm going
to<00:03:33.950> be<00:03:34.010> doing<00:03:34.160> around<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.550> same<00:03:34.760> speed<00:03:35.090> around

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
to be doing around the same speed around

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.110 
to be doing around the same speed around
40<00:03:35.780> miles<00:03:35.960> an<00:03:36.200> hour<00:03:36.350> but<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.130> car<00:03:37.490> is<00:03:37.820> going<00:03:38.030> to

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
40 miles an hour but the car is going to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.270 
40 miles an hour but the car is going to
slide<00:03:38.450> at<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.690> rear<00:03:39.050> so<00:03:39.710> let's<00:03:40.010> have<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.160> little

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
slide at the rear so let's have a little

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.130 
slide at the rear so let's have a little
look<00:03:40.520> at<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.360> we're<00:03:41.660> entering<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
look at that so we're entering the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.130 
look at that so we're entering the
corner<00:03:42.380> now<00:03:42.680> I've<00:03:43.400> turned<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.810> rear<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
corner now I've turned in the rear of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.050 
corner now I've turned in the rear of
the<00:03:45.350> car<00:03:45.560> start<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.070> slide<00:03:46.340> I'm<00:03:46.580> compensating

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the car start to slide I'm compensating

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.120 
the car start to slide I'm compensating
with<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.570> steering<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.200> easing<00:03:48.770> on<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.920> little

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
with the steering and easing on a little

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.760 
with the steering and easing on a little
bit<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.400> throttle<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.000> now<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:51.170> car<00:03:51.410> stayed

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
bit of throttle and now the car stayed

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.280 
bit of throttle and now the car stayed
in<00:03:51.920> control<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.520> stayed<00:03:53.090> on<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.390> road<00:03:53.540> as<00:03:53.840> you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
in control and stayed on the road as you

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.680 
in control and stayed on the road as you
can<00:03:54.410> see<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.980> by<00:03:55.100> coordinating<00:03:55.760> your<00:03:56.120> hands

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
can see just by coordinating your hands
