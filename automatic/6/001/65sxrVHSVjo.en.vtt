00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.380
 well after knowing the main 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.510
 components of a heating system 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.369
 water with solar energy 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 Let's talk about your 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.340
 operation before but we need to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.009
 talk about a physical greatness that is the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 specific mass since the operation of the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.960
 majority of systems and growth 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.540
 depends on it we can define mass 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 as the relationship between the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 mass of a substance and the volume 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.160
 occupied by this substance for example 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.130
 if 10 kg of a given 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.310
 substances occupy the volume of 8 liters 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.970
 the specific mass of the substance shall be 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:59.310
 of 1.25 kilos per liter which is equivalent 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.320
 1.25 grams per cubic centimeter 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.720
 specific mass is a quantity that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.850
 undergoes minor changes in 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.869
 function of the temperature variation of the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 substance 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.630
 water for example has a mass 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.310
 almost equal to 1 when 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 its temperature was 15 degrees 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 Celsius 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 but as its temperature 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.940
 increases 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.950
 verifies whether a small reduction in the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 of its specific mass according to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 illustrated in this graphic 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 this fact leads us to the conclusion that the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.690
 water when there are higher temperatures 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.159
 becomes lighter in 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.229
 simpler heating 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.330
 the thermal reservoir is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.299
 installed on a level above the collector 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 solar heating during the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 water temperature inside the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.720
 of the solar collector pipes will be 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.159
 greater than the temperature inside the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
 thermal reservoir 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.070
 so for a short time 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.320
 the water that is most heated has 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 the lowest specific mass when 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040
 compared to the water in the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.530
 reservoir 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.350
 this will cause the water in the reservoir 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.600
 having to go down promoting the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.120
 warmer water rising that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.770
 in the solar collector inside the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.440
 thermal reservoir 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.600
 this process is repeated until the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.390
 water temperature is practically the same as 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.240
 the same in all points of the system 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.160
 this process of natural circulation of the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.780
 water generated by the difference 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.330
 temperature is called thermo siphon the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.220
 existence of a minimum difference between the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.400
 bottom of the thermal reservoir 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.920
 and the top of the collector is made 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.350
 necessary to avoid recirculation of the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.380
 water from the tank to the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.959
 collectors as shown in that 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.160
 scheme, this difference should be 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.800
 at least 30 centimeters in front of 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 has been presented so far regarding the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.489
 operation of this system 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.610
 you may be having the following 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.830
 doubt whether it is the difference of 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.900
 specific gravity of the water inside the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.239
 solar collector and inside the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.680
 thermal reservoir that provides the 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.110
 your circulation 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.450
 what is the maximum difference 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.549
 exist between these two components of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.920
 system 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.959
 in fact from the theoretical point of view 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.080
 there is a maximum value for this 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.019
 what happens in fact is that 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.989
 the smaller the flow 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.570
 circulating water in other words 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.390
 the water will take longer to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.370
 circular and this may reduce the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.519
 thermal efficiency of the system 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.310
 so what is sought in practice 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.959
 is the installation of the lower reservoir 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.269
 possible difference in the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.340
 collectors, preferably not 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.950
 exceeding five meters 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.170
 moreover, one must not forget 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.380
 respect the minimum threshold 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.930
 required of 30 centimeters to avoid 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.090
 recirculation of the hot water present in the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.820
 reservoir for collectors 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.700
 so the water will circulate in the shortest time 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.450
 possible and the system performance will be 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.450
 satisfactory
