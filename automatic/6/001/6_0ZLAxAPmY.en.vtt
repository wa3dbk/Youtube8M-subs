project how do you want this thing to be
molded<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.590> change<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.149> not

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
molded and change and that is not

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
molded and change and that is not
changing<00:00:34.230> because<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:34.800> part

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

of<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> community<00:00:36.120> scale<00:00:36.480> project

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of it this the community scale project

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.470 
of it this the community scale project
it's<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.620> scale<00:00:37.920> test<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.700> developers<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's a scale test and developers need a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.650 
it's a scale test and developers need a
ton<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> feedback<00:00:40.410> before<00:00:41.059> they<00:00:42.059> move<00:00:42.329> further

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
ton of feedback before they move further

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
ton of feedback before they move further
so<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> quick<00:00:43.590> look<00:00:44.010> at

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so we're going to take a quick look at

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
so we're going to take a quick look at
the<00:00:44.579> overall<00:00:45.180> layout<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> map<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the overall layout of the map with the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
the overall layout of the map with the
terrain<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:48.000> course<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
terrain and of course some of the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
terrain and of course some of the
features<00:00:48.989> around<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> flags<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.460> that's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
features around the flags because that's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.049 
features around the flags because that's
the<00:00:51.149> focus<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.719> map<00:00:52.379> size<00:00:53.059> distances

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the focus here map size distances

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
the focus here map size distances
between<00:00:54.329> flags<00:00:54.930> rough<00:00:55.920> layout<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
between flags rough layout with the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
focus what's actually on the flags focus

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
focus what's actually on the flags focus
on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> rocks<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:03.470> winding

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
on the rocks and the little winding

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
on the rocks and the little winding
creek<00:01:04.739> beds<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> course<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> topography

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
creek beds and of course the topography

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.450 
creek beds and of course the topography
of<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.799> what's<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.310> on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of this because that is what's going on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.830 
of this because that is what's going on
and<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> couple<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.210> wookies<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.689> here

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and we got a couple of wookies in here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
and we got a couple of wookies in here
for<00:01:10.080> scale<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.830> let<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.549> quickly

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
for scale and let you know how quickly

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
for scale and let you know how quickly
they<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.119> travel<00:01:12.450> from<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> spawn<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they can travel from the spawn and of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
they can travel from the spawn and of
course<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> different<00:01:14.670> cat<00:01:14.850> points<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
course the different cat points and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
course the different cat points and
again<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:17.040> cover<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> holding

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
again all this cover is just a holding

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
again all this cover is just a holding
place<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:20.100> walls<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
place right now all these walls and of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
place right now all these walls and of
course<00:01:21.060> trees<00:01:21.390> may<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.810> may<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.140> moved<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
course trees may or may not be moved and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
course trees may or may not be moved and
this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> something<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> talked<00:01:24.659> about

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
this is something that we talked about

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
this is something that we talked about
in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> community<00:01:25.920> map<00:01:26.040> project<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.700> things

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
in the community map project what things

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.120 
in the community map project what things
did<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.380> map<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
did you want to have in this map well of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560 
did you want to have in this map well of
course<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> big

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
course you're going to see the big
waterfall<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> second<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
waterfall here in a second so kind of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
waterfall here in a second so kind of
take<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> look<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.829> reference<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.700> C<00:01:36.060> D<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
take a look at a in reference to C D and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
take a look at a in reference to C D and
E<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.409> five<00:01:37.770> flag<00:01:38.369> mat<00:01:39.000> which<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
E and this is a five flag mat which is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
E and this is a five flag mat which is
great<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.350> any<00:01:40.470> point<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:40.920> when

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
great because at any point time when

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.020 
great because at any point time when
teams<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.520> than<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.000> have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
teams more than like you could have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
teams more than like you could have
three<00:01:42.450> meaning<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:43.020> teams<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to

be on the bleed the worst thing at
battlefield<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:46.380> flags

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
battlefield is when there's four flags

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
battlefield is when there's four flags
or<00:01:46.920> six<00:01:47.159> flags<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> 33<00:01:48.390> hold<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:48.810> two

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
or six flags and it's a 33 hold or two

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
or six flags and it's a 33 hold or two
to<00:01:49.140> hold<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.670> only<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.030> bleeding

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
to hold and the only thing bleeding

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.880 
to hold and the only thing bleeding
those<00:01:51.720> tickets<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.259> people<00:01:52.380> swap<00:01:52.680> back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
those tickets is when people swap back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
those tickets is when people swap back
in<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> little

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
in so as you can see there's a little

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420 
in so as you can see there's a little
deep<00:01:54.570> water<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.200> which<00:01:55.470> may<00:01:55.860> mess<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.159> the

here's the waterfall at be again this is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
here's the waterfall at be again this is
about<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> cover<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> terrain<00:02:06.329> and

name a couple of maps that this feels

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.990 
name a couple of maps that this feels
like<00:02:28.290> question<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.519> the

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
hill on the right will this be one of

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.789 
hill on the right will this be one of

be<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:50.129> issue<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:51.389> this<00:02:51.510> specific<00:02:51.840> area<00:02:52.230> but

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
be one issue for this specific area but

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.979 
be one issue for this specific area but
this<00:02:52.680> ghost<00:02:52.980> town<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.489> actually<00:02:54.480> really

points<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.670> where<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.939> major<00:03:18.180> Fighting's

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
points is where all the major Fighting's

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.270 
points is where all the major Fighting's
gonna<00:03:18.629> be<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.139> on<00:03:19.470> those<00:03:19.590> cat<00:03:19.829> points<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
gonna be and on those cat points and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.949 
gonna be and on those cat points and
then<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.669> great<00:03:20.879> idea<00:03:21.180> there's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
then if you have a great idea there's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.259 
then if you have a great idea there's
something<00:03:22.290> brewing<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.099> your<00:03:23.220> head<00:03:23.459> they<00:03:24.000> want

something brewing in your head they want

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.369 
something brewing in your head they want
to<00:03:24.359> know<00:03:24.419> that<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.900> there's<00:03:25.049> actually<00:03:25.319> a

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
to know that and there's actually a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.629 
to know that and there's actually a
custom<00:03:25.709> form<00:03:25.949> for<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.220> I'm<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.519> give

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
custom form for this I'm going to give

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.979 
custom form for this I'm going to give

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
you a link down below and just like that

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.559 
you a link down below and just like that
they're<00:03:28.319> from<00:03:28.500> C<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.739> D<00:03:28.889> very<00:03:29.790> quickly<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
they're from C to D very quickly on the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.300 
they're from C to D very quickly on the
dirt<00:03:30.750> bikes<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.169> here<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.919> see<00:03:32.099> some

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
dirt bikes and here you see some

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.089 
dirt bikes and here you see some
probably<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.419> basic<00:03:34.379> cover<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.949> they're

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
probably just basic cover that they're

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.569 
probably just basic cover that they're
going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.310> drastically<00:03:35.909> change<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.949> D<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.159> E

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
going to drastically change so a D and E

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.430 
going to drastically change so a D and E
once<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:38.909> get<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.599> don't<00:03:39.810> have<00:03:39.959> much

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
once we get to it really don't have much

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.550 
once we get to it really don't have much
of<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:41.069> cover<00:03:41.449> so<00:03:42.449> kind<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.870> looking<00:03:43.109> at<00:03:43.260> here

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
of a cover so kind of looking at here

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.860 
of a cover so kind of looking at here
kind<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.889> like<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> log<00:03:44.459> area<00:03:44.879> logger<00:03:45.150> town<00:03:45.510> not

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
kind of like a log area logger town not

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.839 
kind of like a log area logger town not
really<00:03:46.260> much<00:03:46.409> going<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.669> like<00:03:47.819> that

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
really much going on and just like that

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.270 
really much going on and just like that
we're<00:03:48.150> off<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.510> eat<00:03:48.720> very<00:03:49.199> infantry<00:03:49.829> centric

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
we're off to eat very infantry centric

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.180 
we're off to eat very infantry centric
one<00:03:50.609> tank<00:03:50.940> no<00:03:51.329> air<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.349> be<00:03:52.500> interesting<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:52.979> see

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
one tank no air so be interesting to see

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.640 
one tank no air so be interesting to see
this<00:03:53.370> could<00:03:53.579> be<00:03:53.729> one<00:03:53.909> of<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.199> great<00:03:55.199> infantry

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
this could be one of the great infantry

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.770 
this could be one of the great infantry
maps<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:56.010> battlefield<00:03:56.370> 4<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.299> depends<00:03:57.720> on

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
maps of battlefield 4 it just depends on

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.839 
maps of battlefield 4 it just depends on
how<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.260> want<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.859> thing<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.099> change<00:03:59.489> and

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
how you want this thing to change and

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.969 
how you want this thing to change and

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
just like that we're on e not much going

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.680 
just like that we're on e not much going
on<00:04:02.069> here<00:04:02.280> probably<00:04:02.519> some<00:04:02.729> placeholder<00:04:03.030> cover

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
on here probably some placeholder cover

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.479 
on here probably some placeholder cover
so<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.680> your<00:04:04.769> community<00:04:05.250> map<00:04:05.459> project

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
so this is your community map project

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.789 
so this is your community map project
again<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.419> all<00:04:06.540> about<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> scale<00:04:07.229> map

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
again this is all about the scale map

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.399 
again this is all about the scale map
size<00:04:08.099> distances<00:04:09.030> between<00:04:09.269> flags<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.139> course

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
size distances between flags of course

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.670 
size distances between flags of course
the<00:04:10.889> rough<00:04:11.250> layouts<00:04:11.729> with<00:04:12.349> terrain<00:04:13.349> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
the rough layouts with terrain the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.469 
the rough layouts with terrain the
developers<00:04:14.099> really<00:04:14.699> need<00:04:15.060> your<00:04:15.209> feedback

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
what do you guys think I think for rough

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.879 
what do you guys think I think for rough
past<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.539> pretty<00:04:18.780> cool<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.320> ghost<00:04:19.620> town

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
past this is pretty cool that ghost town

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.740 
past this is pretty cool that ghost town
could<00:04:20.070> really<00:04:20.699> provide<00:04:20.970> some<00:04:21.180> epic<00:04:21.419> fights

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
could really provide some epic fights

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.089 
could really provide some epic fights
let's<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.469> what<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.710> do<00:04:22.770> with<00:04:22.889> the

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
let's see what they do with the

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.890 
let's see what they do with the
complementing<00:04:23.669> flags<00:04:24.029> because<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.389> always

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
complementing flags because it's always

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.960 
complementing flags because it's always
about<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.139> flag<00:04:25.409> of

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
about the flag of

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.210 
about the flag of
it's<00:04:26.300> pretty<00:04:26.630> linear<00:04:26.990> as<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.740> see<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> flight

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
it's pretty linear as you see the flight

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.940 
it's pretty linear as you see the flight
steering<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.700> very<00:04:28.850> low<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:29.870> be<00:04:30.410> interesting

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
steering is very low so be interesting

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.680 
steering is very low so be interesting
how<00:04:31.040> this<00:04:31.190> plays<00:04:31.430> out<00:04:31.610> as<00:04:31.760> always<00:04:32.330> youtubers
