I

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.870 

do<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.609> recognize<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:07.460> how<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> closer

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
do you recognize this how about a closer

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.259 
do you recognize this how about a closer
look<00:00:10.099> if<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.250> doesn't<00:00:11.519> look<00:00:11.580> familiar<00:00:11.759> don't

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
look if it doesn't look familiar don't

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480 
look if it doesn't look familiar don't
worry<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:13.260> is<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.710> president<00:00:14.309> dude

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
worry this is the one president dude

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
worry this is the one president dude

that look kind of cool type of my Malibu

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400 
that look kind of cool type of my Malibu
and<00:00:59.730> there's<00:01:00.090> no<00:01:00.270> shortage<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> cool<00:01:00.960> stuff<00:01:01.170> to

and there's no shortage of cool stuff to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
and there's no shortage of cool stuff to
see<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:02.820> rain<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
see like this well rain is a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.899 
see like this well rain is a
cool-looking<00:01:04.110> phenomenon<00:01:05.009> it<00:01:05.430> had<00:01:05.700> something

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
cool-looking phenomenon it had something

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
cool-looking phenomenon it had something
to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.570> material<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> being<00:01:07.560> put

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to do with how material is being put

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
to do with how material is being put
into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> prominent<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.539> technical

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
into the prominent that's the technical

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
into the prominent that's the technical
word<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.499> this<00:01:10.649> thing<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.639> now<00:01:11.789> it's<00:01:11.969> falling

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
word for this thing so now it's falling

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.469 
word for this thing so now it's falling
back<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.319> the<00:01:13.439> surface<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> sun

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.930 

and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.690> there<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:21.900> coronal<00:01:22.409> holes<00:01:22.940> well

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
and then there are coronal holes well

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.910 
and then there are coronal holes well
coronal<00:01:24.420> holes<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.050> my<00:01:25.170> favorite<00:01:25.560> thing<00:01:25.740> i

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
coronal holes are my favorite thing i

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
coronal holes are my favorite thing i
have<00:01:26.100> several<00:01:26.369> students<00:01:26.790> working<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.270> that
