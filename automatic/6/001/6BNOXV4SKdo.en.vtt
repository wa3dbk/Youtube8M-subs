00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
hey guys look from dealing me and today

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.970 
hey guys look from dealing me and today
I<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.969> little<00:00:12.330> build<00:00:12.690> that's<00:00:13.110> pretty<00:00:13.769> much

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
I have a little build that's pretty much

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.359 
I have a little build that's pretty much
just<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.610> hell<00:00:14.790> farm<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.859> made<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.100> bit

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
just a hell farm so I made it a bit

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.439 
just a hell farm so I made it a bit
bigger<00:00:17.550> than<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.880> would<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
bigger than you would have to but

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
bigger than you would have to but
basically<00:00:18.539> he<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:18.990> uses<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> 1<00:00:19.770> second<00:00:20.189> timer

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
basically he just uses a 1 second timer

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.640 
basically he just uses a 1 second timer
down<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> should<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.410> traps

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
down there and should start traps

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
down there and should start traps
everywhere<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> will<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.670> heaps<00:00:23.850> of

have an issue though show you three
times<00:01:09.450> teleport<00:01:10.049> probably<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.680> front<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> one

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

using super dart trewsy painted red yeah
this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.030> pretty<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> good

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is pretty much how to make a good

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320
