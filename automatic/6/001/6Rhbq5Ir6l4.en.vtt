00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.940
 I photographed you if you do 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 as I'm going to ask you for seven more 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.840
 first thing else wrong place does not give 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.640
 one step forward and an x in front of you 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.219
 these little bit more than that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 shows the board actually shooting 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:02.430
 This is cool now. Smile. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.430
 beautiful smiley hair also okay right 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.030
 Thank you and until the next girl won. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 there 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.680
 good luck then human as was the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.420
 selection was well it was called sticking 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 work or not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.759
 How are you going after the final model? 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 of bills 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.740
 Ayman SinhÃ¡ 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.869
 I do not know what I do was the tenth 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.119
 selection says that I went to this agency 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.700
 and so far nothing 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.369
 nobody calls me for any work 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.189
 I do not know what else to do but this is a 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.820
 How pylori absurd like what they want is 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:47.759
 not call you are semi sends in another 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 Tired moment of trying to understand myself 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 I think I should talk to the director of the agency. 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.860
 Prevention explains why no one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.899
 call me the end of tales 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.100
 so you want to talk to me without 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.149
 director 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 It happens that I've been at the table for 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.690
 registered in that agency and so far 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.680
 I got no model work 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.120
 I wanted to understand 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.609
 What's going on at last, goodbye? 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.879
 You need to answer that already. 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:27.000
 We send you to selections and nothing is 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.129
 you need to show some differential 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.079
 every day I get a lot of 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.510
 boys exactly like you 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.000
 wanting to turn into a night star for 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.219
 the day everything I see is one more 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.239
 skinny blonde blue-eyed pension 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.340
 end today 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.439
 Look at the bank, those girls are 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.650
 waiting for a test to join 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:55.200
 in the employed people tell the teachers 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.120
 students who dream of being famous 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 What you have is different from her. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.219
 password is obvious that I have everything right 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.739
 You too, I'm much prettier. 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:12.079
 more clean yield much 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.060
 intelligence much more the douro 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.400
 Good, my dear, you need to learn that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 To be a model is not just to be one more face 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.699
 pretty 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.919
 before anything else you need 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.379
 learn to be humble to listen very much 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.090
 but not if you think it is 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.280
 so beautiful that in her first selection 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.609
 someone would already take you to work 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.879
 on tv that is so to be a top model 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.970
 I scolded a lot I worked hard speeches 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.970
 too much not a very bag goal until 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.590
 getting to sof milan new york 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.299
 so girl 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.560
 thank you that I 'm still going to give it a chance 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.810
 for you 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:56.299
 the disease is so right thank you 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.299
 for your attention and until the next 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:21.630
 What happened in the account? 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.120
 I tell you, brother, who was shaking his head. 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.220
 I 've never been so immediate 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.360
 I am fine 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 I think it 's a different footprint than 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:39.690
 The other one was obama, I'll stay like this and 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:44.790
 It's not true, it's not true, it knows. 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:51.720
 which did not get very good if cute mona had 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:54.270
 quiet quiet quiet time is not so 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.810
 you go to the back over can 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.810
 stay calm 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.810
 thank you 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.280
 good morning class 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.250
 Welcome to the world. 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.950
 kimberley teacher of electricity and 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.720
 electronic compulsory 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.700
 physics course 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.880
 our little tour and how the thing 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.910
 difficult sometimes even rolling 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.770
 So study before we see it in practice. 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.570
 some components of the circuits that 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:37.770
 we will study, I want you to introduce yourself 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.780
 good my name is pink and I do not know well 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.380
 Because I came to take the course. 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.960
 physics but I think it 's because I had 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:50.180
 few candidates per job and I found 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.180
 that it was going to be easy to pass in the entrance exam 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.360
 It's a daniel show and I decided to do it. 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.390
 because I always liked 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 watching the stars of the sky is something 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.130
 I love it and I thought it would be a good 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.730
 idea to physics course to 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.730
 deepen 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.430
 so many choose the area for it and if 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.500
 disappoint because today you only do 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.830
 astronomy by computer 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.620
 My name is Marina and I chose it. 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.660
 do physics because I've had a lot of 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:29.580
 difficulty of this subject in the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:32.250
 I had to get over it and I just 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.620
 liking it and I thought it would be an area 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.010
 interesting since I could 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.510
 deepening and custom enhancing each 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.410
 one more time 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.260
 studying always, thank you very much, thank you 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.810
 Maria, very beautiful, your testimony, but if 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.090
 Did you have difficulty at school? It's good. 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.930
 start studying hard you will 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.930
 We need 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:13.020
 emotions of university life 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.020
 Okaloo Okay, Okay.
