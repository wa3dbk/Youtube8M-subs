3d<00:00:15.780> printing<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> most<00:00:16.920> exciting

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
3d printing is one of the most exciting

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.480 
3d printing is one of the most exciting
technologies<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> market<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.220> so

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
technologies on the market it's so

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
technologies on the market it's so
disruptive<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.480> has<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> potential<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
disruptive it has the potential to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.910 
disruptive it has the potential to
change<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.460> way<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.970> create<00:00:24.590> consume<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
change the way we create consume and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.849 
change the way we create consume and
recycle<00:00:26.580> everyday<00:00:27.000> products<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.560> wanted

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
recycle everyday products so we wanted

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.569 
recycle everyday products so we wanted
to<00:00:28.920> create<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:29.849> immersive<00:00:31.579> installation

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to create a very immersive installation

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.380 
to create a very immersive installation
that's<00:00:33.180> engaging<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.550> 3d<00:00:35.940> printing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that's engaging people with 3d printing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
that's engaging people with 3d printing
just<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.870> give<00:00:37.230> people<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.649> opportunity<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
just to give people the opportunity to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520 
just to give people the opportunity to
experience<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.300> technology<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> lot

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
experience the technology because a lot

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.440 
experience the technology because a lot
of<00:00:40.649> people<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.129> heard<00:00:41.399> about<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.149> not

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
of people have heard about it but not

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.270 

we've<00:00:51.449> been<00:00:51.750> researching<00:00:52.320> 3d<00:00:52.710> printing<00:00:53.250> for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we've been researching 3d printing for

we've been researching 3d printing for
quite<00:00:54.269> some<00:00:54.479> time<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.229> we<00:00:55.800> set<00:00:56.129> together<00:00:56.309> with

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
quite some time and we set together with

around<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.140> surveillance<00:01:10.740> that's<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> we

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
around there surveillance that's it we

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
around there surveillance that's it we
then<00:01:11.520> took<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> data<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:12.539> the<00:01:12.630> computers

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
then took the data into the computers

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
then took the data into the computers
and<00:01:13.470> took<00:01:14.009> them<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.610> 3d<00:01:15.030> printers<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and took them out into 3d printers in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.490 
and took them out into 3d printers in
Princeton<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.289> sought

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
Princeton that was little what we sought

Princeton that was little what we sought
to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.850> scanning<00:01:21.090> rig<00:01:21.420> actually

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to do with the the scanning rig actually

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.070 
to do with the the scanning rig actually
was<00:01:22.819> just<00:01:23.819> a<00:01:23.909> demonstration<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.690> proof<00:01:24.899> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
was just a demonstration of proof of

makes people I thought of women because

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.710 
makes people I thought of women because
they<00:02:10.830> are<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.070> quintessential<00:02:11.580> creators<00:02:12.270> of

they are the quintessential creators of
life<00:02:13.320> but<00:02:13.890> also<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.850> idea<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.240> technology<00:02:15.840> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
life but also the idea of technology is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
life but also the idea of technology is
usually<00:02:16.250> associated<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.400> something<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
usually associated with something very

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.630 
usually associated with something very
angular<00:02:18.570> very<00:02:19.020> masculine<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.220> wanted<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
angular very masculine and I wanted to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
angular very masculine and I wanted to
have<00:02:20.760> something<00:02:21.000> completely<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.840> opposite

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
have something completely the opposite

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
have something completely the opposite
of<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.920> something<00:02:23.280> very<00:02:23.310> curvy

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
of that so something very curvy

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.690 
of that so something very curvy
voluptuous<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.230> also<00:02:25.830> underlined<00:02:26.520> the

voluptuous and also underlined the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.110 
voluptuous and also underlined the
strength<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.270> women<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.580> model<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
strength of women this is the model that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.580 
strength of women this is the model that
I<00:02:30.780> created<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.970> maquette<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> break

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
I created for a maquette for the break

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.850 
I created for a maquette for the break
the<00:02:34.740> mold<00:02:34.920> installation<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.170> idea<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the mold installation and so the idea is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the mold installation and so the idea is
that<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:39.090> could<00:02:39.270> go<00:02:39.480> inside<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.260> belly<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
that you could go inside the belly and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
that you could go inside the belly and
be<00:02:41.880> recreated<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.170> experience<00:02:43.710> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
be recreated and have the experience of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130 
be recreated and have the experience of
going<00:02:44.070> back<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> womb<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.630> something

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
going back to the womb it's something

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.680 
going back to the womb it's something
that<00:02:46.320> nobody<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.220> us<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.700> ever<00:02:48.150> experience

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that nobody of us can ever experience

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.880 
that nobody of us can ever experience
