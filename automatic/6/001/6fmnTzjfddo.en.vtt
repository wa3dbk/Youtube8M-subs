00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.219
 Since next year, the building itself is already one 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.069
 It's out of range. 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 By Lee Jae-ho, only landmarks and 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.819
 The inside glass window will close the deadline. 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.310
 Expression itself 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.579
 women that conventional 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.489
 Differentiated tasks are different 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.760
 I had an event. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.730
 By the way, 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 today 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.270
 I tried to fill my face with 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.910
 Work 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.280
 It's a self-purification tower. 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 Think about it. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.120
 Before this door 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.700
 like that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.510
 Sparkling 8th joint 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.410
 Imagine a standing scene 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.720
 The way to the top of the tower 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.570
 It's not true. 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.290
 Next year 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 The reporters include the 10th floor stone tower of the mad cow disease angel. 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.920
 Sitting in various towers 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.970
 They 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.380
 Is it something we built and built? 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.640
 I'm falling asleep. 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.830
 Champontak 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.640
 Besides 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.000
 fifa times 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 Exterior 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 Decorating colors 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 It is golden. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.190
 This work is on the foundation of the previous year. 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.400
 Not. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 Square 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.270
 Do not let him stand next to you and look closer. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 I have a lot of stories. 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 He said he could peek a little closer. 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 List I have. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.630
 April domestic demand recovery 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.850
 Architectural timber 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.210
 Next to the pagoda 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.370
 Come up in the process of caring and we can see most of 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.650
 pick 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.480
 I can meet scholars. 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.990
 It is not a pagoda, but a golden tower. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.620
 It's not really the right thing to do, 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 I have the sheep because of the environment. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.240
 So, the traditional rice that was 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 Stone tower forms 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.690
 I have championships in various positions. 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.899
 I was out of that golden color. 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.439
 Is 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.949
 August Modern 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.809
 Some examples of works of art 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.499
 It's called borrowing of tradition. 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.929
 The next thing is to scramble 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.139
 There is a culture called champon 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.249
 We think of gold 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.249
 Backward-looking image 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.689
 A snob 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.169
 These are all demonstrations. 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.829
 So this work 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.579
 I can not stand in the front yard of Millennium Tower 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.899
 At Lotte shopping yard 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.180
 I was standing there. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.849
 Sihwa district 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.899
 Postmodern aiming works 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.189
 Acceptable in public 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.919
 It's got less money. 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.799
 It is a group of art experts 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.099
 I think the citizens of Gun c are going to get a lot of money. 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.389
 Thinking it's fun 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.879
 You can have a little kid. 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.159
 Having found the imagination 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.589
 The stereotypes of our art 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.749
 This work 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.680
 Accept or 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.659
 I did not feel like doing it.
