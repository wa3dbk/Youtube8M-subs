 this water no one did not refuse anything but to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.260
 Unfortunately, that is the situation that is today 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.810
 it really happened 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.660
 non-standard for Russia must be considered 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.190
 our bureaucracy is still 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.360
 so the documents are still on 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 continues to remain in the transit zone 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.930
 Sheremetyevo so safer for him we

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.650
 very seriously take care of their 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 security and probably really in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.780
 currently transit zone to him 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.410

 his words, snowdon took up the study 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.760
 Russian but he lawyer weight gain 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.350
 novel of Dostoevsky's crime 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.970
 punishment apparently there can be an image 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.130
 Raskolnikov causes what will cause 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 some kind of association again given by words 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.160
 the coachmen and the collection of Chekhov's collection and books 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.050

 it again given Sheremetyevo imposes 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.900
 a certain imprint on his 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.940
 psychological state but not 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.710
 less he hopes soon judging 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.400
 waiting for the decision of the immigration authorities 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.770
