00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
blood vessels blare ma'am you think I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.500 
blood vessels blare ma'am you think I
must<00:02:19.709> get<00:02:19.950> into<00:02:20.100> my<00:02:20.310> heart<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.450> you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
must get into my heart and so you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570 
must get into my heart and so you
remember<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.200> technique<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.890> go<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
remember this technique and you go and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.220 
remember this technique and you go and
if<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.510> doesn't<00:02:24.750> work<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.380> go<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.680> this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
if that doesn't work you go like this

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
if that doesn't work you go like this
and<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> many<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:29.700> colleagues

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and because of many of your colleagues

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
and because of many of your colleagues
here<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.050> see<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.680> colleagues

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
here if you see one of your colleagues

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.479 
here if you see one of your colleagues
looking<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.550> at<00:02:32.610> work<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:34.130> from<00:02:35.130> now<00:02:35.280> on

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
looking to you at work going from now on

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.640 
looking to you at work going from now on
you<00:02:35.940> know<00:02:36.120> exactly<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.840> they're<00:02:37.019> doing<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you know exactly what they're doing and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.910 
you know exactly what they're doing and
so<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.670> technique<00:02:39.150> silly<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:39.989> sounds<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
so this technique silly as it sounds it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.229 
so this technique silly as it sounds it
really<00:02:40.980> does<00:02:41.459> help<00:02:41.640> reduce<00:02:41.970> your<00:02:42.000> blood

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
really does help reduce your blood

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.570 
really does help reduce your blood
pressure<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.840> help<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.470> connect<00:02:43.890> heart<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
pressure and help you connect heart to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.520 
pressure and help you connect heart to
heart<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.269> everybody<00:02:45.930> else<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.410> you

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
heart with everybody else and when you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.380 
heart with everybody else and when you
get<00:02:46.650> heart<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.070> heart<00:02:47.340> connection<00:02:47.519> it's<00:02:48.060> when

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
get heart to heart connection it's when

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.960 
get heart to heart connection it's when
you<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.660> true<00:02:49.140> communication<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.459> I'll<00:02:50.790> give

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
you get true communication so I'll give

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.340 
you get true communication so I'll give
you<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> symbol<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.510> heart<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.140> stay

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
you the symbol for heart can you stay

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.720 
you the symbol for heart can you stay
connected<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.830> your<00:02:52.950> cells<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.340> just
