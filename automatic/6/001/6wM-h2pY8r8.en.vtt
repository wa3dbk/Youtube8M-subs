00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
pretty cool and you can dim that if you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580 
pretty cool and you can dim that if you
want<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.410> bring

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you probably want to know there we go

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
you probably want to know there we go
right<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.360> we're<00:00:39.510> looking<00:00:39.780> at

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's a 64-bit operating system of course

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's a 64-bit operating system of course
and<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.780> there's<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> model<00:00:52.469> number<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and right there's that model number I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.869 
and right there's that model number I
was<00:00:52.890> telling<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> about<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.870> g73<00:00:54.890> SW<00:00:55.890> there's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
was telling you about the g73 SW there's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
was telling you about the g73 SW there's
a<00:00:56.940> couple<00:00:57.120> quick<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> case<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
a couple quick things about the case I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.389 
a couple quick things about the case I
thought<00:00:58.379> I'd<00:00:58.500> point<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.250> it's

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
thought I'd point out first of all it's

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
thought I'd point out first of all it's
very<00:00:59.460> robust<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
very robust you can see that it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.509 
very robust you can see that it's
rubberized<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.780> top<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
rubberized up here on the top and it's a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.149 
rubberized up here on the top and it's a
pretty<00:01:05.850> heavy-duty<00:01:06.150> machine<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.710> big

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
pretty heavy-duty machine now it is big

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.950 
pretty heavy-duty machine now it is big
I<00:01:08.400> understand<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> big<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> clunky<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I understand it's big and clunky and I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.090 
I understand it's big and clunky and I
didn't<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> big<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> clunky

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
didn't really want a big and clunky

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
didn't really want a big and clunky
machine<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> weighs<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.939> 11<00:01:12.540> pounds<00:01:13.020> or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
machine it weighs like 11 pounds or

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
machine it weighs like 11 pounds or
something<00:01:13.260> ridiculous<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.119> check

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
something ridiculous like that but check

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
something ridiculous like that but check

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the laptop that I thought were kind of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.550

interesting<00:01:51.390> first<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.930> right<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.200> we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
interesting first of all right here we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
interesting first of all right here we
have<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.950> subwoofer<00:01:53.700> believe<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.540> yeah

have a subwoofer believe it or not yeah
subwoofer<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.549> probably<00:01:57.000> only<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
subwoofer it's probably only about that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
subwoofer it's probably only about that
big<00:01:57.840> around<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> adds<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
big around but it adds a little bit of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
big around but it adds a little bit of
bass<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> laptop<00:02:00.329> sound<00:02:00.990> system<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:02.159> like

for<00:02:55.170> fun<00:02:55.380> let's<00:02:55.410> see<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.830> subwoofer

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
for fun let's see what that subwoofer

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:07.160 
for fun let's see what that subwoofer
does<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.060> us<00:03:04.370> right<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.989> hear<00:03:07.140> a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
does for us right here you can hear a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:19.120 
does for us right here you can hear a
little<00:03:07.440> tab<00:03:07.650> any<00:03:08.489> much<00:03:09.200> but<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.320> something

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.920 

so<00:03:20.130> that's<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.519> new<00:03:20.640> laptop<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.360> think<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.780> made

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
so that's the new laptop I think I made

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.140 
so that's the new laptop I think I made
a<00:03:21.959> smart<00:03:22.230> choice<00:03:22.350> what<00:03:23.070> do<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.640> think

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
a smart choice what do you think I think

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.550 
a smart choice what do you think I think
a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> probably<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.380> should

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
a lot of you probably think I should

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.319 
a lot of you probably think I should
have<00:03:25.650> gotten<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.890> Mac<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:26.910> can't<00:03:27.180> get

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
have gotten a Mac but I just can't get

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.699 
have gotten a Mac but I just can't get
that<00:03:27.510> kind<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.750> storage<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.260> Mac<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that kind of storage in a Mac at a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.000 
that kind of storage in a Mac at a
feasible<00:03:29.190> price<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:30.150> thing<00:03:30.450> cost<00:03:30.690> me<00:03:31.010> $1,300

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
feasible price this thing cost me $1,300

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280 
feasible price this thing cost me $1,300
so<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.150> enough<00:03:33.390> money<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.870> me<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.079> spend

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
so that was enough money for me to spend

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.350 
so that was enough money for me to spend
plus<00:03:34.829> an<00:03:34.980> additional<00:03:35.070> hard<00:03:35.579> variable<00:03:35.940> cost<00:03:36.180> me

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
plus an additional hard variable cost me
