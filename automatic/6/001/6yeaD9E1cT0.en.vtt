a<00:02:13.410> little<00:02:13.890> tip<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> guys<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.780> if<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.930> tell

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
a little tip for you guys is if you tell

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.380 
a little tip for you guys is if you tell
as<00:02:16.440> far<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:16.830> possible<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.460> go<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.210> little

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
as far as possible you go for a little

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.600 
as far as possible you go for a little
bit<00:02:18.570> until<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> start<00:02:19.610> accelerating

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
bit until you have to start accelerating

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
bit until you have to start accelerating
because<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> clock<00:02:21.480> starts<00:02:21.930> when<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
because the clock starts when you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.980 
because the clock starts when you
accelerate<00:02:22.970> timer<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.210> it's<00:02:24.300> easier<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
accelerate timer so it's easier for you

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.700 
accelerate timer so it's easier for you
