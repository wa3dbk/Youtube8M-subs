they've<00:01:23.520> taken<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> fiber

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
they've taken out a lot of the fiber

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.429

this smart car one bread has 109
calories<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.560> new<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> think<00:01:32.360> 90

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
calories the new one has I think 90

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.380 
calories the new one has I think 90
calories<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.920> seems<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.729> good

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
calories so that seems like a good

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.490 
calories so that seems like a good
choice<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:39.900> fiber<00:01:40.200> as

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
choice right this one has more fiber as

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
choice right this one has more fiber as
opposed<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> other<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.150> regardless

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
opposed to the other one but regardless

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
opposed to the other one but regardless
of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.829> nutritional<00:01:44.340> information<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of the nutritional information it has to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
of the nutritional information it has to
taste<00:01:45.750> somewhat<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:46.979> want

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
taste somewhat good right you don't want

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.340 
taste somewhat good right you don't want
to<00:01:47.399> eat<00:01:48.090> something<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.509> tastes<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.990> crap

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to eat something that tastes like crap

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
to eat something that tastes like crap
that<00:01:49.590> defeats<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> whole<00:01:50.100> purpose<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that defeats the whole purpose and it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
that defeats the whole purpose and it
makes<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> harder<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> stay<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> diet<00:01:52.409> so

the<00:03:30.829> $8<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.489> pick<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.880> up<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.230> demonstrate<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
the $8 to pick it up and demonstrate and

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.250 
the $8 to pick it up and demonstrate and
waste<00:03:34.519> my<00:03:34.700> money<00:03:35.000> because<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.600> know<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:36.079> is

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
waste my money because I know that is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.140 
waste my money because I know that is
probably<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.739> shitty<00:03:36.980> product<00:03:37.310> if<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.880> buy<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
probably a shitty product if I buy the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.420 
probably a shitty product if I buy the
product<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:38.989> because<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.620> can't<00:03:39.860> return<00:03:40.190> it

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
product and because I can't return it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.550 
product and because I can't return it
I'm<00:03:40.700> actually<00:03:41.030> endorsing<00:03:41.690> their<00:03:41.959> product<00:03:42.410> and

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
I'm actually endorsing their product and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440 
I'm actually endorsing their product and
I'm<00:03:42.709> hoping<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.730> sales<00:03:44.030> go<00:03:44.420> down

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
I'm hoping that the sales go down

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
I'm hoping that the sales go down
tremendously<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.250> happens

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
tremendously and if that happens

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.090 
tremendously and if that happens
Julianne<00:03:47.690> bakery<00:03:48.019> will<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> hint<00:03:48.799> and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
Julianne bakery will get a hint and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.280 
Julianne bakery will get a hint and
they'll<00:03:49.519> go<00:03:49.700> back<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.239> old<00:03:50.420> four

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
they'll go back to the old four

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.830 
they'll go back to the old four
now<00:03:51.470> I'm<00:03:51.650> pretty<00:03:51.890> sure<00:03:52.310> across<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.360> board<00:03:53.630> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
now I'm pretty sure across the board and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.350 
now I'm pretty sure across the board and
across<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.230> country<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.670> new<00:03:55.819> formula

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
across the country that the new formula

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.960 
across the country that the new formula
is<00:03:56.600> already<00:03:57.020> you<00:03:57.380> know<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:57.740> place<00:03:58.069> however<00:03:58.610> you

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
is already you know in place however you

the main thing that you want to look for

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.130 
the main thing that you want to look for
I<00:04:06.980> don't<00:04:07.489> have<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.120> packaging<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.020> new

I don't have the packaging of the new

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.050 
I don't have the packaging of the new
formula<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.160> instance<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.790> smart

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
formula but for instance for the smart

to look is for the fiber the older

to look is for the fiber the older
formula<00:04:15.980> I've<00:04:16.160> noticed<00:04:16.579> has<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.299> know<00:04:17.389> at

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
formula I've noticed has you know at

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.409 
formula I've noticed has you know at
least<00:04:17.660> 10<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.410> 13<00:04:18.889> grams<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.370> fiber<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:20.030> new

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
least 10 to 13 grams of fiber the new

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.120 
least 10 to 13 grams of fiber the new
formula<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.139> basically<00:04:21.470> took<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.919> fiber

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
formula they basically took the fiber

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.370 
formula they basically took the fiber
out<00:04:22.280> if<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:22.910> do<00:04:23.120> want<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.419> try<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.780> julienne

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
out if you do want to try the julienne

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.670 
out if you do want to try the julienne
bakery<00:04:24.770> bread<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.570> hope<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.560> know<00:04:27.650> you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
bakery bread and hope that you know you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320 
bakery bread and hope that you know you
get<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.130> old<00:04:28.220> formula<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.760> just<00:04:28.940> look<00:04:29.120> at<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
get the old formula I just look at the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.290 
get the old formula I just look at the
nutritional<00:04:29.810> information<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:32.030> fiber

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
nutritional information and if the fiber

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.260 
nutritional information and if the fiber
is<00:04:32.690> pretty<00:04:33.410> high<00:04:33.650> that's<00:04:34.130> probably<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.970> safe

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
is pretty high that's probably a safe

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.240 
is pretty high that's probably a safe
bet<00:04:35.480> that<00:04:35.540> it's<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.960> old<00:04:36.140> formula<00:04:36.680> all<00:04:37.070> right

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
bet that it's the old formula all right

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.560 
bet that it's the old formula all right
that's<00:04:37.460> about<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.820> for<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.090> video<00:04:38.360> and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
that's about it for this video and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.530 
that's about it for this video and
before<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.050> depart<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.650> do<00:04:39.710> want<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.100> say<00:04:40.280> that
