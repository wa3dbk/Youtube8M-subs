video<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:06.899> my<00:00:07.290> summer<00:00:07.589> project<00:00:07.799> number<00:00:08.580> one

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
video for my summer project number one

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.299 
video for my summer project number one
on<00:00:08.849> my<00:00:08.910> ECX<00:00:09.300> tournament<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:11.070> did<00:00:11.280> for

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
on my ECX tournament what I just did for

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.480 
on my ECX tournament what I just did for
it<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.240> added<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:13.620> preload<00:00:14.190> clips

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it is I added some more preload clips

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.070 
it is I added some more preload clips
from<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:14.820> traxxas<00:00:15.299> stampede<00:00:15.719> because<00:00:15.960> it's

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
from my traxxas stampede because it's

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.410 
from my traxxas stampede because it's
not<00:00:16.230> threaded<00:00:16.699> shocks<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.880> would<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.300> get

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
not threaded shocks I would like to get

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
not threaded shocks I would like to get
some<00:00:18.630> big<00:00:18.779> bore<00:00:18.990> threaded<00:00:19.380> shocks<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> but

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
some big bore threaded shocks for it but

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.480 
some big bore threaded shocks for it but
I<00:00:20.220> don't<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.699> will<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.949> 2s<00:00:23.460> lipo

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I don't know if I will I have a 2s lipo

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.650 
I don't know if I will I have a 2s lipo
15<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.840> current<00:00:26.840> 7.4<00:00:27.840> volt<00:00:29.480> standard<00:00:30.480> pack

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
15 see current 7.4 volt standard pack

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.490 
15 see current 7.4 volt standard pack
and<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.859> low<00:00:32.669> C<00:00:32.940> 17<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.940> 34<00:00:35.940> than<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> original

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and a low C 17 to 34 than the original

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.639 
and a low C 17 to 34 than the original
so<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:37.950> excel<00:00:39.350> lower<00:00:40.350> engine

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
so it's got more excel lower engine

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
so it's got more excel lower engine
temps<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> summer<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.149> but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
temps because it is summer right now but

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
temps because it is summer right now but
it's<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> morning<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> could<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's in the morning so I could be

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's in the morning so I could be
running<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.890> high<00:00:44.010> gear<00:00:44.280> ratio<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
running a high gear ratio but this is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.060 
running a high gear ratio but this is
basically<00:00:46.320> where<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.620> been<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
basically where I've just been kind of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.799 
basically where I've just been kind of
bashing<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.360> check<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bashing it but if you check out the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:59.509 
bashing it but if you check out the
torque<00:00:49.110> difference<00:00:49.789> it's<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:50.969> cool

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.649 

sorry<00:01:00.519> I'm<00:01:00.609> driving<00:01:00.879> one-handed<00:01:01.359> right<00:01:01.510> now

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
sorry I'm driving one-handed right now

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:23.860 
sorry I'm driving one-handed right now
so

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.710 

and<00:01:24.870> I<00:01:25.200> did<00:01:25.500> order<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> 4,000<00:01:26.790> kV<00:01:27.180> censored

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and I did order a 4,000 kV censored

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I did order a 4,000 kV censored
brushless<00:01:28.500> motor<00:01:29.090> that<00:01:30.090> should<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.300> coming<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
brushless motor that should be coming in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.190 
brushless motor that should be coming in
a<00:01:30.750> couple<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.050> days<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:32.540> ESC<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a couple of days and a ESC for it so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
a couple of days and a ESC for it so
I'll<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> brushless<00:01:35.130> video<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I'll have a brushless video on this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
I'll have a brushless video on this
pretty<00:01:36.869> soon<00:01:37.110> hopefully<00:01:37.410> but<00:01:37.920> yeah<00:01:38.160> it's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pretty soon hopefully but yeah it's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.840 
pretty soon hopefully but yeah it's
pretty<00:01:38.759> cool<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.520> can't<00:01:41.520> wait<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pretty cool right now so can't wait to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.210 
pretty cool right now so can't wait to
see<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> brushless<00:01:42.420> system<00:01:43.080> put<00:01:43.890> into<00:01:44.190> it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
see the brushless system put into it

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.380 
see the brushless system put into it
it'll<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.600> just<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.899> overpowered<00:01:50.390> then

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it'll be just really overpowered then

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.080 
it'll be just really overpowered then
hopefully<00:01:52.070> got<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.160> stuck<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.610> gonna<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:53.880> grab

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
hopefully got it stuck I'm gonna go grab

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.150 
hopefully got it stuck I'm gonna go grab
it<00:01:54.300> but<00:01:54.780> while<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.170> grabbing<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
it but while I'm grabbing it I want to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.430 
it but while I'm grabbing it I want to
