drive or have octave or have any effect
the<00:01:09.000> bottom<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.350> drop<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.820> they

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the bottom will drop out and so they

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090

actually turn these you see this is
tri-colored<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.819> that's<00:02:11.819> everything<00:02:12.240> off

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
tri-colored so that's everything off

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.440 
tri-colored so that's everything off
right<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:14.819> we've<00:02:14.970> got<00:02:15.180> octave<00:02:15.840> only

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.240 

one<00:02:23.450> thing<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.690> discovered<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.290> messing<00:02:25.160> around

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
one thing I discovered in messing around

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.430 
one thing I discovered in messing around
with<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.060> go<00:02:26.599> all<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.870> way

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
with this is that if you go all the way

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.020 
with this is that if you go all the way
well<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> mix<00:02:28.550> all<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.760> way<00:02:28.880> off

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
well this is the mix all the way off

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.729 
well this is the mix all the way off
those<00:02:29.300> values<00:02:31.150> that's<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.420> based<00:02:32.599> on<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
those values that's just based on and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.820 
those values that's just based on and
then<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.010> go<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.030> up<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:36.349> gets<00:02:36.500> into<00:02:36.800> a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
then we go all the way up it gets into a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.050 
then we go all the way up it gets into a
keyboard<00:02:37.310> kind<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.640> thing<00:02:42.670> which<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.700> pretty

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
keyboard kind of thing which is pretty

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.220 
keyboard kind of thing which is pretty
cool<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.450> then<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.660> course<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.930> blend<00:02:45.140> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
cool and then of course you blend it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.800 
cool and then of course you blend it
back<00:02:45.380> in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.540 

and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.660> get<00:02:54.840> dirty<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.530> let's<00:02:56.190> activate

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and then we get dirty so let's activate

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.790 
and then we get dirty so let's activate
the<00:02:56.819> drive

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.710 

so<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.400> gets<00:03:05.580> pretty<00:03:05.820> nasty<00:03:06.300> let's<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.600> ahead

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
so that gets pretty nasty let's go ahead

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.240 
so that gets pretty nasty let's go ahead
and<00:03:06.930> go<00:03:07.860> drive<00:03:08.070> only

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:29.020 

we're<00:03:14.250> gonna<00:03:14.340> go<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.360> mix

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:46.720 

an<00:03:29.810> hour<00:03:30.020> full-bore<00:03:30.530> straight<00:03:31.160> job

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.430 

take<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.480> some<00:03:47.510> different<00:03:47.750> character<00:03:48.260> let's

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
take on some different character let's

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.199 
take on some different character let's
put<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.739> back<00:03:48.920> up

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.199 

that's<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.299> overall<00:03:53.390> boy

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.830 

of<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.079> drive

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:34.860 

this<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.110> character<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> driver

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.870 

so<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.620> snuck<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:35.980> little<00:04:36.100> bit<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.550> original

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
so I snuck a little bit of the original

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.210 
so I snuck a little bit of the original
tone<00:04:37.000> back<00:04:37.180> in<00:04:37.449> I<00:04:37.480> pulled<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.870> tone<00:04:38.050> back<00:04:38.260> off

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.130 

and<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.370> sounds<00:04:46.850> pretty<00:04:47.180> darn<00:04:47.660> good<00:04:47.930> it's

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
and that sounds pretty darn good it's

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.280 
and that sounds pretty darn good it's
pretty<00:04:48.380> heavy<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.770> pretty<00:04:49.550> dirty<00:04:49.810> again<00:04:50.810> this

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
pretty heavy and pretty dirty again this

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:59.200 
pretty heavy and pretty dirty again this
means<00:04:51.500> both<00:04:51.920> are<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.790> you're<00:04:58.940> back<00:04:59.180> in

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
means both are on and you're back in

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.600 
means both are on and you're back in
octave<00:04:59.720> land<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.290> then<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.800> can<00:05:00.980> go<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.490> know

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
octave land and then you can go you know

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:09.850 
octave land and then you can go you know
sky<00:05:01.940> high

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.440 

with<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.040> with<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.640> octaves<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.210> blending

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
with the with the octaves and blending

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.870 
with the with the octaves and blending
this<00:05:12.540> all<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.840> way<00:05:12.930> up<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.380> it's<00:05:13.950> pretty<00:05:14.580> fun<00:05:14.850> I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
mean if you just need the octave pedal

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.990 
mean if you just need the octave pedal

arrange or a nice range of control
especially<00:05:31.320> with<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.950> mix<00:05:32.190> because<00:05:32.430> that's

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
especially with the mix because that's
