00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.539
 hello this guitar club alexis 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.970
 we're here at the tennessee studio so you 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.710
 present a gibson and I have 74 so 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.539
 a year nice enough for him to ring 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.180
 so as we can see at a not bad 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.239
 aged she was pretty much played so what 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.190
 who makes her charm so one so she 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.840
 is not quite young 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 little particularity is that we have two 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.819
 mining hamburgers and a bixby gibson and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.719
 not that we can see it by gbi com 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.030
 on others 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.190
 gipson so you do a little 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.210
 prone demonstration and then saturate 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.210
 therefore in the neck position 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
 a 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.740
 m 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.300
 intermediate position 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.600
 Yes 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240
 aie 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 the acute position 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.180
 m 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.330
 we will see the saturated part in position 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.330
 handle 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.900
 an intermediate position 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.870
 but 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.590
 and acute opposition 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.129
 m 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.500
 m 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.530
 so that's what was 7 gipson 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.390
 so also interesting particularity 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.630
 is that as we can see she 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.650
 responds very well in the treble 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.910
 just minimal duo cure so it is 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.280
 a guitar that I advise you to 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 come try because is really worth it 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.190
 detour she 's not at all the same are 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.870
 a gibson that we can meet 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.040
 Year of the least recent 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.040
 Thank you and see you soon
