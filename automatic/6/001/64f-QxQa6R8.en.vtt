00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.400
 Hello everyone, I am Musashi Yuka. 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.430
 I am getting annoyed by a lot of things now. 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.231
 I feel like I can't do a lot of things (suddenly, I am sorry) 

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:11.600
 I feel very upset tomorrow. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 Those... just come and eat it. 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.422
 (plastic wrap) 

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:25.560
 Today I have to eat 100 chicken nuggets. 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.346
 Moss is Mos's chicken 喔

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:30.008
 Come eat it. 

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:33.528
 Every time I go to work, I will pile up a lot of work (because I have a lot of reservations, I am afraid that the store is busy, but I have to make an appointment first) 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.026
 Ordinary people may only spend about 30% of their strength... 

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.008
 I am doing my best every day. 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.020
 (General people spend) 30% strength can solve things 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.022
 I am trying my best to finish it. (What exactly is this person talking about...) 

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:54.862
 If ordinary people want 50% to solve things, my words may be exhausted to death. 

00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:59.440
 It doesn't matter. 

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:02.035
 As long as you are willing to do something unexpected, there is nothing you can't do. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.377
 However, if you think too much, you will soon "wow~" 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.995
 But I am completely fine. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.204
 It’s too boring to sort out these processes. I’m going to drop the video. 

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:18.560
 Finished 100 chicken pieces 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.413
 My mood has stabilized after finishing 100 chicken pieces. 

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:25.182
 Let's learn from it (new discovery: the mood is calm after finishing 100 chickens) 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.017
 Because there is no time, I will eat soon. 

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:31.920
 I want to start 啰

00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:39.800
 (good to eat) 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.350
 I won’t lose if I eat it. 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.697
 Let’s take a look at the time. 

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:50.977
 Really not intentional... (It feels better to go to a hospital) 

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:53.253
 This is a routine 

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:54.852
 Then 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.551
 START 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 Let’s yellow mustard sauce 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.822
 Moss' sauce is delicious. 

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:10.311
 Although the other is delicious too. 

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:13.573
 Sure enough, it is still delicious. 

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:15.768
 All are delicious 

00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:21.111
 The color of this yellow mustard sauce 

00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:26.008
 The color of this yellow mustard sauce is quite powerful. 

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:27.760
 What is the color to call? 

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.142
 Is this said to be unique or Yellow? 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 Change the BBQ sauce 

00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:44.444
 My words are BBQ sauce... Morse, I still prefer BBQ sauce. 

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:52.800
 Mentioning Morse's chicken nuggets 

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:56.400
 It’s delicious after it’s cold. 

00:02:57.164 --> 00:02:58.017
 Amazing 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.995
 It’s just 50 now. 

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:20.960
 It has taken 16 minutes 

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:26.186
 Feeling still delicious 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.115
 What happened 

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:49.208
 I am sorry! The camera problem with the mystery has been interrupted after four photos have been eaten... 

00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:57.940
 Then there are still ten 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.804
 Great 

00:04:18.728 --> 00:04:20.977
 The last one 

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:25.804
 I want to eat 啰

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.183
 I finished eating 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.257
 Sure enough, 100 chicken nuggets... 

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.351
 It’s very easy to eat. 

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:42.657
 Very delicious 

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.168
 Then...thank you for watching today 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.471
 If you feel good, please press Good button and subscribe to the channel. 

00:04:50.684 --> 00:04:52.880
 Bye bye~~~ 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.368
 It’s so bad, bad. 

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:57.804
 It has become a practice, it is true. 

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:04.025
 39 minutes and 48 seconds 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.577
 Every time after eating, because there is still a lot to do 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.848
 As a result, the test room sneaked 

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:12.640
 Stolen? 

00:05:13.155 --> 00:05:15.137
 Stop the timing of the code table too late 

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:19.066
 Ah, the opposite of stealing, it should be said to be anti-stolen. 

00:05:20.008 --> 00:05:23.590
 Well, it’s just a good time to offset it. (Note: I forgot to stop at the beginning and forget to stop) 

00:05:24.142 --> 00:05:25.226
 Then everyone 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.400
 Goodbye~
