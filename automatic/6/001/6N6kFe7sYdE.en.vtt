lace and loop that over and then do it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.030 
lace and loop that over and then do it
on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> opposite<00:00:41.730> side<00:00:42.649> once<00:00:43.649> you've<00:00:43.800> done

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040

then loop that lace up and over the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220 
then loop that lace up and over the
first<00:00:53.160> loop<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> made<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.079> going

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
first loop that you made so you're going

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.450 
first loop that you made so you're going
to<00:00:55.320> loop<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.399> over<00:00:58.070> once<00:00:59.070> you've<00:00:59.219> done

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to loop up and over once you've done

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
to loop up and over once you've done
that<00:00:59.520> pull<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> other<00:01:00.660> side<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that pull on the other side and do the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850 
that pull on the other side and do the
same<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> basically<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
same thing so basically you're just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.620 
same thing so basically you're just
doing<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> same<00:01:05.339> technique<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> over

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
doing the same technique over and over

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.230 
doing the same technique over and over
nothing<00:01:07.140> fancy<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.850> once<00:01:08.850> you've<00:01:09.000> done<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
nothing fancy so once you've done that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.859 
nothing fancy so once you've done that
pull<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.170> four<00:01:10.500> sides<00:01:11.479> there<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
pull on all four sides there you go you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.899 
pull on all four sides there you go you
should<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> looks<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
should get something that looks like a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320 
should get something that looks like a
checkered<00:01:15.630> square<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.520> repeat<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> same

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
checkered square just repeat the same

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
checkered square just repeat the same
technique<00:01:18.630> until<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> reach<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> length

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
technique until you reach the length

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.469 
technique until you reach the length
that<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> next<00:01:24.330> I'm

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that you like and that's it so next I'm

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.910 
that you like and that's it so next I'm
going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> teach<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.080> how<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
going to teach you how to do it in a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.539 
going to teach you how to do it in a
different<00:01:26.070> way

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
different way

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.149

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pink one and then I measured out the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
pink one and then I measured out the
center<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.680> both<00:01:32.009> laces<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.729> folded<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> over

and then made a knot after that I'm just
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:37.020> square<00:01:37.290> weave<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
going to do the same square weave that I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
going to do the same square weave that I
did<00:01:37.979> earlier<00:01:38.400> until<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> reach<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> length

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
did earlier until I reach the length

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
did earlier until I reach the length
that<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.040> measuring

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that I like you see here I'm measuring

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
that I like you see here I'm measuring

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
and pink lanyards to see if I like both
their<00:01:47.340> links<00:01:47.960> keep<00:01:48.960> doing<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> same

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
their links keep doing the same

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
their links keep doing the same
technique<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.670> laces<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> you
