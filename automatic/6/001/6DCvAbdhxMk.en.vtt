00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 when we talked to the network and if in 2003 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 2004 all schools had their 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.540
 lab but she wants a little 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 in addition, and this possibility of 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.980
 federal government to have a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 pilot project on a computer by 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.280
 student 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.830
 since 2007 and January with support from intel 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.949
 But we work with Clement. 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.680
 today we have the expansion of this project in 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.730
 network in the 21 schools of piraÃ­ com 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.239
 6,200 students two years old reaching 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 15 year goal of the ministry of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 education in the ideb 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.479
 rice school she had the index 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.519
 the development of basic education in 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.710
 interest by the minister of education very 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.409
 and the implantation of what at school 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.990
 reached and drank 4.4 out and berg 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.420
 2.4 really was thus a result 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.820
 not only surprising and drinks evasion 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.170
 school discipline problems within 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 classroom 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.399
 then the three lie the student 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.530
 interests and says it is more curious and 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.210
 the spaces are more concentrated 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.609
 has multiplied 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.909
 I take a class with eight computers 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:32.850
 and I can walk through the city walks 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.829
 by the school itself and a museum 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.420
 culture and work a class within the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.310
 home of culture so I have 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.630
 possibility of thinking about a city 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.630
 educator a creative city 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.760
 people lives in the countryside and there 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.170
 we also have digital piracy there we 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.140
 we have one project one computer per student 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.600
 we can take the technology of the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.880
 information to lead an intelligent network to 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 all schools is a teaching with my 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.500
 fathers they said so ah but for me 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.810
 I'll learn but I will not move even if I'm tense. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.970
 I said no, father, everything in this life has a 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.369
 The way you're giving today 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.430
 the people of this rural 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.890
 to match is a person from one of a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.739
 large center of one of a city 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.540
 Big life for me was never easy. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.000
 before I thought my future mine 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.790
 Canada because a person living in the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.800
 farm does everything crops 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.690
 he thought he would not have the future now with 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 the arrival of these gracious in school I think 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.770
 that has changed a lot 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.360
 now I can see that life is not 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.510
 only for those who have but also 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.510
 those people who can 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.900
 everything today revolves around computing 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.090
 I'm not a carpenter. 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.569
 My son does not want to be a carpenter. 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.739
 sanfelice looks at the arm because it's your 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.209
 future is that there 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.040
 If I was 12 years old, it 's the opportunity. 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.340
 what are you doing today? 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.950
 I would suddenly have a better chance at 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.000
 So clement village is pumping here 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.700
 in the room, right? 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.379
 I'm really happy to see you here in the room. 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.260
 seeing my students concentrating on doing 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.950
 that is a good result at the end with 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.980
 sure contributed a lot to us 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.510
 we had the satisfaction return of the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.579
 population 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.030
 I think that's an example. 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.889
 To the world, Brazil and I are an example. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.889
 I mirror much in the results of 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.359
 program to try is taking today to 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.669
 inside the city of rio de janeiro 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.250
 I plan to when I left school are studying 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.470
 a college I want to be a doctor, I want 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.569
 What are medical schools? 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.819
 generates knowledge is the passion that from the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.989
 first time we did all this 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.659
 project with a lot of passion 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.819
 so we really believe and 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.079
 we bet I think what we people 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.079
 believes gives right right
