00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.999 
for you and that's why it's called the
one<00:01:46.890> step<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.210> got<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.170> color<00:01:49.500> tone

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
one step now I got it in the color tone

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.730 
one step now I got it in the color tone
and<00:01:50.460> their<00:01:51.119> color<00:01:51.360> selection<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.500> not

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and their color selection is kind of not

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.100 
and their color selection is kind of not
I<00:01:52.979> mean<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:54.000> vague<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.930> it's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I mean it's very vague a little bit it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
I mean it's very vague a little bit it's
like<00:01:55.350> light<00:01:55.700> tone<00:01:56.810> medium<00:01:57.810> tan<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.619> dark<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like light tone medium tan and dark I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.179 
like light tone medium tan and dark I
mean<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.850> know<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.210> basic<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.619> had<00:02:01.979> no

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
mean you know pretty basic but I had no

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
mean you know pretty basic but I had no
idea<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.850> judging<00:02:03.210> by<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> picture

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
idea I was just judging by the picture

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.540 
idea I was just judging by the picture
so<00:02:04.860> i<00:02:04.890> chose<00:02:05.369> turnout<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.270> pretty<00:02:06.869> spot<00:02:07.439> on

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
so i chose turnout it's pretty spot on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.850 
so i chose turnout it's pretty spot on
match<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.879> me<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.349> actual

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
match for me so this is what the actual

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.630 
match for me so this is what the actual
foundation<00:02:11.550> looks<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640
