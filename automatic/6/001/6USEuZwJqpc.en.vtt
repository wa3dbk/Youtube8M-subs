 30 million friends was intrigued by a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 strange candidate in the substitute

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.960
 militant of the animal cause in his 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.670
 four years it is via my daughter and leonie 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.670
 furious of her condition here she is the star 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.869
 tireless defender of our friends 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 Gregory went into politics and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 so came to Paris during the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 last parliamentary elections 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.410
 if he was not elected his poster he 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.180
 sharing with leonie to she won all 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.340
 the votes 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.460
 a person from the first day of the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.439
 pose of my poster took my poster 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.799
 in photo and post it on the networks 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.140
 social 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.150
 and after 7 and broadcast all over the net 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 and I made myself known like that and 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.619
 there were some good comments 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 others bad that it was not 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.650
 seriously but me these are my values ​​and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 it's really nice to have passed 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.720
 this message the room could touch a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.420
 person or single is enough as 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.670
 militant of the animal cause 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 I moved often 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 actions against bullfighting against 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.250
 vivisection against fur 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.750
 I realised that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.670
 that unfortunately that does not lead to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.020
 nothing and that's why I 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.140
 got involved in politics in a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.030
 ecologist party defending values 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.260
 who are mine 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.690
 despite a first experience 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 unhappy Gregory is keen to pursue 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 his fight 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.330
 following the notoriety that I could have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 thanks to the 2012 legislative elections 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.660
 I decided to create my own 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.610
 movement for the animal cause and that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.150
 will be the first French political party 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.340
 to defend animals in France and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.080
 do not doubt dakota he is united will be 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.370
 the first to take their card from 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 party even made kisses and very 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.110
 mischievous and fearless 1 she walks 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.020
 everywhere and sneaks everywhere 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.170
 according to there on my shoulder the six men 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.730
 and the woman August and hop need all the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.020
 watch time because it climbs 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.000
 everywhere so it can be on the edge 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.320
 from a window fell sophie them in 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.650
 a little hole and can not get out 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.750
 on average ferrets sleep about 18 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.989
 hours a day so they have a lapse of 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.820
 4 hours of play time it takes you 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.610
 have to play with them care and the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.530
 go outside for not they 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.310
 remain locked up so that they can 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.530
 move and so work out as he gets 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.790
 must 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.650
 when he is not in campaign 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.230
 our candidate take advantage of 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.709
 city ​​with leonie and dakota their game 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 favorite 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.770
 go take a little head in the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.760
 fountain 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.760
 this you 're going to go in the water 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.350
 she's a little scared but that's 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.800
 we feel good and that makes us 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.930
 exercise 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.320
 I think it's still recommended 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.240
 in the heat of spending and seeing the heat 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.630
 who is doing today I think it's him 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.630
 do no harm 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.410
 for Gregory it's never without his furore 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.390
 the rat refusing dogs on his 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.800
 network dakota unfortunately can 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.260
 not be part 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.850
 a fight more to make accept the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.940
 dogs off-peak on the bus 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.940
 Ile 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.659
 how all his friends 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.009
 the lowlands 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.089
 I avoid taking the car and I 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.489
 prefer to take public transport 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:39.979
 with her and people are taken aback 

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:42.619
 we ask a lot of questions that's 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.330
 rare to see an animal a little ferret 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:46.330
 like that in public transportation 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.969
 today he pays a visit to the 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.249
 refuge of saint maur in region 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:05:06.050
 Parisian is where he met 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:08.059
 leonie for the first time before 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.219
 to get to the refuge the ferret has been 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:12.110
 found abandoned in a cafe and 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.709
 it was the honor a friend of Gregory 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.709
 who cared 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:24.740
 we look at the beautiful butterflies of life 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:30.379
 I need here are from the same family 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:34.579
 of their names are kisses too 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.110
 cute I sent a picture of 

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.419
 Veronica was pretty funny enough to 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.749
 Gregory he answered me then two 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.610
 minutes I know I finally want it me 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:44.509
 do it almost wacky but that's it 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.529
 it was love at first sight when he said 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.059
 that he had love at first sight for 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.269
 leonie was not even at first 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.159
 look 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:51.979
 it was the first picture like 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.659
 first approach was was very 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.219
 easy actually she's right now 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.019
 came to me and gave me kisses and 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.719
 that's why I cracked because 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:00.949
 I still had the old a priori of this 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.409
 that they were saying about the Czechs were 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.490
 bitter that it smelled bad then I 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.240
 realized that in the EU everything 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.399
 a ferret who makes a kiss out of 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.619
 rubble as soon as we arrived we would 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.029
 take her in his arms 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:17.539
 so here I said why not and 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:19.119
 I left telling myself that I was going 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.039
 adopt 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:23.659
 a perfectly successful adoption is 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.039
 sure that with Gregory everything is 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.039
 politically furtive
