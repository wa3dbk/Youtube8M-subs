 corner the skin that you want to prefer 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.750
 and we will start in this middle application 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.359
 that you can download the jailbreak 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.570

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.640

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.350
 what is there and good - here against mine 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.640
 here it is and what they are going to do was 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.610
 the comrades are going to lower it will come out 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.809
 in mine I have been the image they give 6 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 and below it says images and assumes that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.339

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:11.080
 live that they also get it for free 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 with the jailbreak we go to applications 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.210
 they are going to look for vanilla where it is mine and 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.910

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.580
 yesterday to document images and going to 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.400
 appear here that is here that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.360
 They need to have the name converted to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.390
 char so they can 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.120
 work because if it does not work what 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
 what it has to be is from 7 to 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.340
 forward erase all or the number that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.190

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.149
 I forgot that as here we erase everything 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.590

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:05.740
 how to save here we put char small and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.120
 create it here so let's wait for a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.669
 little bit although what creates the ground 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.849

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.610
 here we are going to break the wooden ones for 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.600
 how it works does not create anything for the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.480
 style how can you see it works 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.830
