00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
really hard to do on a UTV so this tire

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.039 
really hard to do on a UTV so this tire
was<00:03:22.310> built<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:22.940> racing<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.630> break<00:03:23.840> loose

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049

package now the other thing that the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.720 
package now the other thing that the
wheel<00:04:20.020> offers<00:04:20.410> is<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:21.100> has<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.280> rolled

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
wheel offers is that it has a rolled

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.440 
wheel offers is that it has a rolled
edge<00:04:21.910> front<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.020> back<00:04:23.560> side<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.760> allows

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
edge front and back side so that allows

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.630 
edge front and back side so that allows
for<00:04:25.660> certain<00:04:25.930> strength<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:27.220> heavier<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
for certain strength the heavier the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.330 
for certain strength the heavier the
vehicle<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> better<00:04:28.990> chance<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.470> hitting

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
vehicle is a better chance of hitting

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.130 
vehicle is a better chance of hitting
something<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.940> bending<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.330> via<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.930> wheel

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
something of bending the via the wheel

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.190 
something of bending the via the wheel
so<00:04:33.100> by<00:04:33.760> rolling<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> edge<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.510> protect<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
so by rolling the edge we protect the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.260 
so by rolling the edge we protect the
wheel<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.650> make<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.490> more<00:04:36.910> complete

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
wheel and make it a more complete

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.080 
wheel and make it a more complete
