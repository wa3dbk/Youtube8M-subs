building<00:01:03.550> codes<00:01:04.140> after<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.289> you<00:01:05.920> frame<00:01:06.190> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
building codes after that you frame the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.240 
building codes after that you frame the
floor<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.240> sheeted<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.830> start<00:01:09.100> on<00:01:09.190> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.680 
floor and sheeted then you start on the
walls<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:12.729> explain<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.240> moment<00:01:13.509> why<00:01:13.630> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
walls I'll explain in a moment why the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.699 
walls I'll explain in a moment why the
back<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.530> front<00:01:14.979> walls<00:01:15.250> are<00:01:15.940> only<00:01:16.179> partially

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:16.709 
back and front walls are only partially

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
back and front walls are only partially
cheese<00:01:17.709> and<00:01:18.160> such<00:01:18.429> a<00:01:18.459> haphazard<00:01:19.360> looking<00:01:19.990> way

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
cheese and such a haphazard looking way

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600 
cheese and such a haphazard looking way
then<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:21.850> frame<00:01:22.060> loft<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.830> could<00:01:24.039> do<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.340> full

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
then you frame loft you could do a full

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.020 
then you frame loft you could do a full
loft<00:01:24.880> I've<00:01:25.390> got<00:01:25.660> a<00:01:25.690> half<00:01:25.899> block<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.440> add<00:01:26.590> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
loft I've got a half block here add a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.850 
loft I've got a half block here add a
sill<00:01:28.030> plate<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.539> can<00:01:28.840> build<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.500> roof<00:01:29.709> on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
sill plate so you can build your roof on

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.480 
sill plate so you can build your roof on
top<00:01:30.069> of<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:32.530> are<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.800> gables<00:01:33.160> going

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
top of that these are the gables going

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.279 
top of that these are the gables going
in<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.880> now<00:01:34.479> you'll<00:01:34.660> see<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.959> rest<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
in and now you'll see the rest of the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.130 
in and now you'll see the rest of the
puzzle<00:01:35.590> pieces<00:01:35.770> go<00:01:36.069> in<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:40.539> plywood's<00:01:40.959> cut

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
puzzle pieces go in the plywood's cut

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.130 
puzzle pieces go in the plywood's cut
that<00:01:41.289> way<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:42.750> maximize<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:45.209> the<00:01:46.209> four<00:01:47.020> by

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
that way to maximize the the four by

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.139 
that way to maximize the the four by
eight<00:01:47.170> sheets<00:01:47.590> then<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.670> frame<00:01:48.849> the<00:01:48.970> roof

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
eight sheets then you frame the roof

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:56.570 
eight sheets then you frame the roof
achieve<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:50.069> put<00:01:51.069> on<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.220> porches

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.840 

you<00:01:56.640> roof<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.970> house<00:01:57.150> in<00:01:57.660> case<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> rains<00:01:58.850> but

step you're on for instance this is the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.990 
step you're on for instance this is the
the<00:03:47.640> back<00:03:48.480> wall<00:03:48.750> here's<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.860> right<00:03:50.100> wall<00:03:50.310> so

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the back wall here's the right wall so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
the back wall here's the right wall so
you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.239> see<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:51.980> there's<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you can see it going in here there's the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.130 
you can see it going in here there's the
front<00:03:53.310> wall<00:03:53.550> etc<00:03:55.880> I've<00:03:56.880> also<00:03:57.090> taken<00:03:57.600> advantage

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
front wall etc I've also taken advantage

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.180 
front wall etc I've also taken advantage
of<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.320> fact<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.739> was<00:03:58.890> drawn<00:03:59.070> in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190

illustration I just showed you in the
video<00:04:16.430> walkthrough<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.640> this<00:04:18.329> strange

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
video walkthrough there this strange

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.099 
video walkthrough there this strange
puzzle<00:04:19.019> piece<00:04:20.000> thing<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.269> going<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.750> with

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
puzzle piece thing that's going on with

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.670 
puzzle piece thing that's going on with
the<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:23.340> plywood<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.990> then<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.350> starts<00:04:25.590> to

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the the plywood but then it starts to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.140 
the the plywood but then it starts to
make<00:04:25.770> sense<00:04:25.919> when<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.370> realize<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.970> oh<00:04:27.000> I

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
make sense when you realize that oh I

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.420 
make sense when you realize that oh I
see<00:04:27.479> there<00:04:27.660> are<00:04:27.870> lots<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.440> eight-foot<00:04:28.950> pieces

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
see there are lots of eight-foot pieces

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.219 
see there are lots of eight-foot pieces
being<00:04:29.729> used<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.570> reason<00:04:30.750> some<00:04:31.140> of

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
being used here and the reason some of

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.830 
being used here and the reason some of
them<00:04:31.380> are<00:04:31.500> cut<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:32.100> really<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.580> optimize<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
them are cut is really to optimize the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.880 
them are cut is really to optimize the
plywood<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.530> yet<00:04:35.250> still<00:04:35.550> stagger<00:04:35.910> seams

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
plywood and yet still stagger seams

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.100 
plywood and yet still stagger seams
making<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:38.160> stronger<00:04:41.060> here's<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.330> front

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
making it stronger here's the front

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.760 
making it stronger here's the front
gable<00:04:48.530> also<00:04:49.530> show<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.950> here's<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.910> box<00:04:51.150> Steve

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
gable also show the here's the box Steve

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.240 
gable also show the here's the box Steve
that's<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.130> side<00:04:53.370> here<00:04:53.940> it's<00:04:54.390> boxed<00:04:55.250> meaning

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
that's the side here it's boxed meaning

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.840 
that's the side here it's boxed meaning
it's<00:04:56.400> closed<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.330> some<00:04:57.510> plywood<00:04:58.850> and

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
it's closed in with some plywood and

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.110 
it's closed in with some plywood and
other<00:05:00.000> materials<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.110> here's<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:02.060> sample<00:05:03.060> of
