daisy<00:00:10.740> chain<00:00:11.660> what<00:00:12.660> we've<00:00:12.780> got<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.170> today<00:00:13.349> is

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
daisy chain what we've got here today is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.070 
daisy chain what we've got here today is
a<00:00:13.679> flaked<00:00:14.340> rope<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> show<00:00:15.660> and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
a flaked rope that I'm going to show and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.310 
a flaked rope that I'm going to show and
demonstrate<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.320> 30-meter

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

climbing<00:00:19.920> rope<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:21.090> think<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.740> 120

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

climbing rope I think it's a 120
millimeters<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.400> diameter<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> anyway<00:00:25.980> I'm

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
millimeters in diameter but anyway I'm

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.920 
millimeters in diameter but anyway I'm
going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> show<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.430> easy<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
going to show how easy it is to use a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
going to show how easy it is to use a
chain<00:00:28.260> Senate<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.890> easily<00:00:29.580> manage<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> rope

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

and<00:00:31.279> at<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> same<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:32.989> shorten<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.050> up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and at the same time shorten it up

instructions on ideas tackle if you'd

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.110 
instructions on ideas tackle if you'd
like<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:02.120> today

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
like to take a look at that but today

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.100 
like to take a look at that but today
we're<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> chain

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we're going to be going over the chain

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
we're going to be going over the chain
senate<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.559> i've<00:01:04.860> said<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
senate as i've said so what we want to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
senate as i've said so what we want to
do<00:01:06.630> first<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.140> find<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.220> midpoint<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.820> our

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
do first is find the midpoint of our

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
do first is find the midpoint of our
rope<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:10.020> I've<00:01:10.170> already<00:01:10.290> done<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.979> I'm

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
rope which I've already done here so I'm

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.210 
rope which I've already done here so I'm
going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> lay<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> flake<00:01:11.760> back<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:13.220> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
going to lay this flake back down and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to lay this flake back down and
once<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.939> found<00:01:15.119> our<00:01:15.270> midpoint<00:01:16.100> what<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.189> want

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
once we found our midpoint what we want

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.539 
once we found our midpoint what we want
to<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:18.140> simply<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> loop<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:23.600> pull

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
to do simply make a loop and then pull

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.680 
to do simply make a loop and then pull
through<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> loop<00:01:28.280> let<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> again

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.180 

make<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.720> loop<00:01:39.640> just<00:01:40.640> like<00:01:40.760> so<00:01:41.950> pull<00:01:42.950> through

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
make a loop just like so pull through

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:53.140 
make a loop just like so pull through
the<00:01:43.310> loop<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.980> tighten<00:01:51.790> once<00:01:52.790> we<00:01:52.940> have<00:01:53.120> that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
the loop and tighten once we have that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.420 
the loop and tighten once we have that
loop<00:01:56.530> make<00:01:57.530> sure<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:57.860> good<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.040> tight

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980 

we're<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.610> take<00:02:01.790> our<00:02:01.970> working<00:02:02.390> end<00:02:02.600> or

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
we're going to take our working end or

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.510 
we're going to take our working end or
what's<00:02:03.200> effectively<00:02:03.710> become<00:02:03.980> our<00:02:04.100> working<00:02:04.310> in

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
what's effectively become our working in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.850 
what's effectively become our working in
and<00:02:04.760> reach<00:02:05.660> through<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.229> loop<00:02:06.380> we've<00:02:06.650> made

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
and reach through that loop we've made

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430 
and reach through that loop we've made
this<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.729> kind<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.600> loop<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.020> hang<00:02:09.229> from

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
this is kind of a loop you can hang from

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.800 
this is kind of a loop you can hang from
if<00:02:09.679> you're<00:02:09.800> gonna<00:02:10.150> hang<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> rope<00:02:11.450> up<00:02:11.630> that

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
if you're gonna hang the rope up that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.730 
if you're gonna hang the rope up that
you<00:02:11.900> shorten<00:02:12.580> reach<00:02:13.580> through<00:02:13.940> grab<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.590> let

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
you shorten reach through grab and let

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.300 
you shorten reach through grab and let
the<00:02:15.860> weight<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> rope<00:02:16.430> carry<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.300> down<00:02:18.310> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the weight of the rope carry it down so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.880 
the weight of the rope carry it down so
as<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.090> keep<00:02:20.270> doing<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:21.530> weight<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
as you keep doing this the weight of the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.010 
as you keep doing this the weight of the
rope<00:02:22.040> will<00:02:22.220> get<00:02:22.340> heavier<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.900> have

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
rope will get heavier and all you have

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.120 
rope will get heavier and all you have
to<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.650> keep<00:02:24.800> feeding<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.310> through

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
to do is just keep feeding it through

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.830 
to do is just keep feeding it through
very<00:02:28.130> quickly<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.959> take<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> 90-foot<00:02:30.650> rope

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
very quickly you can take a 90-foot rope

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.229 
very quickly you can take a 90-foot rope
shorten<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.760> make<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.880> easily<00:02:35.330> manageable<00:02:37.239> so

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
shorten it make it easily manageable so

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.110 
shorten it make it easily manageable so
once<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> end<00:02:39.730> then<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:40.940> one

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
once you get to the end then with one

once you get to the end then with one
more<00:02:41.239> loop<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:42.010> want<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.070> leave<00:02:43.160> yourself

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
more loop here want to leave yourself

more loop here want to leave yourself
plenty<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.880> slack<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.260> you're<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.590> going<00:02:45.709> to

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
plenty of slack and you're just going to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
plenty of slack and you're just going to
tie<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> simple<00:02:46.340> overhand<00:02:46.550> knot<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.739> so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
tie a simple overhand knot just like so

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.410 
tie a simple overhand knot just like so
now<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.959> you've<00:02:51.140> got<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.940> nice<00:02:53.090> chain

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
now what you've got it's a nice chain

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.199 
now what you've got it's a nice chain
Sennett<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:55.130> can<00:02:55.280> store<00:02:55.519> whatever<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.030> like

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
Sennett you can store whatever you like

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.140 
Sennett you can store whatever you like
and<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.769> going<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.130> come<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:58.970> not

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and it's not going to come or it's not

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.310 
and it's not going to come or it's not
going<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.330> tangle<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.870> and<00:02:59.989> allow<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.200> to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
going to tangle on you and allow it to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.770 
going to tangle on you and allow it to
come<00:03:00.980> undone<00:03:01.280> very<00:03:01.519> easily<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.600> way<00:03:02.720> you

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
come undone very easily and the way you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.440 
come undone very easily and the way you
do<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:04.100> by<00:03:04.400> grabbing<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.940> working<00:03:05.300> end

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
do that is by grabbing that working end

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.699 
do that is by grabbing that working end
again<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.230> tied<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.620> an

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
again that you just tied with an

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.190 
again that you just tied with an
overhand<00:03:07.040> knot<00:03:08.410> undoing<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:11.989> so

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
overhand knot undoing that just like so

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
overhand knot undoing that just like so
and<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:13.790> dropping<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:15.430> come<00:03:16.430> out<00:03:16.550> very

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
and just dropping it come out very

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.500 
and just dropping it come out very
easily

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.840 

and<00:03:22.510> get<00:03:22.660> right<00:03:22.810> back<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.080> your<00:03:23.350> mid<00:03:23.560> point

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and get right back to your mid point

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.880 
and get right back to your mid point
that<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.970> initially<00:03:25.180> tied<00:03:25.570> once<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.650> get<00:03:26.770> to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
that you initially tied once you get to

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.810 
that you initially tied once you get to
this<00:03:27.010> part<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.130> matter<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.400> slipping

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
this part it's just a matter of slipping

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.380 
this part it's just a matter of slipping
it<00:03:31.060> out

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
it out

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.030 
it out
and<00:03:32.080> coming<00:03:32.350> right<00:03:32.470> back<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.800> your<00:03:32.860> midpoint

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
and coming right back to your midpoint

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.390 
and coming right back to your midpoint
again<00:03:33.900> lots<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.020> people<00:03:35.290> use<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.740> chain

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
again lots of people use this chain
