I might see what the Jaguars wanted to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.120 
I might see what the Jaguars wanted to
have<00:03:34.610> one<00:03:34.790> team<00:03:35.060> if<00:03:35.810> either<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.320> colts<00:03:36.800> or<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
Jaguars want to randomize it then it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.090 
Jaguars want to randomize it then it
gets<00:03:38.660> randomized<00:03:39.140> if<00:03:39.290> they<00:03:39.410> both<00:03:39.620> agree<00:03:39.950> they

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
gets randomized if they both agree they

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.460 
gets randomized if they both agree they
want<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.430> something<00:03:40.640> else<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.200> guess<00:03:42.200> we<00:03:42.350> can

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
want to do something else I guess we can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.420 
want to do something else I guess we can
