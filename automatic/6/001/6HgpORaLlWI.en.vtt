00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
but it's obviously stood some reaction

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.610 
but it's obviously stood some reaction
from<00:03:15.489> her<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.540> being<00:03:16.720> worried<00:03:17.110> about<00:03:17.200> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620

history here shows me that she's had to
take<00:03:19.780> care<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.290> responsibility<00:03:20.860> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
take care of that responsibility and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.979 
take care of that responsibility and
