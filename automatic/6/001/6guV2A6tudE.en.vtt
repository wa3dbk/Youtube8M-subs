00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.590
 Hello everyone and I'm still happy 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.530
 we are here in gta for a long time 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.119
 I did not get in and as you know yesterday in the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.190
 yesterday's video I said that in these next 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 days I was going to get things out of gta 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:31.080
 for the new dlc the theme is already you know 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 if you do not know it then I say what 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.790
 it has leaked that the jetpack will come out 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 how much they craved so much we wanted 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.190
 came out again as the jetpack the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.519
 jetpack will then go out again 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.070
 is going to come out and we say why 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.769
 can serve the jetpack apart from good 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 we start to fly and all handsome 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.360
 he does the crazy as the salao always does 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.699
 Well, the jetpack will serve for 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.229
 part we do not know if we can complete it 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.780
 I think we can not complete it 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.020
 still but it will serve to continue 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.270
 making that interest that there was that 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.800
 hidden interest that there was of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.259
 aliens and because I know it look 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.140
 look what I saw below I do not even 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.539
 I remembered this but look where is 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.440
 is here the jetpack which wants 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.600
 say that these are the steps to follow 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.210
 of ribbons that remained us 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.729
 we were in that good that we saw we saw the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.159
 ship flying at night at one of the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 tomorrow the secret ones raining with 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.130
 thunder as we said no but now 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.929
 clear simply because we saw the ships 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 it's like that, flying and that 's it and we have very 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.550
 as saying good everything for this god 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.789
 go fuck no, well, I think it's that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.129
 this during the following of leces 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.759
 little by little we are going to have to go 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:04.840
 resolving in part by parts up 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.390
 that we can discover this and three this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.069
 total interest not that the same does not 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.440
 same the best then now with the jetpack 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.319
 it turns out that we can guess what I touch 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.480
 for example what the egg is 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.550
 go and in between we do not know yet 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 what will be the egg that supposedly 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.840
 It will be a baby boy nn 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 but we do not know what it will be 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.810
 then there is this mini ship here or this 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.209
 ship that we also do not know what though 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.670
 in one of the missions you already know that there 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.310
 a mission that there is a tiny craft 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.349
 that you have to go by forming 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.620
 pieces and that but the ship then goes 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.830
 flying then 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.580
 I do not think that 's part of dellys 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.819
 3gs because they are a simple mission but if 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.909
 they give us the jetpack and notice there is a 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.930
 union directly from the jet paq with the 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.700
 ship then the best then directly 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 with the jetpack doing whatever 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.150
 we got the ship and that's it 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.900
 up a little bit I do not know we'll have to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.720
 be pending people I'm already out in 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.250
 very little very little time already this and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.829
 We will have to be aware of this 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.989
 secret stress of the jet paq and the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.700
 aliens and you know everything 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.160
 referring to that you have it here in my 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.660
 channel without like before giving like 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 subscribe and until the next video
