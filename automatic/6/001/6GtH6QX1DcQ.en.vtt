00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.610
 the implant 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.619
 the loss of a tooth generates 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 alterations in the mouth that will be 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 the greater the number of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.430
 lost pieces and the elapsed time 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.890
 until its replacement 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.870
 in the absence of tooth food 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 will damage the free gum during 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.650
 intake making it difficult to chew and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.650
 producing irritations 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.070
 next the adjacent teeth and 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.589
 opposites will try to occupy the space 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.579
 empty and they will be inclining little by little 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.680
 until you find the lost contact that 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.570
 will make the interdental points 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.129
 open up, hindering hygiene and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.649
 facilitating the retention of food 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.829
 between the teeth which will increase the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.579
 occurrence of caries and the formation of 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.770
 tartar 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 in addition the packaged food also 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.110
 will favor the appearance of the disease 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.110
 periodontal 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 and over time as the opposite tooth 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.760
 will try to find its opposite this one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.010
 will be losing anchorage little by little 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.470
 [Music] 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.470
 there will be mobility and you can even get lost 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.390
 and finally the change of position of 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.729
 the teeth so that they are articulated 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.009
 incorrectly appearing contacts 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.060
 undue and overloads that will produce 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.060
 wear and pain 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.010
 the most innovative solution to these 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.880
 problems involves the placement of 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.880
 dental implants 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.079
 an implant is an artificial root 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.969
 fully compatible with your body that 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.770
 will be strongly integrated with the bone 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.810
 that surrounds it fulfilling the same 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.810
 functions that natural roots 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.280
 this artificial root will receive in its 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 end a crown

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:25.090
 a bridge or a removable prosthesis that 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.430
 thanks to the implants it will be fixed 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.370
 solidly and will not move from the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.530
 in certain cases if there is a lack of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.810
 bone your dentist will replenish first the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.650
 lost bone to receive the implant 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.650
 sure way 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.130
 ah 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.260
 undoubtedly the implant is the best option 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.360
 in the struggle for comfort and
