it's the perfect Orchestra for me I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.089

think

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.280 

the<00:02:10.969> thing<00:02:11.150> about<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.540> accordions<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.200> you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the thing about the accordions that you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.809 
the thing about the accordions that you
move<00:02:12.439> a<00:02:12.590> lot<00:02:12.769> it's<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.010> very<00:02:13.189> movable

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
move a lot it's a very movable

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.610 
move a lot it's a very movable
instrument<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.659> turn<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> little<00:02:15.349> when<00:02:15.530> you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
instrument it turn a little when you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.160 
instrument it turn a little when you
phrase<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.489> not<00:02:16.670> used<00:02:16.879> really<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.480> using

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
phrase and I'm not used really to using

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.080 
phrase and I'm not used really to using
microphones<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:18.920> all<00:02:19.069> for<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.939> sound

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
microphones at all for the the sound

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.240 
microphones at all for the the sound
changes<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:21.109> this<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.439> you<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.769> sort<00:02:22.159> of<00:02:22.189> just

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
changes in this way you can sort of just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.270 
changes in this way you can sort of just
attach<00:02:22.879> it<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.239> don't<00:02:23.810> worry<00:02:24.079> about<00:02:24.280> where

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
attach it and don't worry about where

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.670 
attach it and don't worry about where
you're<00:02:25.430> moving<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.329> I<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
you're moving this is I think the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.069 
you're moving this is I think the
optimal<00:02:28.099> way<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:28.939> do<00:02:29.180> it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.750
