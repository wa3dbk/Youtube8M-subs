time right now I figured this is the

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.539 
time right now I figured this is the
perfect<00:00:04.380> chance<00:00:04.799> for<00:00:04.920> me<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.310> review

Christmas<00:00:06.089> nights<00:00:06.420> into<00:00:06.660> dreams<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.950> Sega

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
Christmas nights into dreams on the Sega

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.490 
Christmas nights into dreams on the Sega
Saturn<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.690> Japanese<00:00:10.110> version

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
Saturn and this is the Japanese version

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.709 
Saturn and this is the Japanese version
that<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.710> am<00:00:10.800> playing<00:00:11.010> mainly<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that I am playing mainly because it's a

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.450 
that I am playing mainly because it's a
lot<00:00:12.929> easier<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.349> cheaper<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.040> ahold<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
lot easier and cheaper to get ahold of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.180 
lot easier and cheaper to get ahold of
than<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.330> US<00:00:15.570> version<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:17.039> only

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
than the US version of it the only

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.920 
than the US version of it the only
difference<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.210> opening<00:00:18.720> cinematic

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
difference is that the opening cinematic

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140 
difference is that the opening cinematic
is<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.710> Japanese<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.369> other<00:00:20.550> than<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.789> all

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is in Japanese but other than that all

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
is in Japanese but other than that all
the<00:00:21.270> menus<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> text<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> game<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.369> nice

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the menus the text in the game is nice

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.509 
the menus the text in the game is nice
and<00:00:23.820> easy<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.119> read<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> English<00:00:25.519> this

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
lot of fun it does require quite a bit

lot of fun it does require quite a bit
of<00:01:39.860> memorization<00:01:40.310> if<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.940> want<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.330> for

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
of memorization if you want to go for

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.230 
of memorization if you want to go for
some<00:01:41.660> high<00:01:41.840> scores<00:01:42.200> because<00:01:42.950> things<00:01:43.850> tend<00:01:43.940> to

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
some high scores because things tend to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.150 
some high scores because things tend to
go<00:01:44.390> pretty<00:01:44.600> fast<00:01:44.869> at<00:01:45.200> times<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:45.770> hard<00:01:46.010> to

go pretty fast at times and it's hard to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.520 
go pretty fast at times and it's hard to
remember<00:01:46.450> where<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.630> loops<00:01:47.840> turn<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.380> where

remember where the loops turn to where

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.190 
remember where the loops turn to where
the<00:01:48.680> items<00:01:48.979> are<00:01:49.160> exactly<00:01:49.550> enormous<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.930> as<00:01:51.080> I
