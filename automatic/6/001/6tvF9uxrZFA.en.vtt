bit<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.220> word<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.610> advice<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:41.420> thing<00:02:41.629> that

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
bit just a word of advice one thing that

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.140 
bit just a word of advice one thing that
I<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:42.140> noticed<00:02:42.650> right<00:02:42.890> off<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
I have noticed right off of that is it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.660 
I have noticed right off of that is it
seems<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.720> take<00:02:48.560> just<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.010> little<00:02:49.040> bit<00:02:49.430> longer

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
seems to take just a little bit longer

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.809 
seems to take just a little bit longer
cooking<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.989> way<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:52.129> it<00:02:52.370> seems<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.700> be

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
cooking this way but it seems to be

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.390 
cooking this way but it seems to be
working<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.180> fine<00:02:55.599> so<00:02:56.599> whenever<00:02:57.400> whatever

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
working just fine so whenever whatever

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.900 
working just fine so whenever whatever
you<00:02:58.910> know<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.329> can<00:02:59.870> turn<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.140> heat<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.910> you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you know you can turn the heat up you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.449 
you know you can turn the heat up you
know<00:03:02.030> real<00:03:02.299> easy<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> stove<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.190> is

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
know real easy on the stove but this is

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.420 
know real easy on the stove but this is
kind<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.970> slow<00:03:05.180> even<00:03:05.450> heat<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:07.010> might

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
kind of a slow even heat so it might

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.170 
kind of a slow even heat so it might
take<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.599> little<00:03:08.629> bit<00:03:08.870> longer<00:03:09.109> but<00:03:09.730> hey<00:03:10.730> as

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
take just a little bit longer but hey as

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.940 
take just a little bit longer but hey as
long<00:03:11.239> as<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.629> gets<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.930> job<00:03:11.959> done<00:03:12.140> that's<00:03:12.680> what

long as it gets the job done that's what

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.270 
long as it gets the job done that's what
matters<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.430> an<00:03:14.180> emergency<00:03:14.359> situation<00:03:15.250> now<00:03:16.250> i
