through<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:06.070> found<00:01:06.310> with<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.640> pace<00:01:07.380> even

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
through and I found with that pace even

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.840 
through and I found with that pace even
aside<00:01:08.830> from<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.009> amp<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.310> was<00:01:09.430> made<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.729> was

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
aside from the amp I was made I was

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.580 
aside from the amp I was made I was
using<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.660> bass<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.200> actually<00:01:11.470> had

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
using it was the bass that actually had

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.410 
using it was the bass that actually had
the<00:01:11.710> cutting<00:01:12.070> edge<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.610> need<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.880> was<00:01:13.119> so

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
the cutting edge that I need it was so

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:35.020 
the cutting edge that I need it was so
so<00:01:14.140> comfortable<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.070> play

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.290 

it<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.930> vibe<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:38.160> was<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.970> call<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
it just had a vibe it was like I call it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.640 
it just had a vibe it was like I call it
a<00:01:39.360> butter<00:01:39.630> neck<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.910> it<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.230> made

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
a butter neck and it just it just made

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.650 
a butter neck and it just it just made
it<00:01:43.770> easy<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.190> do<00:01:44.430> stupid<00:01:44.700> things<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.180> base<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
it easy to do stupid things on base it

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.420 
it easy to do stupid things on base it
really<00:01:45.960> did<00:01:46.230> made<00:01:46.440> it<00:01:46.560> easy<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.860> found<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
really did made it easy I found it I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.970 
really did made it easy I found it I
could<00:01:47.790> probably<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.330> if<00:01:48.510> I<00:01:48.600> tried<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.980> but

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
could probably do this if I tried it but

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.330 
could probably do this if I tried it but
like<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.940> neck<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.390> had<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:52.290> unlike<00:01:52.650> any

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
like this neck I had was unlike any

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
like this neck I had was unlike any
other<00:01:53.550> neck<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.480> I<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.570> his<00:01:54.900> base<00:01:55.080> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
other neck and it so I put his base in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
other neck and it so I put his base in
storage<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.980> just<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.280> forward<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.120> put

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
storage and just to forward this I put

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
storage and just to forward this I put
it<00:01:57.690> in<00:01:57.780> storage<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.470> know<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.800> been<00:01:58.980> in

the less expensive of the bases but this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.930 
the less expensive of the bases but this
is<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> quality<00:02:25.920> base<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.310> I've<00:02:26.459> used<00:02:26.700> this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
is a quality base like I've used this

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.390 

friend<00:03:24.000> Jose<00:03:24.330> turn<00:03:24.630> me<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:25.170> ASP<00:03:25.620> turn<00:03:26.070> me<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.220> to

these<00:03:26.490> EMG<00:03:26.910> X's<00:03:27.240> which<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.500> more<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
these EMG X's which are more like a

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.010 
these EMG X's which are more like a
passive<00:03:29.670> pick<00:03:30.240> up<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.780> know<00:03:30.870> they're

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
passive pick up there you know they're

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.690 
passive pick up there you know they're
active<00:03:31.290> pickups<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:32.010> they<00:03:32.130> sound<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.520> like

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
active pickups but they sound more like

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.340 
active pickups but they sound more like
a<00:03:32.880> passive<00:03:33.240> which<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.480> kind<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.140> that

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
a passive which I kind of like so that

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.410 
a passive which I kind of like so that
could<00:03:34.500> good<00:03:34.770> mix<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.340> between<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.330> this

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
could good mix in between so for this

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.330 
could good mix in between so for this
music<00:03:36.750> cuts<00:03:37.050> right<00:03:37.230> between<00:03:37.440> that's<00:03:38.130> why<00:03:38.310> I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
music cuts right between that's why I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.250 
music cuts right between that's why I
think<00:03:38.520> these<00:03:39.060> basses<00:03:39.600> men<00:03:39.750> are<00:03:39.990> going<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.170> make

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
think these basses men are going to make

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.900 
think these basses men are going to make
a<00:03:40.290> big<00:03:40.740> difference<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.280> people<00:03:41.550> try<00:03:41.730> them

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
a big difference when people try them

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.460 
a big difference when people try them
when<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.420> play<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.720> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.020> music<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.410> think

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
when you play this kind of music I think

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.530 
when you play this kind of music I think
it's<00:03:43.620> really<00:03:43.920> really<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.180> cut<00:03:45.510> through

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it's really really the same cut through

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180 
it's really really the same cut through
vibe<00:03:45.960> that<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.800> get<00:03:46.950> through<00:03:47.070> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
vibe that you can get through the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.800 
vibe that you can get through the
guitars<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.330> can<00:03:48.450> get<00:03:48.540> through<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
guitars and you can get through the the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.860 
guitars and you can get through the the
kick<00:03:49.440> drum<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.950> really<00:03:50.430> won't<00:03:50.750> you're<00:03:51.750> not
