Thursday<00:00:02.129> April<00:00:02.250> 24th<00:00:03.830> cutting<00:00:04.830> our<00:00:04.950> initial

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
Thursday April 24th cutting our initial

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.390 
Thursday April 24th cutting our initial
pass<00:00:08.519> into<00:00:09.519> upper<00:00:09.730> quad<00:00:10.000> here<00:00:10.980> took<00:00:11.980> us<00:00:12.100> longer

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
pass into upper quad here took us longer

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.730 
pass into upper quad here took us longer
than<00:00:13.299> we<00:00:13.450> would<00:00:13.870> have<00:00:13.900> liked<00:00:14.139> to<00:00:14.170> get<00:00:14.500> through

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
than we would have liked to get through

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.480 
than we would have liked to get through
those<00:00:14.860> avalanche<00:00:15.490> areas<00:00:18.330> switchback<00:00:19.330> there

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
those avalanche areas switchback there

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.269 
those avalanche areas switchback there
but<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.689> get<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.930> hole<00:00:23.169> cut<00:00:23.470> up<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.770> this<00:00:23.919> point

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
but you get a hole cut up to this point

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:38.069 
but you get a hole cut up to this point
or<00:00:24.610> you<00:00:24.669> can<00:00:24.790> drive<00:00:25.239> it<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.809> where<00:00:37.989> I'm

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
or you can drive it right where I'm

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.220 
or you can drive it right where I'm
sitting<00:00:38.440> I'm<00:00:38.530> almost<00:00:38.980> 40<00:00:39.400> feet<00:00:39.430> above<00:00:40.300> road

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
sitting I'm almost 40 feet above road

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.550 
sitting I'm almost 40 feet above road
surface<00:00:41.260> level<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.750> see<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.170> top<00:00:44.380> the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
surface level you just see the top the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.640 
surface level you just see the top the
guardrail<00:00:45.540> poking<00:00:46.540> out<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:46.900> drift<00:00:47.470> there

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
guardrail poking out of the drift there

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.940 
guardrail poking out of the drift there
just<00:00:47.890> below<00:00:48.130> me

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.310 

once<00:00:52.489> he<00:00:52.640> gets<00:00:52.880> below<00:00:53.450> me<00:00:53.690> he's<00:00:53.930> got<00:00:54.110> to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
once he gets below me he's got to

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.090 
once he gets below me he's got to
navigate<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.930> blowhole<00:00:56.930> there<00:00:57.290> hits<00:00:57.860> the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
navigate that blowhole there hits the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.689 
navigate that blowhole there hits the
rocks<00:00:59.739> center<00:01:00.739> line<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.129> road<00:01:01.340> is

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
rocks center line of the road is

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.380 
rocks center line of the road is
probably<00:01:02.360> right<00:01:03.460> straight<00:01:04.460> below<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.119> peak

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
probably right straight below and peak

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.710 
probably right straight below and peak
and<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:06.100> drift<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.970> then<00:01:11.090> off<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.630> left

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
and that drift and then off to the left

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.649 
and that drift and then off to the left
of<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.979> slopes<00:01:13.400> over<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.850> rail<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.450> it's

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
of that it slopes over the rail so it's

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:27.670 
of that it slopes over the rail so it's
very<00:01:15.020> tricky<00:01:25.990> probably<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.200> take<00:01:27.350> him<00:01:27.560> a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
very tricky probably going to take him a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.910 
very tricky probably going to take him a
couple<00:01:27.710> days<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.490> get<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.880> knocked<00:01:29.149> out

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
couple days to get this knocked out

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.560 
couple days to get this knocked out
where<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.100> can<00:01:31.190> start<00:01:31.460> trying<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.240> punch

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
where we can start trying to punch

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.800 
where we can start trying to punch
through<00:01:32.899> with<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.320> motor<00:01:33.710> Patrol

Matt<00:01:40.470> corner<00:01:40.950> where<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.340> loader<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.909> parked

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.719 

over<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> creek<00:01:47.659> crossing<00:01:48.319> there<00:01:48.609> as<00:01:49.609> you

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
over to the creek crossing there as you

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.370 
over to the creek crossing there as you
see<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.030> roads<00:01:50.240> starting<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.689> bend<00:01:50.929> back<00:01:51.109> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
see the roads starting to bend back to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
see the roads starting to bend back to
the<00:01:51.499> left

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.510 

that<00:01:54.930> stretch<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.560> probably<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:58.369> 1,500<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that stretch is probably a good 1,500 to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
that stretch is probably a good 1,500 to
2,000<00:02:00.210> feet

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.560 

and<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.080> peeked<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.860> drifts

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
and it's all like this peeked up drifts

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.930 
and it's all like this peeked up drifts
oddly-shaped<00:02:09.570> against<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.410> rocks<00:02:10.760> closer<00:02:11.760> to

oddly-shaped against the rocks closer to
the<00:02:12.060> rail<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.480> spots<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:17.030> got<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.180> real

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the rail and spots just got to be real

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.490 
the rail and spots just got to be real
patient<00:02:18.600> through<00:02:19.020> here<00:02:19.260> knocking<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.220> out
