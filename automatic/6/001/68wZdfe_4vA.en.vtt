place<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.790> lay<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.170> cover

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
place and you lay down and they cover

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.690 
place and you lay down and they cover
you<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> blanket<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.490> relaxing

you with a blanket it's really relaxing

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
you with a blanket it's really relaxing
and<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.909> cotton<00:01:47.909> pads<00:01:48.689> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and they put little cotton pads right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
and they put little cotton pads right
under<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.399> actually<00:01:50.670> put<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.000> little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
under they actually put them a little

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.999 
under they actually put them a little
bit<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.570> eye<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> bottom<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.920> then

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
bit in your eye on the bottom and then

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
bit in your eye on the bottom and then
you<00:01:53.040> close<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.729> eye<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.170> sure

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you close your eye just to make sure

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.300 
you close your eye just to make sure
they<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.710> anything<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.189> eye

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
they don't get anything in your eye

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
they don't get anything in your eye
while<00:01:56.670> they're<00:01:56.850> doing<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> then

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
while they're doing it and then

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.709 
while they're doing it and then
basically<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.130> lay<00:01:59.610> back<00:01:59.640> relax<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.570> lot

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
basically you just lay back relax a lot

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.910 
basically you just lay back relax a lot
of<00:02:00.810> people<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.110> fall<00:02:01.409> asleep<00:02:01.740> while

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of people actually fall asleep while

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160 
of people actually fall asleep while
they're<00:02:02.100> having<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.549> done<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.990> it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they're having them done because it's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
they're having them done because it's
you<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.829> takes<00:02:05.399> quite<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> while<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.090> took

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you just takes quite a while it took

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.090 
you just takes quite a while it took
about<00:02:06.540> an<00:02:06.780> hour<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.170> half<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.009> got<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.489> set

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
about an hour and a half and I got a set

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.610 
about an hour and a half and I got a set
that<00:02:09.700> was<00:02:09.820> up<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.180> 90<00:02:10.570> lashes<00:02:10.990> applied<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.410> each

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that was up to 90 lashes applied to each

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.280 
that was up to 90 lashes applied to each
eye<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.550> what<00:02:12.850> they<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.390> they<00:02:13.510> individually

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
eye so what they do is they individually

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.790 
eye so what they do is they individually
apply<00:02:14.560> them<00:02:14.800> using<00:02:15.400> tweezers<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:17.230> bond<00:02:17.560> them

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
apply them using tweezers they bond them

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.880 
apply them using tweezers they bond them
to<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.160> natural<00:02:18.880> lashes<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.590> takes<00:02:20.800> a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
to your natural lashes so it takes a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 
to your natural lashes so it takes a
long<00:02:21.070> time<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.700> them<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:22.170> individually<00:02:23.170> apply

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
long time for them to individually apply

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.170 
long time for them to individually apply
each<00:02:23.740> lash<00:02:24.610> um<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:27.130> should<00:02:27.970> have

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
each lash um and I should have

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
each lash um and I should have
researched<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.810> little<00:02:29.020> bit<00:02:29.110> more<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.320> will<00:02:29.560> say

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
researched a little bit more I will say

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.320 
researched a little bit more I will say
and<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.520> I've<00:02:30.610> done<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.120> know<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and now that I've done it I know a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.290 
and now that I've done it I know a
little<00:02:31.510> bit<00:02:31.660> more<00:02:32.190> because<00:02:33.190> there's<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.940> lot<00:02:34.180> of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
little bit more because there's a lot of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.640 
little bit more because there's a lot of
different<00:02:34.570> options<00:02:34.750> when<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
different options when you get there and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.580 
different options when you get there and
I<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.150> was<00:02:37.330> lost<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.380> pick

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
I kind of was lost on what to pick

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.220 
I kind of was lost on what to pick
because<00:02:39.010> they<00:02:39.700> measure<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.810> lashes<00:02:41.200> in

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
because they measure the lashes in

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.780 
because they measure the lashes in
millimeters<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.100> they<00:02:42.190> asked<00:02:42.460> they<00:02:42.550> were<00:02:42.640> like

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
millimeters so they asked they were like

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570 
millimeters so they asked they were like
you<00:02:43.210> know<00:02:43.270> we<00:02:43.390> have<00:02:43.510> from<00:02:43.690> 9<00:02:43.930> size<00:02:44.350> 9<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.860> 15<00:02:45.010> and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
you know we have from 9 size 9 to 15 and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.090 
you know we have from 9 size 9 to 15 and
9<00:02:46.030> millimeters<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.810> 15<00:02:47.140> millimeters<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.860> how

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
9 millimeters to 15 millimeters on how

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
9 millimeters to 15 millimeters on how
much<00:02:48.310> they're<00:02:48.760> going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> apply<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.630> your

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
much they're going to apply to your

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.840 
much they're going to apply to your
individual<00:02:50.770> lashes<00:02:50.950> now<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.370> eyelashes<00:02:51.820> are

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
individual lashes now my eyelashes are

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.770 
individual lashes now my eyelashes are
pretty<00:02:52.180> sure<00:02:52.930> they're<00:02:53.410> pretty<00:02:53.650> straight<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
pretty sure they're pretty straight and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.390 
pretty sure they're pretty straight and
they're<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.560> little<00:02:56.800> bit<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> lighter<00:02:57.250> side

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
they're a little bit on the lighter side

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.370 
they're a little bit on the lighter side
there's<00:02:58.150> certainly<00:02:58.540> not<00:02:58.660> blonde<00:02:58.960> but<00:02:59.230> they're

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
there's certainly not blonde but they're

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.730 
there's certainly not blonde but they're
like<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> light<00:02:59.800> brown<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:01.290> they<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.590> thing

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
like a light brown so they are the thing

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.050 
like a light brown so they are the thing
that<00:03:02.770> takes<00:03:02.980> me<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> longest<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.730> do<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that takes me the longest to do in the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.160 
that takes me the longest to do in the
morning<00:03:04.150> because<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.510> really<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.900> have

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
morning because I really like to have

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.280 
morning because I really like to have
kind<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.740> big<00:03:06.250> bold<00:03:06.580> eye<00:03:06.850> look<00:03:07.300> in<00:03:08.080> general

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
kind of a big bold eye look in general

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.620 
kind of a big bold eye look in general
so<00:03:08.740> anyway<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.850> like<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.120> didn't<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.480> what

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
so anyway it's like I didn't know what

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.430 
so anyway it's like I didn't know what
to<00:03:10.750> pick<00:03:10.960> so<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.710> end<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.920> got<00:03:12.070> um<00:03:12.720> 10<00:03:13.720> 10

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to pick so in the end I got um 10 10

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.560 
to pick so in the end I got um 10 10
millimeters<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.130> inner<00:03:15.390> inside<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.510> my

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
millimeters on the inner inside of my

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.900 
millimeters on the inner inside of my
eyes<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.080> then<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:18.100> middle<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.580> got<00:03:18.760> like

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
eyes and then the middle I got like

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790 
eyes and then the middle I got like
Elevens<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.660> on<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> n12

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
Elevens and on the n12

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.010 
Elevens and on the n12
I<00:03:20.890> think<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.490> next<00:03:21.730> time<00:03:21.820> I'll<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.210> I'll<00:03:22.570> go<00:03:22.990> a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
I think the next time I'll go I'll go a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.160

using a cotton pads to gently remove my
makeup<00:04:57.169> instead<00:04:57.470> of<00:04:57.740> what<00:04:58.159> I<00:04:58.190> usually<00:04:58.370> do

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
makeup instead of what I usually do

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.520 
makeup instead of what I usually do
which<00:04:59.630> actually<00:04:59.960> I<00:04:59.990> think<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.169> much<00:05:00.319> better

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
which actually I think is much better

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.790 
which actually I think is much better
for<00:05:00.830> my<00:05:00.949> for<00:05:01.370> my<00:05:01.520> skin<00:05:01.940> um<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.960> for<00:05:03.289> my<00:05:03.409> eye<00:05:03.440> so

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
for my for my skin um and for my eye so

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.680 
for my for my skin um and for my eye so
I<00:05:03.860> think<00:05:03.919> it's<00:05:04.220> actually<00:05:04.479> secretly<00:05:05.479> getting

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
I think it's actually secretly getting
