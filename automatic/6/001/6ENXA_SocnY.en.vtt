the biggest step up in the last 23 years

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
the biggest step up in the last 23 years
that<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.310> amount<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.549> goals<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:26.970> gone<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.270> and

that the amount of goals has gone up and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
that the amount of goals has gone up and
that's<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.710> judged<00:01:28.920> on

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
sprinters I'm most horrible my screen

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.319 
sprinters I'm most horrible my screen
and<00:02:48.200> stuff<00:02:48.519> if<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.670> actually<00:02:49.819> worked<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.269> the

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
and stuff if I actually worked in the

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.699 
and stuff if I actually worked in the
spring<00:02:50.540> style<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:50.959> well<00:02:51.109> pumping<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> arms

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
spring style as well pumping the arms

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.710 
spring style as well pumping the arms
high<00:02:52.220> knees<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:53.180> would<00:02:53.269> help<00:02:53.359> me<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.569> as

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
high knees that would help me out as

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.360 
high knees that would help me out as
well<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.139> I<00:02:54.230> probably<00:02:54.709> recommend<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:57.370> this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
well so I probably recommend that this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.589 
well so I probably recommend that this
one<00:02:58.549> man<00:02:58.670> as<00:02:58.760> he<00:02:58.849> gives<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> opportunity<00:02:59.299> for

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599
