00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.130
 And then there are some people who are 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.380
 one more video here that I'm going to address the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.720
 unite audi was marvel but better than 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.869
 What is this, man? Well, this is a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.600
 major reformulation of a new phase of 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.180
 marvel universe that will start with 60 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.370
 titles in October 2015 there in 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.379
 United States for those who do not know the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.290
 secret wars that the great bh saga 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.900
 this year of the marvelous universe where 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.640
 characters are facing each other 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.980
 including alternative versions of 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.540
 parallel lines interacting in order 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.910
 all this 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.809
 new titles have appeared and amaro has already released 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.940
 the news of 45 is theirs with sayings and 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.360
 creative team ad 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.239
 the point is that the main characters 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.030
 publishers were replaced stores noel 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.580
 of captain america hulk is no longer a few 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.619
 benner makes it a tony female version 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 stark no one knows it's the spider man 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.619
 not the peter parker anymore 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.539
 then the more conservative voters 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.479
 stand with one foot behind because they have burned 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.420
 is doing this is the bead being movies 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.340
 in the movies will not hit actually has 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.929
 obviously some kicks and I believe 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 that this has everything to do with the universe 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.130
 of the marvel film that I think 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 that will serve as a test to see the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.479
 readers' reception with these changes. 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 of how the market is going to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.069
 working with this change the criticism 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.319
 because you know that in cinema the 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.590
 actors are aging environment is not 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.770
 be able to be ôôôô peter parker the same actor 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.709
 for 50 years as in the comics can 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.840
 to be is is is hip has and how do you do 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.630
 this in the movies obviously not then 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.890
 perhaps be a test for the renewal of 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.800
 franchises 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.140
 So this is the machismo of mine I think 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.090
 It's all okay with the version 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.429
 movie of the marvel universe 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 because that's what give money to disney 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.840
 today then disney will not fail to 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.810
 explore this and will use the comics 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.599
 to perceive a certain receptivity or 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.070
 not from readers in this regard 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.480
 Good crowd were announced several 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.970
 titles titles to 15 surprise 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.370
 such as a monthly 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.159
 karnak which is a sweet in the anus 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.920
 also has the supreme squadron 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.349
 obviously all these groups 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 elections they are modified 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.049
 so we have at least six members 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.690
 the mutant avengers in humans is the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.629
 team of avengers without the characters 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.579
 at least not with the versions 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.269
 theirs 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.670
 the falcon replace the captain america the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.090
 hulk nobody knows who still has some 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.230
 bets like hercules own thor that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.319
 is no longer the classic touch is the jeans ã 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.319
 the amadeus or else there's a crowd there 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.090
 might your hulk come 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.640
 so I have many many things 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 have some titles 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.160
 surprising but one point is how far 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.980
 that the publisher is going from there I believe 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 that is a temporary phase will not be 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.769
 something that will stretch too long that will 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.010
 For years I believe it will be a 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.049
 thing to my parallel because the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.190
 characters leading publishers will not 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.380
 cease to exist 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.720
 bloggers now continue to lose one 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.849
 supersoldado's serum he's older 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.709
 the bruce banner will also continue 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.359
 within the marvel universe but no more 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.329
 how incredible hulk no longer as captain 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.549
 america then i believe they will 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.819
 stay there and take a break maybe 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.599
 with marvel planning something more solid 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.660
 something is really going to please the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.799
 readers with a saga of really 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.480
 quality 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.540
 I think this gives the characters some time 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.379
 is to give a breathed and kind power 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.970
 work with these characters 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.220
 main 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.319
 So, what do you think of this? 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.079
 about marriage and audi for I'm going to leave 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.120
 in the inscription here the list of titles and 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.760
 your creative teams 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.010
 then you can be sure that they will 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.650
 be amazed at the creative teams 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.560
 and with the formations of the president of 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.960
 groups to the title of the archer hawk 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.240
 for example is the is the globe verberou 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.000
 character in the 70's 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.990
 so if you have several modifications 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.030
 because then I really think it can of 60 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.830
 titles I believe that all 15 to 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.270
 at least by writers at 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.820
 helles well disarm the end of the year emir 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.020
 robinson mark waid I think these guys 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.030
 there more seasoned in the comics has 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
 a great chance to get a good start 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.000

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.600
