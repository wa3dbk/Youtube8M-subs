this strategy called lazy farming which
I<00:00:57.629> name<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> lazy<00:00:58.379> family<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.309> very

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I name it lazy family because it's very

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.020 
I name it lazy family because it's very
very<00:01:00.539> simple<00:01:00.980> listen<00:01:01.980> farming<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
very simple listen farming is actually a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170 
very simple listen farming is actually a
very<00:01:03.329> simple<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> farming<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.460> using<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
very simple way of farming and using the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
very simple way of farming and using the
least<00:01:06.510> amount<00:01:06.689> troops<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
least amount troops for example in this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700 
least amount troops for example in this
page<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> resource

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
page you can see that the resource

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890 
page you can see that the resource
available<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.060> quite<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> lot

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
available to do is actually quite a lot

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.609 
available to do is actually quite a lot
however<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.990> zoom<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
however if you actually zoom down and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.310 
however if you actually zoom down and
see<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> Alexis<00:01:18.000> origin<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.930> cold

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
see all the Alexis origin the cold

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.399 
see all the Alexis origin the cold
storage<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.110> much

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
storage you can see that it's not much

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.520

filled up India the storage it means

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370 
filled up India the storage it means
that<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.159> player<00:01:26.640> didn't<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.930> collect
