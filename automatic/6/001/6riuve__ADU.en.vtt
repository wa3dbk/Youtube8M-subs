performance you get a spectator so you
select<00:00:12.300> cars<00:00:13.429> so<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:14.969> select<00:00:15.619> this<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:17.060> have

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
select cars so they select this one have

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.580 
select cars so they select this one have

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
that stuff just put it back on the top

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.769 
that stuff just put it back on the top
you<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:23.990> shuffle<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:26.490> card<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.750> deck

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
you then shuffle the card into the deck

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.709 
you then shuffle the card into the deck
just<00:00:28.970> make<00:00:29.970> sure<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:32.210> nice<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
just make sure it's you know nice and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.920 
just make sure it's you know nice and
shuffled<00:00:35.930> shuffles<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:38.390> all<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> good

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
shuffled shuffles and all that good

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:58.240 
shuffled shuffles and all that good
stuff<00:00:47.870> okay<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:53.180> reckon<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.809> card<00:00:57.230> is

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
stuff okay so I reckon that your card is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
stuff okay so I reckon that your card is
the<00:00:59.250> bottom<00:00:59.579> card<00:01:01.039> No<00:01:02.899> okay<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.439> what

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the bottom card No okay let's see what

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.230 
the bottom card No okay let's see what
do<00:01:05.720> get<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> deck<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> rub<00:01:08.119> blow<00:01:09.119> on

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
do get the deck a bit of a rub blow on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.030
