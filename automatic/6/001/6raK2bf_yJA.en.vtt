00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.670 

okay<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> continuation<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay this is a continuation of the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.259 
okay this is a continuation of the
trimming<00:00:05.990> now<00:00:06.990> here's<00:00:07.290> an<00:00:07.440> example<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
trimming now here's an example of a

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.310 
trimming now here's an example of a
chute<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:10.620> way<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> cut<00:00:11.309> here<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.030> cut<00:00:12.320> at

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
chute the way I cut here is to cut at

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.420 
chute the way I cut here is to cut at
this<00:00:13.799> very<00:00:14.099> low<00:00:14.429> node<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.039> cut<00:00:17.250> it

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this very low node see you can cut it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.230 
this very low node see you can cut it
actually<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.710> second<00:00:20.210> node<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
actually that is the second node and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.500 
actually that is the second node and
this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.529> node<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.300> do

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this is the first node but you see I do

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200 
this is the first node but you see I do
not<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.990> things<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.430> because

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
not like things like this because

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.950 
not like things like this because
they're<00:00:27.420> too<00:00:27.630> straight<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> next<00:00:30.420> chute

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
they're too straight and the next chute

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.690 
they're too straight and the next chute
that<00:00:31.489> will<00:00:32.489> grow<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that will grow is from here and in this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
that will grow is from here and in this
side<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.690> instead<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.079> least<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.620> will<00:00:37.770> be

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
side see instead of least there will be

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.340 
side see instead of least there will be
a<00:00:37.950> new<00:00:38.160> suit<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> will<00:00:38.730> grow<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a new suit that will grow from here so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
a new suit that will grow from here so
the<00:00:40.829> problem<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:42.000> like

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the problem is that this I do not like

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.229 
the problem is that this I do not like
to<00:00:42.360> look<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.340> which<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.550> very

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to look at this one which is very

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.639 
to look at this one which is very
straight<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:47.450> like<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> this

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
straight a cut there like that this

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
straight a cut there like that this
portion<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> portion<00:00:51.449> will

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
portion up to this portion will

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.700 
portion up to this portion will
eventually<00:00:52.559> die<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.579> fall<00:00:54.120> off<00:00:54.379> see<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
eventually die and fall off see this is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
eventually die and fall off see this is
safer<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.199> eventually

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
safer because this will eventually

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000 
safer because this will eventually
dehydrate<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> die<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> suits<00:01:01.770> will

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
dehydrate and die so the suits will

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
dehydrate and die so the suits will
actually<00:01:04.460> grow<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.479> node<00:01:06.720> see

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
actually grow only at this node see

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:07.940 
actually grow only at this node see
that's<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that's how I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's how I
that's<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.729> should<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.360> cut<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.350> sometimes

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's how should I cut but sometimes

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
that's how should I cut but sometimes
I'd<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.420> shorter<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I'd like it to be shorter so that so and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.539 
I'd like it to be shorter so that so and
that's<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> usually<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
that's I will do that usually because I

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
that's I will do that usually because I
the<00:01:20.549> plants<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:23.509> very<00:01:24.509> healthier<00:01:24.960> by

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the plants have to be very healthier by

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.660 
the plants have to be very healthier by
grows<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.080> ensure<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
grows so that you can ensure that this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.230 
grows so that you can ensure that this
remaining<00:01:30.540> suit<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.140> die<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.240> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
remaining suit will not die so this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
remaining suit will not die so this
another<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> cut<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:35.070> short<00:01:35.430> here

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
another here I cut with very short here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.560 
another here I cut with very short here
like<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
like that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.350 
like that
if<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.869> branches<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.159> new<00:01:41.579> twigs<00:01:42.119> are

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
if the branches are if the new twigs are

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.719 
if the branches are if the new twigs are
too<00:01:42.799> too<00:01:43.799> long<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.560> see<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
too too long like this one see this is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.810 
too too long like this one see this is
the<00:01:48.000> last<00:01:48.509> node<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> where<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> cut

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the last node and this is where I cut

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
the last node and this is where I cut
and<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.899> too<00:01:52.229> long<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.899> usually<00:01:55.770> put

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and this is too long I and I usually put

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.039 
and this is too long I and I usually put
it<00:01:56.369> back<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.290> grow<00:01:58.290> another

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
it back and grow another

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.249 
it back and grow another
yeah<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.939> let's<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:05.899> very<00:02:06.899> short

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
yeah so let's do this one is very short

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.910 
yeah so let's do this one is very short
note<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:09.110> long<00:02:10.110> interlude<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
note and this one is long interlude so

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.600 
note and this one is long interlude so
it's<00:02:11.250> rather<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:12.060> cutting<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.629> there<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's rather than cutting it there and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
it's rather than cutting it there and
remaining<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:16.459> got<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:18.330> short<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
remaining this I got that short so that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.520 
remaining this I got that short so that
is<00:02:24.319> how<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.349> trim<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.950> course<00:02:27.019> your<00:02:28.019> objective

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
is how to trim of course your objective

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.509 
is how to trim of course your objective
when<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.069> reach<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.489> lower<00:02:29.610> branches<00:02:31.519> like

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
when you reach the lower branches like

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.610 
when you reach the lower branches like
this<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.450> would<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.080> grow<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
this one you would like to grow it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.140 
this one you would like to grow it
laterally<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:37.440> example<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:39.239> this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
laterally so for example in this this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.930 
laterally so for example in this this
suit<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.750> very<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.920> upwards<00:02:44.730> then

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
suit it is going very very upwards then

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.569 
suit it is going very very upwards then
you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.329> cut<00:02:45.599> very<00:02:45.930> short<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:49.579> for

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
you can cut very short but if for

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.370 
you can cut very short but if for
example<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.540> growing<00:02:51.750> laterally

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
example this one it's growing laterally

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.089 
example this one it's growing laterally
then<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.370> might<00:02:53.549> allow<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.360> might<00:02:54.829> cut<00:02:55.829> only

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
then you might allow you might cut only

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.880 
then you might allow you might cut only
here<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.720> eventually<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
here so that eventually as you do that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.390 
here so that eventually as you do that
your<00:02:59.849> branches<00:03:00.750> grows<00:03:01.110> literally<00:03:02.329> see<00:03:04.400> groose

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
your branches grows literally see groose

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.879 
your branches grows literally see groose
wider<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.350> top<00:03:07.620> one<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.190> would<00:03:08.579> like<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
wider but the top one you would like to

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.090 
wider but the top one you would like to
cut<00:03:10.889> very<00:03:11.190> grossly<00:03:11.720> because<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.769> combat

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
cut very grossly because the combat

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.910 
cut very grossly because the combat
apical<00:03:14.790> dominance<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.389> eligible<00:03:16.019> for<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
apical dominance that eligible for the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.940 
apical dominance that eligible for the
plants<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.670> grow<00:03:18.030> more<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.620> upper

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
plants is to grow more on the upper

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.160 
plants is to grow more on the upper
portion<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> plant<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.739> plant<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
portion of the plant of the plant and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.300 
portion of the plant of the plant and
sometimes<00:03:26.930> consumes<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.139> resources<00:03:28.680> at<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
sometimes consumes the resources at the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.530 
sometimes consumes the resources at the
top<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> no<00:03:30.359> more<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.660> left<00:03:30.930> at<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.829> bottom

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
top and no more is left at the bottom

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.680 
top and no more is left at the bottom
see<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.620> example<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.700> I'm

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
see like for example this one and I'm

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.099 
see like for example this one and I'm
also<00:03:37.049> cutting<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.220> hard<00:03:38.489> back<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.930> one

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
also cutting it hard back and this one

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.349 
also cutting it hard back and this one
it's<00:03:40.319> growing<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.220> way<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:41.639> then<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.150> also

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
it's growing all the way up then I also

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.589 
it's growing all the way up then I also
cut<00:03:42.690> back<00:03:42.959> cut<00:03:44.090> okay<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:46.019> one<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:47.579> that's<00:03:48.299> the

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
cut back cut okay this one so that's the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.050 
cut back cut okay this one so that's the
principle<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.920> decide<00:03:50.280> whether<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.849> cut

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
principle so you decide whether you cut

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.800 
principle so you decide whether you cut
one<00:03:51.359> node<00:03:51.630> only<00:03:51.840> or<00:03:52.739> two<00:03:53.130> nodes<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.810> for

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
one node only or two nodes and for

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.390 
one node only or two nodes and for
example<00:03:55.079> in<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:55.680> if<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:55.980> would<00:03:56.040> like<00:03:56.250> to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
example in this one if you would like to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.509 
example in this one if you would like to
make<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.700> sharper<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.389> this<00:03:57.599> like<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.519> to

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
make it sharper like this like that to

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.059 
make it sharper like this like that to
make<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> triangle<00:04:00.329> sharper<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.859> have

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
make the triangle sharper then you have

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.000 
make the triangle sharper then you have
to<00:04:02.340> for<00:04:03.060> example<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:03.690> one<00:04:03.750> since<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:04.829> is

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
to for example on this one since this is

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.099 
to for example on this one since this is
the<00:04:05.190> apex<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.730> you'd<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.359> this<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.870> be<00:04:06.989> a

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
the apex and you'd like this to be a

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.819 
the apex and you'd like this to be a
little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.760> firm<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:10.500> can

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
little bit firm like that then you can

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.210 
little bit firm like that then you can
cut<00:04:11.099> only<00:04:11.640> at<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.030> side

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
cut only at the side

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.170 
cut only at the side
let<00:04:13.550> this<00:04:15.430> instead<00:04:16.430> not<00:04:16.640> remain<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.510> like<00:04:17.780> that

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
let this instead not remain so like that

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.350 
let this instead not remain so like that
so<00:04:20.180> that's<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.810> way<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:20.959> trim<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:22.580> good

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
so that's the way I trim and good

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.720 
so that's the way I trim and good
morning
