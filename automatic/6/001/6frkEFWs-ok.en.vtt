00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.279
 Usually it starts with one 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.230
 first team conference in the us 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.699
 put together and ever coarse 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.460
 think in which direction could that be 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.279
 go and what other big ones 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.349
 Subject-matter-related topics still occur in this way 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.569
 I would test the popular models 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.149
 which are currently on the market are 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.070
 and 8 pieces and the animals all because 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.760
 in all areas of public transport too 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.160
 to meet 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.859
 to see the advantage of these things 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.899
 that they both sober if you have 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.749
 the online programs are under test 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.219
 I noticed that quite big 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.079
 There are differences between the individual 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.820
 equipment has been practicing for some time now 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.559
 time in the trend in the bast leave at 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.190
 but also complain in the industry r'n'b 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.670
 Artists 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.329
 Fortunately , 3d printer is mccomb 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.339
 a problem 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.809
 4k monitors are exciting because they are one 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.909
 very high resolution offer some 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.970
 monitor world ran complaining to others 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.790
 pictures shown told by the 3 improved 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.479
 the support is much more emotional 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.549
 1700 pages comprehensive 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.479
 you have to be lucky 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.939
 do not read through 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.079
 but if you know that kind of 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.030
 the program works 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.259
 we close all functions then 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.840
 by trying out 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.759
 the ingenious mac os dancer that it 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 has a very cheap software 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.420
 you turn to be and mac installed 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.310
 in this server on it very handy 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.280
 is just this cashier service and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.229
 is not on your own long line 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 possibly each mac 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.380
 user 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.910
 canon quick look spotlight that dr 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.770
 one works with daily if one 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.440
 Look at it more closely then are 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 That's maybe 30 percent of the base 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.930
 functions that you get to know 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 You can easily get asx around you 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.300
 expand artist 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.950
 everything a mini has any 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.480
 can come your own shortcut and there 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.010
 I noticed that one this 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.940
 artist too simply other macs 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.410
 can transfer 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.030
 That's why I have a little job 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.370
 just made that shortcut 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 extracted and but can backup file 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.729
 then you slide on each other on the mac 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.280
 is the first series of devices and the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.770
 work too and I was 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 Surprised how precise it is 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.920
 example very cheap acting 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.240
 stick to documents 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.190
 It is also important that the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.050
 editors think over what exactly 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.660
 show where so sometimes it is like that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.070
 they do not know exactly what 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.680
 They attach great importance to everyone 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.990
 editor his text from the beginning to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 cared for at the end and fully behind it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.930
 can stand 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.850
 so we left the texte 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
 against each other against the colleagues 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.670
 then they work around and bring themselves 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.830
 in sentence then contact the editor 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 recorded and the text if necessary 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.209
 shortened and then it comes to the whole 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.769
 Last conclusion will be back 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.570
 again a shoulder look and made 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.700
 then it will be in the printing as pdf 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.860
 So transfer the beginning of the title 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.620
 Design is a 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.330
 layout meetings the editorial that 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.720
 means I meet with the editor 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.980
 and the chief editor 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.220
 let's say as much information as 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.590
 possible about the topic and make 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.530
 suggestions for a picture idea that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.980
 fine tuning of the cover image is a 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.870
 communicative process of very strong 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.270
 also controlled by the editor 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.420
 while we Icking online in the 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.270
 Internet every day everything important 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.800
 happens to summarize in short messages 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.610
 that helps a lot more in that 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.130
 depth brings a lot more 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 advanced detailed 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.720
 subtle contents that you neither at 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.340
 us on the other internet sites 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 in the front, look with the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.670
 editors look together with us 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.680
 in a database which topics themselves 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.270
 in my opinion suitable or will 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.580
 from the currently addressed hey there 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.890
 I was something that somehow moved in well 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.600
 Pictures can take the reader has one 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.709
 app the possibility between two readers 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.930
 views 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.480
 that means he has the original one 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.360
 in the same way as it is in the print and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.580
 also a layout which is interactive 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.620
 the contents on the ipad in 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.600
 represented two columns so that alisa 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.340
 in the right column finds the text 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.110
 and in the left column 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.630
 An appropriate text point anchored 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.340
 pictures videos and tables the readers 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.959
 We really appreciate it that we are 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.950
 so thoroughly and in detail with the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.380
 Themes occupy them 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.690
 interested and that we are always in 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.620
 Right moment on the right topic 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.620
 I believe
