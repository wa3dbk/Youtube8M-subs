some<00:00:29.689> racing<00:00:30.290> before<00:00:30.500> what<00:00:31.369> do<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:31.550> think<00:00:31.820> of

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
some racing before what do you think of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.220

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
seen it on TV maybe I heard about it but

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:15.910 
seen it on TV maybe I heard about it but
until<00:01:15.229> you're<00:01:15.350> actually<00:01:15.439> here<00:01:15.740> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
until you're actually here and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.169 
until you're actually here and

appreciate fully how you know how
amazing<00:01:20.209> actually<00:01:20.569> is<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.109> I<00:01:21.139> think<00:01:21.560> that's

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
amazing actually is so I think that's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.319 
amazing actually is so I think that's
what's<00:01:22.310> made<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.639> grow<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:22.909> know<00:01:22.939> these<00:01:23.149> guys

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
what's made it grow you know these guys

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.120 
what's made it grow you know these guys
like<00:01:23.600> Lorenzo<00:01:23.840> Rasta<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.469> volcom<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.920> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
like Lorenzo Rasta the volcom of and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.879 
like Lorenzo Rasta the volcom of and
seen<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.759> just<00:01:26.299> gone<00:01:26.420> Wow<00:01:26.779> and<00:01:27.079> then<00:01:27.529> I<00:01:27.799> think

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
seen it I just gone Wow and then I think

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.379 
seen it I just gone Wow and then I think
it's<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:28.159> start<00:01:28.429> to<00:01:28.579> gather<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:29.060> bit<00:01:29.240> more

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
it's just start to gather a bit more

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.969 
it's just start to gather a bit more
momentum<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.020> hopefully<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.770> keep<00:01:30.889> moving

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
momentum so hopefully just keep moving

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.029 
momentum so hopefully just keep moving
forward<00:01:32.200> you've<00:01:33.200> obviously<00:01:33.319> had<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.679> couple<00:01:33.889> of

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
forward you've obviously had a couple of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.769 
forward you've obviously had a couple of
days<00:01:34.189> in<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.459> Isle<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.700> Man<00:01:34.939> not<00:01:35.329> necessarily

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
to try and compare short circuit riders

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.660 
to try and compare short circuit riders
with<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> road<00:02:28.510> races<00:02:29.080> very<00:02:30.070> difficult<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.550> do

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
with the road races very difficult to do

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.700 
with the road races very difficult to do
that<00:02:30.820> very<00:02:31.030> different<00:02:31.450> disciplines<00:02:31.990> how<00:02:32.650> do

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
that very different disciplines how do

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.530 
that very different disciplines how do
you<00:02:32.800> feel<00:02:33.160> about<00:02:33.220> road<00:02:33.700> racers<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.390> view

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you feel about road racers do you view

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.150 
you feel about road racers do you view
them<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:34.720> professional<00:02:35.380> sportsman<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.980> same

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
them as professional sportsman the same

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
them as professional sportsman the same
way<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.370> would<00:02:36.550> somebody<00:02:36.850> doing<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.630> job<00:02:37.840> oh

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
way you would somebody doing your job oh

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.680 
way you would somebody doing your job oh
yeah<00:02:38.620> without<00:02:38.890> question<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.060> there<00:02:40.540> is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
yeah without question and but there is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.450 
yeah without question and but there is
that<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:41.080> think<00:02:41.650> there's<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> different<00:02:42.160> mindset

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
that I think there's a different mindset

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.930 
that I think there's a different mindset
in<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.420> rod<00:02:43.810> road<00:02:44.380> racing<00:02:44.770> rather<00:02:45.100> than<00:02:45.310> short

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
in in rod road racing rather than short

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.490 
in in rod road racing rather than short
circuit<00:02:46.300> racing<00:02:46.570> which<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.810> why<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.110> hard<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
circuit racing which is why it's hard to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.410 
circuit racing which is why it's hard to
sew<00:02:48.130> some<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.459> guys<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.820> adapt<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.240> mean

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
