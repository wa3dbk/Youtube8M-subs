00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.899
 we arrive 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.939
 hi to all and dream to people get 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.500
 find for a new video 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.089
 gold today is a bit of a video 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.290
 particular and yes there in first 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.510
 handle I propose to rifle and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.860
 so they thank you for advancing me accept 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.330
 it would really make me really happy 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 and that would make me a little more discover 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.809
 the community will settle it anyway 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.610
 a small committee to my soul but it's 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.370
 always nice to discover 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.199
 new people and who appreciate 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.809
 more or less your job and then the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.160
 second originality of this video and 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.160
 of this gameplay is that today I 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.170
 do not make impulsive or more meaningful 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.210
 we are a thing of whew in the snipe no 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.609
 today I present you a video 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 in general melee during this video 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.350
 in this gameplay I try and so the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.110
 title exploded so my faith this challenge 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.670
 rather because because 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.899
 may the finals it's not very simple 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.220
 with all that hangs on the gentleman 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.840
 in magic a lot of luck I 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.520
 both skin and that of the thing that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.509
 miss a lot of his balls and I 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.390
 verrines somehow 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.610
 so yeah a title explodes is very 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.799
 very complicated because already 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.479
 adapt these movements concretely 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.960
 may in egypt for scrum mode 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.119
 General 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.890
 me personally I do not have any 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.409
 the habit of playing in this mode is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 so it was a little changed a game that me 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.200
 not displeased but necessarily who will say 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 success or attempts 10 fail and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.399
 success and I confess that before you 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.979
 to achieve a good gameplay like this 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.799
 I still had a lot 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.259
 wrong between facts and say the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.430
 files before the facts it all silly with 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.549
 the equipment and on that I have 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.619
 decided to take assets such as 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.189
 those I took today with 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.799
 accessories 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.399
 so for this gameplay I took the 10 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.259
 25 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.560
 fast chargers the stick the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.229
 ghost muffler toughness looters 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.940
 and engineers then for that I make you 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.739
 trust in you are pros so 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.350
 you can busy understand everything but 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.780
 it's a bit for me the assets and the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.790
 suitable accessories for this mode because 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.840
 that without ghost it is very very 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.450
 complicated without silent too 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.069
 and who says attempt me today I 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.050
 waiting for him at the 25th so I wanted 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.780
 make a linear attempt in the direction 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.430
 where I used that weapon is so 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.879
 worse it was a bit for that to do 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.800
 pleasure 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.140
 so today I wanted to talk to you 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
 of something that is what is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.849
 defines for you a good player then 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.519
 today I do not esteem myself how or 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.670
 normal player that a certain level after 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.650
 a while I played I 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.390
 gained a lot of experience and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 today I get to have a level 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.860
 constant and in good level and do you want 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.110
 ask what do you think is 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.519
 characterizes a good day to lormont for 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.250
 me first of all what he stop there 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.430
 reese a good player is already its meaning 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.799
 shifts are brein is also 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 his shot then in the sense it's his 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.180
 sense of displacement actually 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.310
 today in general melee it's very 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.670
 very complicated to move to where 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.410
 I have a microstation but it is very 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.430
 very complicated to move in town hall 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.640
 this is not what you need to know 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.609
 to control thepoune can be seen from 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.200
 all parts of being quite discreet 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.910
 manthan to be able to do enough frags 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.319
 quickly for easter is someone who 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.790
 you double last moment when someone 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.299
 who wins the scrum before your 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.220
 attempt 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.359
 so it's super important 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.340
 moves and you'll see I like 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.170
 puff of hope but literally I 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.239
 do not know if it's here but at a 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.260
 moment i'm gonna go spawn 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.019
 but two meters away 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.510
 so it's wow it's only a lot 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.500
 a lot shocked after I had the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.660
 luck because I have the VSAT 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.220
 but otherwise my attempt would have failed 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.519
 by the way I have a small bonus at the end 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.880
 which in my opinion please you at the level of 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.950
 shoot 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.720
 football is very important 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.700
 shooting with some 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.590
 accuracy on to your opponent and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.840
 I admit that if you have you will see 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.010
 a lot of bad bookeen so shoot it 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.829
 for me he is very much connected with 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.380
 alarm with which you will play 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.450
 for example with the tipp 25 it'll be 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.609
 very very complicated to type in 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.060
 football languages while with a smg 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.789
 it's a little simpler and so there already 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.729
 I swam her beauty but frankly 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.740
 it depends on the rdr that can be played 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.810
 in melee then I can quote 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.669
 in this case the fal what the fal you 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.920
 put one or two bullets and to the body to 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.530
 body is not so 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.500
 so that unlike some weapons 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.550
 and the aero this little 25 actually it's 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.980
 semi smg for me because it is 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.720
 rather handy and then we can win 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.790
 nevertheless, these duels in close combat 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.310
 traitor to face very very easily so 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.160
 his skis nice with 7.1 I wanted 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.540
 also talk about the brain the brain is this 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.070
 which is also linked to displacement 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.950
 Tomorrow it's going to make you a good 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.500
 player because a day without brain in 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.570
 big so without meaning that we will say 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.800
 it's a rate a player who even if he 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.320
 will have a sick shoot 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.060
 it will do nothing at all ie if 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.740
 you have the best shoot world and 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.630
 you do not have the displacements had 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.460
 not the little one you're going to have a lot 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.190
 a lot of trouble I can tell you because 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.310
 think two years for example 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.620
 if there are three emirs in front of you 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.580
 of course you have to kill the person 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.810
 who is best able to kill you and in 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.930
 some situations it's very 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.000
 important so the shoot and the darling so 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.680
 that's what for me defined in good 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.010
 players so here we come to the end of 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.020
 the video 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.190
 and this is the extreme situation I am 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.660
 take a ball right behind the 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.280
 buttocks but I see an enemy who is 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.980
 tip in front of me and then I kill him so 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.420
 here I come 30 0 I get the title 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.600
 exploded and I wanted to put you a 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.920
 little bonus so the cinematic that you 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.990
 shows how I made a take 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.020
 a high ball last so who see 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.220
 the sniper at the bottom is the ball so 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.980
 here I hope they enjoyed this 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.260
 video for my part I hope you 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.250
 have appreciated so we find ourselves for 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.330
 a new video on my channel 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.190
 do not hesitate to take a little tour and 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.060
 I thank for advanced that topics for 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.060
 their taf has more
