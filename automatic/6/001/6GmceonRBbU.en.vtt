00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
things on the market is the way to go

it's<00:01:15.720> established<00:01:16.470> its<00:01:16.590> successful<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
sand which removes iron but that's it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
sand which removes iron but that's it
peroxide<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.320> removes<00:01:25.710> bacteria<00:01:26.009> but

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
peroxide which removes bacteria but

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.950 
peroxide which removes bacteria but
that's<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.790> our<00:01:29.790> system<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.750> give

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that's it so our system is going to give

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
that's it so our system is going to give
you<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> dollar<00:01:31.890> spent<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:33.299> high<00:01:33.930> quality

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you for the dollar spent a high quality

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899 
you for the dollar spent a high quality
water<00:01:34.619> without<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> bacteria<00:01:35.520> without<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
water without the bacteria without the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.810 
water without the bacteria without the
iron<00:01:36.090> without<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.600> sulfur<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> believe

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
iron without the sulfur so I believe

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.179 
iron without the sulfur so I believe
that<00:01:38.850> chlorination<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> way<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> go

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that chlorination is the way to go

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
that chlorination is the way to go
and<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.700> you'll<00:01:41.850> find<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.240> our<00:01:42.420> system

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and I think you'll find that our system

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
and I think you'll find that our system
is<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> easiest<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> maintain

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
is about the easiest to maintain

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
is about the easiest to maintain
price-wise<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.899> design<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.560> build<00:01:46.860> we

years or certainly have made some

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.830 
years or certainly have made some
improvements<00:02:05.520> within<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.630> been<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
improvements within it but it's been a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.070 
improvements within it but it's been a
very<00:02:07.110> successful<00:02:07.350> system<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.250> us<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.780> well

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
very successful system for us on on well

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
very successful system for us on on well
it<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> simple<00:02:11.520> process<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.330> klore

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it is a simple process of klore

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
it is a simple process of klore
sending<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.740> retention<00:02:15.100> tank<00:02:15.520> which<00:02:15.760> is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
sending it to a retention tank which is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.780 
sending it to a retention tank which is
an<00:02:16.060> opportunity<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.170> water<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.190> contact

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
an opportunity for the water to contact

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.760 
an opportunity for the water to contact
with<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.690> chlorine<00:02:19.960> so<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.410> kills<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
with the chlorine so it kills the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.130 
with the chlorine so it kills the
bacteria<00:02:21.060> irons<00:02:22.060> also<00:02:22.360> heavier<00:02:22.690> than<00:02:22.930> water

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
bacteria irons also heavier than water

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.750 
bacteria irons also heavier than water
so<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.590> going<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.800> settle<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> bottom<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
so it's going to settle to the bottom of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.580 
so it's going to settle to the bottom of
that<00:02:24.880> tank<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:25.960> notice<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:26.500> our

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
that tank you will notice on our

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.380 
that tank you will notice on our
pictures<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.400> there's<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.670> clean-out<00:02:28.000> valve

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
pictures that there's a clean-out valve

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720 
pictures that there's a clean-out valve
on<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.750> bottom<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.530> means<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.160> once<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
on the bottom that means that once a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.250 
on the bottom that means that once a
month<00:02:30.880> you'll<00:02:31.090> open<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.810> you'll<00:02:31.900> find

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
month you'll open it up and you'll find

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.500 
month you'll open it up and you'll find
that<00:02:32.530> iron<00:02:32.830> comes<00:02:33.370> out<00:02:33.550> because<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.360> has

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that iron comes out because it has

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.420 
that iron comes out because it has
settled<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.350> bottom<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.250> been

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
settled to the bottom because it's been

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.550 
settled to the bottom because it's been
in<00:02:36.550> contact<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.270> chlorination<00:02:37.720> keep<00:02:38.410> in

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
in contact with the chlorination keep in

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.810 
in contact with the chlorination keep in
mind<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.010> peroxide<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> non<00:02:41.820> non

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
mind that peroxide is a non non

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.090 
mind that peroxide is a non non
separable<00:02:43.600> material<00:02:44.140> which<00:02:44.260> means<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.680> bonds

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
separable material which means it bonds

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
separable material which means it bonds
to<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> water<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.210> means<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.780> can't

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
to the water so that means you can't

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530 
to the water so that means you can't
separate<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.800> once<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.460> use<00:02:48.700> peroxide<00:02:48.970> you're

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
separate it once you use peroxide you're

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.970 
separate it once you use peroxide you're
going<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.750> drink<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.140> however<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.710> feel<00:02:50.920> about

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
going to drink it however you feel about

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.850 
going to drink it however you feel about
that<00:02:51.460> but<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:53.020> what<00:02:53.170> we're<00:02:53.320> doing<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.710> taking

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
that but so what we're doing is taking

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.740 
that but so what we're doing is taking
the<00:02:54.100> chlorinator<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> retention<00:02:55.180> tank<00:02:55.600> and

the chlorinator to a retention tank and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
of course the final tank which is to me

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.460 
of course the final tank which is to me
the<00:02:57.760> most<00:02:57.910> important<00:02:58.510> whether<00:02:59.020> it's<00:02:59.230> city
