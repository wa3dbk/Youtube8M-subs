00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.370
 video in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.649
 the finger tricks that I use to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 execute them that I'm going to leave the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 algorithm down while executing it but 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 They should know this already and also 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.560
 I'm going to teach how I do the finger 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 tricks so that the permutation is more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 quick and everyone knows that the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 g type permutations are among the most 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 angry that there are I found several 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.300
 ways to solve the 44 permutations 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.800
 type g I learned a way to solve them 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 with finger tricks that the truth is that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 I like them and they are comfortable for me 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 I curse everything that wags when I 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 I'm going to show you the fingers 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.300
 six that I use should already know 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 recognize what permutations are 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 type g if you do not recognize them I'm going to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.170
 teach here the permutations type g 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 let's say you have only two pieces 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.730
 which are the same color two corners of the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 same color are called lights you have two 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 lights of any color always and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 when they are the same color and this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 side let's see somewhere a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 two for one bar in this case is 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.360
 here the bar the bar can be 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.430
 here here here or here I 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.060
 is when the bar is here 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.080
 I call permutation type g1 and g2 g3 g4 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.390
 always when we find these two 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.450
 little points are pointing to the left 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.360
 this is g1 and let's say the algorithm 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 parallax does not look much like the g 3 and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 the algorithm for axis 2 looks like 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.640
 much to g 4 I will teach you the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.770
 algorithm that I use for fasting the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.120
 algorithm and the finger trick the finger 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.979
 trick will have to see what 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.870
 I do and the algorithm is going to be down 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.050
 look 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.920
 this finger here pushes 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.920
 after that 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.000
 again let me put the case 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.980
 There it is again 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 well pushed without separating them from the posts 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.430
 here are two ways to do it when 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 I can do the turn with my finger 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.920
 here of only turn to e 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.920
 insert and download one last time fast 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820
 and here is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.350
 and and the next is the permutation type 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.819
 g 3 if you remember the g 1 state here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.800
 get g2 g3 g4 this is the g 3 here are 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.900
 the lights and here is the permutation 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.030
 then I seem algorithm what I do 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.880
 and what I discovered that Felix does 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 example was to do this go down 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.160
 here this finger does this movement of 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.590
 double layer think 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.590
 efe and then do this 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.040
 same lower this finger from here pushes well 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 again so fingers go down 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.019
 efe 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.390
 then I'm here on this finger does 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.430
 this 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 and the permutation ends 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.830
 and that's it and finally we go with the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.800
 last two cases that in this case is the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.930
 g2 and in jazz the g4 first I'm going to 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.390
 teach to solve this what they are going to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.460
 to do is when they see that the little dot is 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.840
 here they do this algorithm I'm going to 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.000
 leave the algorithm down but see the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.880
 end of the tri and take the piece out of there 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.880
 they turn here and then they do this 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.110
 and here is this one here is going to be the one 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.320
 will rotate 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.650
 and turning r2 good they have this they go to 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.590
 do this 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.230
 tour 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.110
 normal algorithm until you get here this 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 mini that is the one that will lower the pieces of 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.330
 here there so we do not have to remove them 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.459
 the hands to run any algorithm 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.120
 look up here and in no time 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.250
 the bucket's hands stop and that's it and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.299
 finally let's see the permutation 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.099
 type g4 the g4 is when the two are 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.160
 lights to the left to see camera not you 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.990
 put so dark 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.460
 when the two lights are equal to the 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.260
 left and now the bar is here 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.990
 back and what we are going to do is very 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.750
 similar to g2 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.130
 we do the normal algorithm and in the end 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.130
 this little finger does the same thing again 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.109
 he moves with his little finger this little finger is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.030
 the one that moves Cuba 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.400
 you come back and here are two ways to 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.979
 solve it one would be to turn and put the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.979
 piece and another would be from here doing this 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.780
 the truth I use the first way to me 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.150
 this is left after I turn and insert the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.950
 piece is like what I do but good 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.660
 first of all I have to tell you that 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.230
 if you really want to run fast it's 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.170
 the permutations is pure practice I do not 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.000
 I know it 's like any other permutation 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.710
 practice in permutation many times 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.810
 and the finger trick and the truth is that it is 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.920
 a finger trick is so simple it 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.380
 makes it so simple to do that 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.020
 permutation that the permutation you like 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.370
 the first thing you like now there is a 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.120
 genia do not shit on everything that is 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.020
 wags and the second is that it is comfortable 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.910
 it is is convenient it is fast only 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.040
 you have to practice it is very easy and very 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.740
 intuitive is so easy and intuitive that 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.420
 very fast you will have a hard time getting used to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.190
 the finger tricks but well there they are 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.440
 my finger clicks too if you do not 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.300
 you knew lage I recommend you learn 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.060
 directly with these finger tricks 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.250
 this is the is for all for everything 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.720
 public is a family program the 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.430
 truth is that many people and me 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.590
 they had asked me to tell them how I 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.910
 makes permutations type g because 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.070
 when uploading videos 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.540
 the cube I do not know about several people 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.060
 they had asked how I did the 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.950
 permutations type g then this is what 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.260
 that I use I do not know if it's the best but it's 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.030
 what I use what pleases me and what 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.010
 which is what's cool then 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.720
 up here was the video today you know 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.460
 that you can like if you liked it and if 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.140
 you learned something, share it with your 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.330
 friends so that you make them happier and 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.920
 they do not hate life when it comes out 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.390
 a permutation gets you to subscribe if 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.740
 you want to see more videos like this
