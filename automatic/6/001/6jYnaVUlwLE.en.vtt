00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.050
 miami 16 years old playing for the first time 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.650
 in the main wt key here 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.910
 brazil out today opponent look 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.890
 you have to say about this opponent 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 good opponent is an American not yet 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.730
 I know she did not see play and go first. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 to say that I'm very happy to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
 receiving this invitation may have 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.070
 played with the key at home in brazil with 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 and I'm very well 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 prepared well since the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 truth leaves a field with the girls to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.140
 people have been doing a specific job 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.730
 and competes is tone in the heat of santa 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 I have been for three weeks now. 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 getting used to this is enough 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.730
 mainly important for picking up 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 those europeans who have everything freezing 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.949
 lanÃºs em C was in the third set 6 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 subtitled all that energy of that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 that force that gave in and that's it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.560
 head forward and try to rest 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.840
 today is the quietest tomorrow for me 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.240
 I was also prepared to play 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.420
 up to and in the tournament under the conditions you 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.940
 come training everything is like what you should 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.060
 expect the games this year in matches 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.610
 against tennis players who are some patience 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.900
 stressed demand for these games 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 the level of the game 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.060
 here it does not have no easy game does not have 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 My mother is everyone here on merit. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.540
 everyone has ranking has nine states 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.000
 and to win a tournament with certainty that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 inside this tournament also the strong ne 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.030
 so I think the game comes with a sim 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.020
 a game with the conditions of the court of the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.750
 girl's day then believe advice 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.390
 good games are all hard games 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.430
 and I have not lost any of this and that's it 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.050
 I also think that the girl has to 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 finish on the court of course I have to 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.540
 impose a game but do so with 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.000
 I respect that it must be in 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.370
 we have that respect 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 but it's always a point right? 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.730
 and this is what everyone also 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 now this week teliana pereira 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.300
 depending on the important result 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.220
 final council of Bogota you are 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.330
 next to the khan network how much this is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.160
 important for you the tennis players 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 Brazilians are trying to track the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.900
 same way 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 and I saw her play in front of the field was 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.230
 together it's mine, it's cool, this is how I feel 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.300
 seen it so with a different theme if 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.700
 she brings an energy to us it seems 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.930
 which came to a good thing for us 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.370
 so ms is cool because you can see that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 would have everything she worked so hard to 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.200
 it has evolved since when we have had 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.020
 operate and dominated by the new 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 people see that you have to have this 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.370
 persistence has that we can 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.390
 that it was an example of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.270
 athlete player , and bring this 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.040
 It's these good things and energy to 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.710
 try to be together, and cheer and enter 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.180
 on this boat to see if Brazil 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.390
 wrap up a little to see if people 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
 break this taboo top 100 soon and let's go 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.560
 see who goes to the girls is also 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.989
 paulinha going hell 'Nanda did not 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.630
 a better example of persistence of 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.200
 out with it already has 30 years and is 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.930
 playing on the girls back and has 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.439
 I never go back to anything 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.560
 so she left the time 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.560
 so this is what is legal about 560
