00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.740

 airbrush and experience and we will it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.210
 on it about thirty four we 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.930
 also did not forget the next video, I 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 I dedicate her to do a little so 3 5 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.150
 minute video on today's video is not 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 about her today's video we have about and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.520
 BTR in general than we will say to give 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.829
 paint big have a primer spray i 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 somehow showed it which will take 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.879
 was purchased for t 90 but I think maybe 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.719
 not enough for 2 tanchik but still one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.980
 probably test the airbrush and have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.980
 here is such a ground 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.060
 the question itself is the essence of the video 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.129
 Is this primer suitable for 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.129
 what is primed water 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.640
 first question second question what and 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 Diluents are not diluted in principle. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 it is necessary because it was deni and not thick 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.630
 absolutely this is the first point and it turns out 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.440
 the second thing I want to ask is 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.040
 such paint Akanov Skye order 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.430
 a long time ago these are a couple of bottles 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.340
 It is 2 bottles, but such is all 2 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.509
 invented by the way I do not plan 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.759
 same exact to use when painting 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:49.460
 then 90 and I think I often want to ask 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:52.240
 question and 90 than we will paint to me 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.240
 estoy paint 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.620
 or windows that is ground to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 just do not have time for windows such two 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.520
 question and yes one more question this one 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 paint can be thinned 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 tamil solvent or not it is on 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 special solvent by the way i.e. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.020
 it is not fit for this gentleman i 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.950
 I understand that she can me if there is 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.420
 the method will dissolve 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 but whether it is possible to dissolve write 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.180
 in the comment 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.100
 but actually all I wanted to say in 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.100
