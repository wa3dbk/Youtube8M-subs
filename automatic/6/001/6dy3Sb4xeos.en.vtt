hello world in this video I'll be
showing<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:03.840> solve<00:00:04.710> parody<00:00:05.100> airs<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
showing you how solve parody airs on the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.570 
showing you how solve parody airs on the
four<00:00:06.089> by<00:00:06.240> four<00:00:06.420> by<00:00:06.569> four<00:00:06.810> rubik's<00:00:07.259> cube<00:00:07.589> let's

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
four by four by four rubik's cube let's

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.299 
four by four by four rubik's cube let's
get<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.940> it

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
get to it

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.009 
get to it
here's<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> first<00:00:11.700> parody<00:00:12.179> air<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.599> looks

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
here's the first parody air it looks

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.039 
here's the first parody air it looks
like<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.549> two<00:00:14.549> opposite<00:00:15.120> edges<00:00:15.269> need<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> be

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
like this two opposite edges need to be

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:30.169 
like this two opposite edges need to be
swapped<00:00:16.520> here's<00:00:17.520> how<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.910> done<00:00:29.179> sometimes

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
swapped here's how it's done sometimes

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.350 
swapped here's how it's done sometimes
you'll<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.840> edges<00:00:31.380> switch<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.360> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you'll have edges switch like this to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
you'll have edges switch like this to
solve<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.380> need<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.710> setup

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
solve this all we need are some setup

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
solve this all we need are some setup
moves<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.480> setup<00:00:36.809> moves<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.260> our<00:00:37.590> prime<00:00:37.860> view

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
moves the setup moves are our prime view

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.520 
moves the setup moves are our prime view
our<00:00:38.640> u<00:00:39.600> Prime<00:00:40.250> now<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.640> solve<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.530> by

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
our u Prime now we can solve this by

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.420 
our u Prime now we can solve this by
switching<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.160> two<00:00:44.460> pieces<00:00:48.860> now<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.890> undo

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
switching these two pieces now we undo

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450 
switching these two pieces now we undo
the<00:00:50.610> setup<00:00:50.910> moves<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:52.530> prime<00:00:52.920> u<00:00:53.430> prime

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the setup moves you our prime u prime

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.569 
the setup moves you our prime u prime
our<00:00:58.789> two<00:00:59.789> corners<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.899> switched<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
our two corners can also be switched to

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
our two corners can also be switched to
all<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> turn<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.049> into<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.559> t

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
all we have to do is turn this into a t

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.030 
all we have to do is turn this into a t
perm<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> solve<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> t<00:01:06.570> perm<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> turn

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
perm and solve it as a t perm so to turn

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
perm and solve it as a t perm so to turn
it<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.610> tea<00:01:08.880> print<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> switch

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it into a tea print you want to switch

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
it into a tea print you want to switch
these<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.040> edges<00:01:16.040> now<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> tea<00:01:18.000> room

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
these two edges now we have a tea room

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
these two edges now we have a tea room
as<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> we'll<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.340> solve

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
as you can see here and we'll just solve

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
as you can see here and we'll just solve
it<00:01:20.700> using<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.210> T<00:01:21.360> perm<00:01:21.600> algorithm<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it using the T perm algorithm if you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.789 
it using the T perm algorithm if you
don't<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> it'll<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> posted<00:01:24.590> down<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
don't know it it'll be posted down in

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.109 
don't know it it'll be posted down in
the<00:01:25.950> description<00:01:29.689> there<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:32.119> sometimes

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the description there we go sometimes

the corner switch our diagonal from each

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
the corner switch our diagonal from each
other<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:38.250> an

end<00:01:38.579> print<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.630> switch<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.710> two

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
end print first and then switch the two

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359 
end print first and then switch the two
edges<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.920> M<00:01:44.070> perm

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
edges here so I don't know what M perm

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.719 
edges here so I don't know what M perm
you<00:01:44.549> use<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> different<00:01:47.340> term

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you use so if you use a different term

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.569 
you use so if you use a different term
that<00:01:48.210> n<00:01:48.360> perm<00:01:48.899> them<00:01:49.140> me<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that n perm them me then just use that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.940 
that n perm them me then just use that
in<00:01:50.729> turn<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.360> don't<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.930> any<00:01:52.170> n<00:01:52.380> perms<00:01:52.710> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
in turn if you don't know any n perms or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.539 
in turn if you don't know any n perms or
like<00:01:53.460> whatever<00:01:54.560> again<00:01:55.560> it'll<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:55.979> posted<00:01:56.189> down

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
like whatever again it'll be posted down

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.350 
like whatever again it'll be posted down
into<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> description<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.340> go

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.450 

and<00:02:05.360> now<00:02:05.870> all<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.680> do<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.860> switch<00:02:07.160> these

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and now all we do is switch these

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:19.300 
and now all we do is switch these
corners<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.340> an<00:02:16.490> oil<00:02:16.820> parity<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.130> do

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
corners this is an oil parity what we do

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.180 
corners this is an oil parity what we do
here<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.730> as<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.080> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:21.560> only<00:02:21.680> three

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
here is as you can see here only three

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.130 
here is as you can see here only three
edges<00:02:22.490> ourself<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.270> not<00:02:23.450> possible<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.870> on

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
edges ourself that is not possible on on

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.070 
edges ourself that is not possible on on
the<00:02:24.530> 3x3<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.820> we<00:02:25.970> need<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.360> special<00:02:26.750> parity

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the 3x3 so we need a special parity

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.650 
the 3x3 so we need a special parity
algorithm<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.800> solve<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.190> -<00:02:28.490> here's<00:02:29.420> how<00:02:29.600> you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
algorithm to solve this - here's how you

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:43.990 
algorithm to solve this - here's how you
do<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:41.860> sometimes<00:02:42.860> during<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> oil<00:02:43.370> you'll

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
do it sometimes during the oil you'll

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.640 
do it sometimes during the oil you'll
get<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.240> case<00:02:44.480> where<00:02:44.750> everything<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.350> solved

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
get a case where everything is solved

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.940 
get a case where everything is solved
except<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.190> one<00:02:46.400> edge<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.800> can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
except for one edge just so that we can

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.620 
except for one edge just so that we can
solve<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.340> one<00:02:49.550> edge<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.940> not<00:02:50.240> do<00:02:50.390> anything

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
solve this one edge and not do anything

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.320 
solve this one edge and not do anything
more<00:02:51.010> there's<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.100> special<00:02:52.580> algorithm<00:02:52.850> for<00:02:53.240> it

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
more there's a special algorithm for it

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.470 
more there's a special algorithm for it
do<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.140> same<00:02:54.350> thing<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.739> we<00:02:54.890> did<00:02:55.040> before<00:02:55.480> but

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
do the same thing that we did before but

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.910 
do the same thing that we did before but
turn<00:02:56.840> all<00:02:57.110> our<00:02:57.440> RS<00:02:57.830> into<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:59.300> small<00:02:59.570> ours<00:02:59.920> so

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
turn all our RS into just small ours so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:14.560 
turn all our RS into just small ours so
I'll<00:03:01.310> show<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.550> what<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:01.940> mean<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.390> all

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
I'll show you what I mean so that is all

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.030 
I'll show you what I mean so that is all
the<00:03:14.690> parity<00:03:15.050> errors<00:03:15.459> thanks<00:03:16.459> for<00:03:16.640> watching
