00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.220
 namely draw and show older variants 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.330
 To raise Maximilian Staar 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 but give nothing away and increase it 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.359
 this means 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.599
 we take 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.909
 inconspicuous too 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.479
 You remember the rides on the cross rides between the two marchers 

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.589
 Ostinato lift right hand folded off strict 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.720
 now condense other artistic retreat 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 India will 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.580
 a march through IBM 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 its originally up to seven strictly off 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.500
 and that gives or Marshall 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 over the other stitch over it 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.220
 in the end an increase again 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.190
 So if we do not want to have less marchers, of course we have to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.700
 Seat height reduced mesh somewhere Hein again want 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.000
 At first we have to make people more and more beautiful 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 to take 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.210
 at the width of the streak piece does not change in this case 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.090
 Helier the mesh numbers do not change anything 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 increasingly light at the beginning 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.790
 Marschner does not know much about this on the right 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 and pull out one of the warrior's rides crossed right 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 last is also sometimes in a strange called a stitch right 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.720
 limited out 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.620
 and in the middle we take off again in the plant a march I per barrel 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.640
 Steinmeier voting right 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 ManCity good Neuschitzer use 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.580
 depending on which then death with dead use to plug together 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.640
 it changes a little this small can then she sets the tenant there 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.200
 there is still to evacuate 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.059
 finally more 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.309
 which probably will be more than keeps you know 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.659
 Two Strike Bieterrennen Maschinenbau that was it now 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.789
 in the mid 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.589
 Practices an Allan 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.589
 despite almost a bit like a suppository 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.779
 if you pull the mesh cloudy draws solid conclusion 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.870
 another variant 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.829
 1 meter wall march over Cher right 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.829
 stick out a stitch restricted to the right 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 that would bring stitches 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.419
 The grapes are reduced 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.540
 now we lift count Marschner strikes a stop are now Red i Hope 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.349
 to change 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.699
 about the knitted Marchionne 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.259
 also a variant 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.230
 could have found this 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.230
 Deutz assures he knew him hard 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.939
 That was clear at the same time 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.389
 you've already got something ingredients 11 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.499
 Learned to bring title by shot text 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.569
 then you should be able to do most applications to and after 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.569
 strict 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.709
 sda that Tiger already a bit the DEG 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.150
 five recites and it is very clear that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.490
 now it was stopped to take on the edges so not directly the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.569
 decreased 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.569
 how the stitches suddenly announce themselves 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 to take his leave 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.259
 Worry yet 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.150
 Yet another variation of the dwarven stitches stretches together a strict one 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
 and handing these knitted scepters together 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.150
 maybe it worked out now we are really all variants 2 3 against Beira 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 to harvest 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:19.059
 Sundermann and declines should now no longer feel like a recipe 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.059
 his 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.669
 if the ice is out of protest to see that these variants are also gone 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.479
 Result more or less distinct from each other
