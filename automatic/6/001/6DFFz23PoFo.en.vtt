00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.879
 [music] 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello everyone with you sports shop with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 Beeline and I whistling Arseny and today 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.949
 I will tell you about 1 echo from the past 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.170
 which was transmitted in 2013 because 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.880
 for the first time these sneakers you could see in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 2001 Meet nike before you today 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 zoom hyperfuse 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.540
 but first I want to thank for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 provided by a couple kidzone shop . 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.210
 ru from Yekaterinburg and in particular I dima 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.710
 I sin for help and also want 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 focus your attention on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 interesting site sneakers. no no where 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.800
 you can learn a lot of new and interesting 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.200
 about shoes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 all links you can find in the description to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.129
 this review 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.230
 and so soon may 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.899
 and so we decided to show the may beetle 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.420
 now because I think it is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.279
 iridescent 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.279
 iridescent colors many exactly 

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:11.810
 and it will remind him though of course hardly 

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:15.060
 designers associated with this insect 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.249
 no doubt the sneakers were considered alone 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.380
 of the prettiest at that moment when 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.779
 they actually came out a lot of bright 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.349
 colors that were visible from afar 

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:27.299
 and made everyone look at you 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:30.270
 nice design i'm personally a fan of the family 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 on zid and I like that there is 1 cast 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.609
 the material and here I just 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.999
 sympathize with them holistically and integrity 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.840
 although 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.490
 sneakers are not made of composite 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.359
 there is only one seam and now you 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.639
 show it from behind 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.709
 as you can see everything is here smoothly smoothly well 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.249
 can not add anything 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.239
 beautiful in one word but all this beauty 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.229
 crossed by their gaming qualities 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.569
 although 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.289
 the positive side and of course there is still 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.479
 Well, let's take it in order and first they 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.649
 quickly become unusable quickly 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.889
 bends appear 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.910
 Well, although this shoes and in my way and 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:13.100
 there must be something surprising 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 it is still considered that sneakers are not the best 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.780
 way fixes our foot pier 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 not enough of these side elements like 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.100
 to have on both sides here they are closer 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.720
 but although in a compartment with a hidden back they 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.140
 at least somehow provides this very 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.420
 fixation well and pivotal and powerful players 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.090
 this will be a little like the actual 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.330
 depreciation which is really there and no 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.980
 Well, though balon balloons zoom inside 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 there's the name of this 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.330
 technology you see that the sole itself 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.890
 imagine it all very subtle for feeling 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.360
 map 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.480
 inside there is still a fat one 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 insole but also here it is just not very 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.030
 soft can on the wave and lunarlon avoy 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.180
 mania sometime these sneakers are all 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 they will be mixed with them 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.800
 you can see the back as the waves 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.610
 present can say so they 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.440
 sag and so you see here are the notches 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.959
 present all this for more freedom 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 our movement that of course is not 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.860
 bad enough good all internal 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.290
 side 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.660
 stuffed with internal ones just 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.280
 opening sorry it is possible 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.959
 conclude that the ventilation is here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.640
 excellent this still contributes to the tongue but 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.209
 I'll show it to you now on the other. 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.209
 sneakers 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.570
 still you see that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.520
 the laces are put in such loops 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.680
 well, and the tongue itself you see thin 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.390
 but stuffing stuff after all 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.390
 present in the back of it for 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.459
 comfort let's now move on to 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.020
 outsole 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.660
 traction here is definitely excellent 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.900
 look look look at this powerful 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.420
 deep drawing you see it like this 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.340
 called herringbone 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.670
 I can even say that the wheels of a tractor 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.380
 Of course, in a good way, but still 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.380
 under the temple of his here resilience 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.680
 Now for the swoosh logo 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.370
 present in the nose area find that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.750
 written in tongue 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.520
 flight on the back and front on the sole and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.630
 here are five points under the heel 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.360
 in laces and here and not side return to 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.340
 designation of sneakers of the alpha family in 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.400
 that time it was thought sort of like even 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.919
 or add it myself to play 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.040
 of course now in these sneakers 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.680
 this is not the best option for the first time 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.150
 sneakers came out in 2001 and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.840
 technology can be said at that level 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.360
 there are now the same new models 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.330
 materials and technology of course gone 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.729
 far ahead I would recommend them 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.910
 connoisseurs and those who still just want 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.120
 effortlessly play with friends well 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.820
 and those who like me are positioned more 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.760
 them as an option for walking 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.820
 well, or for example in for walking after 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.010
 workouts sneakers are definitely one of 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.030
 the lightest are even by the present 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.570
 the standards on it all with you was sporty 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.200
