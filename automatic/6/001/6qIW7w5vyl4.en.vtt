00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.850

first<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:33.989> hesitant<00:00:34.320> because

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
first I was a little hesitant because

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
first I was a little hesitant because
they<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> website<00:00:36.180> based<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> China

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
they are a website based out of China

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
they are a website based out of China
and<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.579> worried<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and so I was a little worried that the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
and so I was a little worried that the
sizing<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.440> gonna<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.829> weird<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> some

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
sizing was gonna be weird and that some

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.979 
sizing was gonna be weird and that some
of<00:00:41.820> their<00:00:41.940> things<00:00:42.149> weren't<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> fit<00:00:42.809> me

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
of their things weren't going to fit me

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.260 
of their things weren't going to fit me
because<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.800> China<00:00:44.130> sizes<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
because I know China sizes are a little

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.020 
because I know China sizes are a little
bit<00:00:45.480> smaller<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:46.020> sizes<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> US<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
bit smaller than sizes in the US and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.010 
bit smaller than sizes in the US and
some<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.390> things<00:00:48.629> were<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
some other things were like a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.530 
some other things were like a
one-size-fits-all<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> deal<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.149> was

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
one-size-fits-all kind of deal and I was

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.500 
one-size-fits-all kind of deal and I was
a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.960> worried<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.760> say<00:00:53.789> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
something but I have to admit this is

made there aren't any like loose threads

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.480 
made there aren't any like loose threads
or<00:02:20.700> any<00:02:20.910> rips<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:21.750> anything<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.170> that

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.280 
is so soft and it's stretchy to which I
really<00:06:41.220> like<00:06:41.520> and<00:06:41.760> this<00:06:42.210> says<00:06:42.510> it<00:06:42.750> has<00:06:43.050> like

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
really like and this says it has like

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.180 
really like and this says it has like
heat<00:06:43.680> tech<00:06:44.630> so<00:06:45.630> it<00:06:45.780> absorbs<00:06:45.930> body<00:06:46.500> moisture

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
heat tech so it absorbs body moisture

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.180 
heat tech so it absorbs body moisture
and<00:06:47.460> it<00:06:48.330> actually<00:06:48.510> helps<00:06:49.230> you<00:06:49.470> generate<00:06:49.500> heat

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
and it actually helps you generate heat

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.540 
and it actually helps you generate heat
to<00:06:50.520> keep<00:06:50.760> you<00:06:50.970> warm<00:06:51.330> so<00:06:52.250> that's<00:06:53.250> pretty

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
to keep you warm so that's pretty

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.880 
to keep you warm so that's pretty
interesting<00:06:53.850> I<00:06:54.420> just<00:06:54.990> feel<00:06:55.470> like<00:06:55.500> you<00:06:55.710> can

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
interesting I just feel like you can

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.640 
interesting I just feel like you can
never<00:06:55.920> have<00:06:56.280> enough<00:06:56.610> basics<00:06:57.180> and<00:06:57.480> black<00:06:58.230> goes

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
never have enough basics and black goes

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.370 
never have enough basics and black goes
with<00:06:58.680> everything<00:06:58.950> so<00:06:59.730> and<00:07:00.270> then<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:01.110> last

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
with everything so and then the last

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.070 
with everything so and then the last
thing<00:07:01.620> i<00:07:01.920> got<00:07:01.950> is<00:07:02.220> actually<00:07:02.880> this<00:07:03.030> body<00:07:03.450> shaper

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
thing i got is actually this body shaper

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.790 
thing i got is actually this body shaper

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
so this is the back and then this is the

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.380 
so this is the back and then this is the
