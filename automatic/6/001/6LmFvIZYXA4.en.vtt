00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
not really helping cold the rut operates

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.669 
not really helping cold the rut operates
okay<00:00:29.359> or<00:00:30.359> decent<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.320> gets<00:00:31.439> hot

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
okay or decent and when it gets hot

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.569 
okay or decent and when it gets hot
though<00:00:32.149> then<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> starts<00:00:34.140> acting<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
though then it starts acting up and
