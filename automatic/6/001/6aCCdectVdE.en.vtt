here's good one for
independence<00:00:09.170> which<00:00:10.070> may<00:00:10.219> be<00:00:10.280> useful<00:00:10.519> if

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
independence which may be useful if

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.940 
independence which may be useful if
you're<00:00:10.969> playing<00:00:11.509> you<00:00:12.049> know<00:00:12.139> like<00:00:12.410> that<00:00:12.530> autumn

on the website you know if you're

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.580 
on the website you know if you're
playing<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.450> backing<00:00:17.840> just<00:00:18.050> want<00:00:18.169> the<00:00:18.259> melody

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
playing a backing just want the melody

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.279 
playing a backing just want the melody
to<00:00:18.710> sing<00:00:18.919> through<00:00:19.220> it<00:00:19.460> might<00:00:19.610> be<00:00:19.759> played<00:00:19.970> with

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
to sing through it might be played with

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.769 
to sing through it might be played with
a<00:00:21.289> finger<00:00:21.770> or<00:00:21.919> em<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.610> it's<00:00:23.150> kind<00:00:23.509> of<00:00:23.570> good<00:00:23.750> to

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
a finger or em and it's kind of good to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.109 
a finger or em and it's kind of good to
know<00:00:24.020> to<00:00:24.679> have<00:00:24.890> complete<00:00:25.279> control<00:00:25.310> over<00:00:26.000> each

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
know to have complete control over each

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.450 
know to have complete control over each
digits<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:26.750> I<00:00:26.960> found<00:00:27.349> this<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.920> I<00:00:28.009> still<00:00:28.189> find

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
digits so I found this and I still find

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.630 
digits so I found this and I still find
this<00:00:28.580> technique<00:00:29.420> really<00:00:29.810> useful<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:31.369> study

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
this technique really useful the study

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.090 
this technique really useful the study
actually<00:00:31.910> comes<00:00:32.059> from<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.330> Villalobos<00:00:33.100> study

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
actually comes from a Villalobos study

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.189 
actually comes from a Villalobos study
number<00:00:34.430> one<00:00:34.580> I<00:00:34.610> think<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.059> is<00:00:35.180> halfway<00:00:36.050> through

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
number one I think it is halfway through

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.600 
number one I think it is halfway through
the<00:00:36.440> piece<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.600> chord<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.870> there<00:00:39.610> it's

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
the piece this chord is there it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.660 
the piece this chord is there it's
fretted<00:00:40.969> I<00:00:42.250> think<00:00:43.250> there's<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.430> kind<00:00:43.550> of

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
fretted I think there's a kind of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.060 
fretted I think there's a kind of
diminished<00:00:44.030> shape<00:00:44.570> if<00:00:45.559> I<00:00:45.649> can<00:00:45.770> just<00:00:45.920> show<00:00:46.039> you

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
diminished shape if I can just show you

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.860 
diminished shape if I can just show you
what<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.789> second<00:00:47.360> finger<00:00:47.539> on<00:00:47.660> the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
what it is just a second finger on the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.150 
what it is just a second finger on the
fifth<00:00:48.170> string<00:00:48.399> 11th<00:00:49.399> fret<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.860> third

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
fifth string 11th fret and then a third

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.040 
fifth string 11th fret and then a third
finger<00:00:52.489> on<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.789> fourth<00:00:53.359> string<00:00:53.420> 12th<00:00:53.899> fret

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
finger on the fourth string 12th fret

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.459 
finger on the fourth string 12th fret
the<00:00:55.270> first<00:00:56.270> finger<00:00:56.629> on<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> third<00:00:57.199> string

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
the first finger on the third string

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.970 
the first finger on the third string
10th<00:00:57.949> fret<00:00:59.379> finger<00:01:00.379> on<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.680> second<00:01:00.949> string

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
10th fret finger on the second string

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.710 
10th fret finger on the second string
12th<00:01:01.579> fret

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.050 

so<00:01:06.560> once<00:01:06.740> you've<00:01:06.860> got<00:01:06.980> that<00:01:07.100> cord<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.880> right

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
so once you've got that cord the right

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.580 
so once you've got that cord the right
hand<00:01:08.330> fingering<00:01:08.690> is<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.110> I'll<00:01:09.350> play<00:01:09.530> it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
hand fingering is this I'll play it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.170 
hand fingering is this I'll play it
super<00:01:10.070> slow<00:01:10.190> so<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.610> can<00:01:10.760> see<00:01:10.940> what's<00:01:11.090> going

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
super slow so you can see what's going

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.750 
super slow so you can see what's going
on<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:12.710> starts<00:01:12.950> with<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.160> sixth<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.580> fourth

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
on it starts with the sixth and fourth

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.130 
on it starts with the sixth and fourth
strings<00:01:14.060> with<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.390> thumb<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:14.690> index<00:01:17.140> and

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
strings with the thumb and index and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.510 
strings with the thumb and index and
then<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.440> fifth<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.890> third<00:01:19.040> strings<00:01:19.340> with

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
then the fifth and third strings with

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920 
then the fifth and third strings with
thumb<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:19.850> index<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:22.820> thumb<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.480> middle

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
thumb and index and then thumb on middle

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.680 
thumb and index and then thumb on middle
on<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.530> fourth<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.920> second<00:01:25.220> strings<00:01:25.690> and

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
on the fourth and second strings and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.070 
on the fourth and second strings and
then<00:01:27.530> index<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.400> ring<00:01:28.580> finger<00:01:28.970> on<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.360> 3rd

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
then index and ring finger on the 3rd

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.860 
then index and ring finger on the 3rd
and<00:01:30.260> 1st<00:01:30.380> strings<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.320> sounds<00:01:33.560> like<00:01:33.710> this

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.170 

then<00:01:39.200> coming<00:01:39.500> back<00:01:39.530> down<00:01:39.820> every<00:01:40.820> second

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
then coming back down every second

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.210 
then coming back down every second
string<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.420> first<00:01:41.900> string<00:01:42.170> middle<00:01:42.620> finger<00:01:42.800> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
string to first string middle finger to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.620 
string to first string middle finger to
a<00:01:43.610> finger<00:01:44.860> then<00:01:45.860> third<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.250> second<00:01:46.790> string

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
a finger then third to second string

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.310 
a finger then third to second string
with<00:01:47.870> index<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.710> middle<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:51.020> thumb

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
with index and middle and then thumb

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.930 
with index and middle and then thumb
index<00:01:51.650> thumb<00:01:51.890> index<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.520> fourth<00:01:52.760> and

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
index thumb index on the fourth and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.490 
index thumb index on the fourth and
third

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100 

so<00:01:57.130> slow<00:01:57.490> down<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.030> fingering<00:01:58.510> is<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:58.870> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
so slow down the fingering is this and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:10.740 
so slow down the fingering is this and
it<00:01:59.440> has<00:01:59.620> to<00:01:59.800> be<00:02:00.070> this<00:02:00.250> fingering<00:02:00.610> exactly

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.600 

and<00:02:11.750> once<00:02:11.930> you've<00:02:12.080> memorized<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and once you've memorized that the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.000 
and once you've memorized that the
exercise<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.840> find<00:02:15.140> really<00:02:15.260> useful<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.800> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
exercise that I find really useful is to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.910 
exercise that I find really useful is to
play<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.300> thumb<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:17.720> loudly<00:02:17.960> as<00:02:18.290> possible<00:02:18.320> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
play the thumb as loudly as possible and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
play the thumb as loudly as possible and
the<00:02:19.220> three<00:02:19.550> fingers<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.540> quietly<00:02:20.990> as<00:02:21.140> possible

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
the three fingers as quietly as possible

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.640 
the three fingers as quietly as possible
so<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.770> sounds<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.040> this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.000 

and<00:02:30.489> then<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.720> next<00:02:31.870> exercise<00:02:32.170> would<00:02:32.590> be<00:02:32.739> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
and then the next exercise would be to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
and then the next exercise would be to
play<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.700> index<00:02:34.030> finger<00:02:34.269> as<00:02:34.330> loud<00:02:34.510> as<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.750> can

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.930

and then of course next exercise is the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.220 
and then of course next exercise is the
middle<00:02:45.330> finger

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.350 

and<00:02:53.230> then<00:02:53.380> finally<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.280> finger

once you have a go at those separately
you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.190> join<00:03:04.700> them<00:03:04.850> all<00:03:04.970> up<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.150> I'll<00:03:05.840> play<00:03:05.990> a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
you can join them all up so I'll play a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.840 
you can join them all up so I'll play a
version<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:06.590> where<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:06.830> play<00:03:07.070> each<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.580> maybe

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
version now where I play each one maybe

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.850 
version now where I play each one maybe
two<00:03:08.210> or<00:03:08.360> four<00:03:08.540> times<00:03:08.750> or<00:03:08.930> quite<00:03:09.110> quite

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
remember how it's going to go but I'll

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.780 
remember how it's going to go but I'll
try<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.960> join<00:03:12.110> them<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.010> thumb
