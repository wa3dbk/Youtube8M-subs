blocks<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.989> vein<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.710> professor<00:00:40.950> milk<00:00:41.430> let's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
blocks of vein I'm professor milk let's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.229 
blocks of vein I'm professor milk let's
get<00:00:42.210> started<00:00:42.710> first<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:44.100> go<00:00:44.520> over<00:00:44.730> why<00:00:44.879> some

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
get started first let's go over why some

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
get started first let's go over why some
people<00:00:45.420> play<00:00:45.930> Ving<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.680> reason<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.129> because

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
people play Ving one reason is because

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760 
people play Ving one reason is because
of<00:00:47.489> her<00:00:47.579> W<00:00:47.969> silver<00:00:48.420> volts<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.350> percent

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of her W silver volts it does percent

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
of her W silver volts it does percent
max<00:00:50.039> health<00:00:50.190> true<00:00:50.579> damage<00:00:50.969> every<00:00:51.329> three<00:00:51.629> autos

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
max health true damage every three autos

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
max health true damage every three autos
so<00:00:52.590> naturally<00:00:53.160> she<00:00:53.489> scales<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:53.940> attack<00:00:54.239> speed

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so naturally she scales off attack speed

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
so naturally she scales off attack speed
more<00:00:55.020> autos<00:00:55.469> more<00:00:56.010> true<00:00:56.250> damage<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.059> why

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
more autos more true damage which is why

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.319 
more autos more true damage which is why
you<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.079> run<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.550> 34.51<00:00:59.550> percent<00:01:00.090> attack

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you should run this 34.51 percent attack

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.080 
you should run this 34.51 percent attack
speed<00:01:00.570> runes<00:01:00.600> page<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.609> 426<00:01:02.609> zero<00:01:02.850> for
