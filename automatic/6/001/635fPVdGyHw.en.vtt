00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello now i will show you how 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.849
 You can remake the power supply for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.260
 emergency lamps remake it for their 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.100
 needs that is, this power supply has 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:24.570
 one minus it can not be included 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:28.109
 with a small load that is necessary there 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.360
 starts 9 and a half mpi load 111 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.850
 here accordingly one and a half mpi I here 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.629
 the price is about four 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 dollars it replaces this is 60 watts and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.649
 that's it this device this block 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 food he had mounted the circuit 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 tours 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:55.050
 but now only for him I will tell the scheme 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.350
 this power supply regulates my so 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 here's this transformer buy in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 the store can be remade as follows 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.589
 the way he initially goes in reverse 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 current coupling 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.320
 so it only runs current on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.290
 can redo make feedback 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.840
 by voltage 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 for this you need to find a small one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.540
 transformer how delicious 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.810
 diesel 2 big and small steward 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 in fact he was he manages these 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.869
 transistors find it about to circuit 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.600
 This little transformer is with him 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.049
 requires ki and this winding 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.909
 need to fix just solder 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.700
 small posting here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.409
 performed on the reverse side now block 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.539
 This power supply is bolted to the device as 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:02:00.329
 I could not show 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:02:02.250
 Here we take for Karacheva and here I draw 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.600
 should be looking at you that thus 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 way so then you need to take 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.840
 i wrapped another boat purple and 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.560
 here is one with her turns in a little ring 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 ferrite has passed and two turns through a large 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.099
 Here it is closed on the load 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 5 watt resistor I have 6 and 2 ohms 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.680
 power should be about 5 here and so 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.549
 I already experimented resistor this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.590
 Heats up and does not load this device 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:49.549
 for a long time that's why you need to register it to 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:55.109
 10 watts use resistance 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:58.730
 recommend on the Internet from 3 to 10 m here 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.730
 Well, I took 6 2 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.609
 proper and all thanks for 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.040
 Attention 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.579
 I hope so forgot to say one more 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.079
 The moment I worked here is another winding 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.319
 for power that's a voltmeter that is 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.680
 here 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.609
 one shot diodes 1 capacity 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.920
 what is the microfarad kingdom load 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.450
 code connects to this winding peacefully 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:36.569
 visible lacquered and it connects 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.790
 via schottky diodes 3 ampere that is 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.190
 I have a maximum power supply 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 two and a half there first he even 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.140
 When you instruct him to turn on two 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.930
 half 1 gives okay this next 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.570
 video will tell about it so that everyone 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.070
 Thank you for your attention. I hope the video will be 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.660
 helpful subscribe to the putta channel
