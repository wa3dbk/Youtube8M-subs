scoreboard but a lot of us wondered if

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.490 
scoreboard but a lot of us wondered if
there<00:00:08.820> might<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.240> letdown<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:10.080> feeling

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
there might be a letdown I was feeling

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.169 
there might be a letdown I was feeling
that<00:00:10.650> way<00:00:10.800> early<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.429> week<00:00:11.550> last<00:00:11.820> week<00:00:11.910> but

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
that way early in the week last week but

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.930 
that way early in the week last week but
I<00:00:12.240> talked<00:00:12.540> myself<00:00:12.750> into<00:00:13.500> feeling<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.460> Iowa

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I talked myself into feeling that Iowa

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.700 
I talked myself into feeling that Iowa
would<00:00:15.120> cover<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.450> twenty<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.049> point<00:00:16.350> spread

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
would cover that twenty one point spread

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.710 
would cover that twenty one point spread
based<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> heard<00:00:18.150> about<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.359> will

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
based on what I heard about I will

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
based on what I heard about I will
practice<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.230> better<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> week<00:00:19.890> they

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
practice you better in the week they

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
practice you better in the week they
started<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.789> very<00:00:20.820> fast<00:00:21.210> Ricky<00:00:21.570> Stanzi<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.140> was

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
started out very fast Ricky Stanzi I was

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590 
started out very fast Ricky Stanzi I was
five<00:00:22.949> fours<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.580> five<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:24.150> touchdown

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
five fours first five two touchdown

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
five fours first five two touchdown
passes<00:00:24.630> very<00:00:25.109> early<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.920> Iowa<00:00:26.640> was

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
passes very early on and Iowa was

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
passes very early on and Iowa was
definitely<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.510> business<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> dealing<00:00:28.650> early

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
definitely in business and dealing early

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
definitely in business and dealing early
but<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> will<00:00:30.119> may<00:00:30.390> look<00:00:30.539> back<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
but I think that I will may look back on

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
but I think that I will may look back on
this<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.260> feel<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:32.040> went<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this and feel like they went to the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.010 
this and feel like they went to the
running<00:00:32.820> game<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> set<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.480> their<00:00:33.600> play<00:00:33.780> action

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
running game to set up their play action

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
running game to set up their play action
game<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.620> normally<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.760> Big<00:00:36.000> Ten

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
game which they normally do in Big Ten

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.490 
game which they normally do in Big Ten
football<00:00:36.390> games<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
football games don't know that they

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
football games don't know that they
needed<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> particular

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
needed to do that in this particular

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
needed to do that in this particular
game<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.960> Arkansas<00:00:40.500> states<00:00:40.920> pass

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
game because Arkansas states pass

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.459 
game because Arkansas states pass
defense<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.910> isn't<00:00:42.420> very<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.440> think

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
defense just isn't very good and I think

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.930 
defense just isn't very good and I think
Iowa<00:00:43.950> would<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.219> had<00:00:44.370> their<00:00:44.520> way<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.670> them

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Iowa would have had their way with them

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.619 
Iowa would have had their way with them

offense<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.030> beginning<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> remind<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
offense is beginning to remind me of a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
offense is beginning to remind me of a
2003<00:01:01.829> type<00:01:02.039> season<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.489> offense<00:01:02.789> averaged

24 points 75 points per game in Big Ten
play<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.970> defense<00:01:06.180> gave<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.600> 22<00:01:07.080> points<00:01:07.380> per

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
play the defense gave up 22 points per

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.020 
play the defense gave up 22 points per
game<00:01:07.560> let<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.100> year<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.400> Big<00:01:08.549> Ten<00:01:08.729> play<00:01:08.880> which

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
game let that year in Big Ten play which

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
game let that year in Big Ten play which
was<00:01:09.150> somewhat<00:01:09.450> surprising<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.470> me<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
was somewhat surprising to me but that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.710 
was somewhat surprising to me but that
was<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.369> top<00:01:11.490> 15<00:01:11.880> scoring<00:01:12.240> defenses

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
was one of the top 15 scoring defenses

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
was one of the top 15 scoring defenses
in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.869> country<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.350> year<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
in the country that year I think this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
in the country that year I think this
year's<00:01:14.310> defense<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> better<00:01:15.119> than<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> 2003

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
year's defense is better than the 2003

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.300 
year's defense is better than the 2003
defense<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.680> definitely<00:01:16.950> more

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
defense it's definitely more

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
defense it's definitely more
