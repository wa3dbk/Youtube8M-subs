 atelier vor.foto immerse in a new 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.860

 photography so what am i doing? 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 to get such photos do not show it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.720
 so that, for example, is a mermaid 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 It looks really good that time 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.090
 By the way, this comes now on this 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.610
 fiftieth birthday so slow and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.649
 yes, to get something like that, too 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 according relaxed out there to see 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 There are a few tricks and tips that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 I can give for a successful one 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 underwater model shooting the first and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.750
 it's the most important thing you're after 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.309
 value is a perfect 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.869
 waterproof makeup that I wear 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 accordingly with the profi 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.890
 you do not want all of them 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.240
 look like watery whites yes im 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 next tatort that wants of course 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.450
 nobody and if you are natural 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 Uncoated in the water goes in then 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 you can see afterwards is anyway 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 everything is blue then the make-up would be 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.680
 also run and that can not in the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.790
 be the sense of the inventor that one there 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 looks accordingly why a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 water-corpse 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 Of course that's one thing 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 point then the next point is easy 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 the relaxed look yes do that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.110
 we just completely easy that was whole 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 relaxed just go down 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 exhale come down so completely here 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 exhale because if you are up here 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.830
 then you do not come down you see 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.659
 then almost like a balloon like that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.729
 why a buoy over water 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.520
 and if you stop here then the air 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.530
 you have the whole lung full of yes here 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.490
 full of air and you can not handle that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.189
 The next point is easy 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.920
 eyes open under water 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.570
 relaxed look let air out therefore 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 that's very important, yes, but I do 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 yes no pause baking because it looks yes 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.470
 also nothing so if you are the air 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.209
 stop so yes because it will not do that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.769
 It does not do that, it has to be quite 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.920
 looking relaxed we'll get that 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.990
 everything 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 the next point is accordingly 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.010
 Just keep calm and then have 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
 We are weightless 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.800
 weightless the completely different pictures 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.349
 allows pictures in the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.170
 weightless hair that billow 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.610
 These are very fascinating photos 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 The result is a complete one 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.239
 relaxed face and that's what makes it 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 also really much fun 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.300
 such a underwater photo shoot the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.920
 dresses so I can give the tip 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.720
 always takes art fiber because 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 cotton fibers sucks people 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 a shamrock how such a wet 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.209
 Of course , potato sack is also nice 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 if it somehow so sticks so why 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.650
 nasa potato sack is not synonymous 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 helped as mentioned synthetic fiber 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.239
 this fabric next to it is not 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.040
 fully absorbed by the color as it takes 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.140
 bright colors so red orange yellow 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.299
 Pink also goes pinka blue parts had 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.489
 watch out 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.380
 but in principle, of course 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.549
 the more brilliant the colors the better 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.530
 the whole because then, of course 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.810
 corresponding contrast so have my 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.790
 favorite color is red then comes like that 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.359
 I always like gold and gold 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.530
 yes as I said my next costumes the 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.019
 I find it always very nice in 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.030
 yellow in green what is there so everything 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.209
 yellow, of course, the biggest contrast 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.890
 is the best you can do yes what 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.600
 Otherwise, as I said , we simply have 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.019
 a few seconds under water 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.880
 stay that time is there that the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.100
 hair billow in accordance 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.980
 can and we also have this reflection 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.989
 about water have the best photos 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.340
 actually arise so close to the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.650
 Water surface that means we need 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.750
 actually only up to here under water too 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.880
 go because then we up here this 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.660
 then we still have a reflection 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.519
 more hair and even better clothes and 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.859
 very whole floating effect is natural 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.390
 even more intense the deeper we go 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.989
 There are also water depths of 23 meters 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.549
 ranging and completely out there is 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.930
 of course then then can 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.700
 The dress will be a bit longer then 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.940
 But more comes out of the dress just this 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.120
 yes, this movement is this flowing fabric 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.050
 movement that is quite good 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.909
 basically from the water depth ago 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 it is even enough you can even have a pool 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.860
 go from 120 water depth that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.449
 not on perfect does not have to 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.389
 somehow now we go there in five 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.340
 meter deep or seven meters deep that 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.599
 Does not bring anything unless I'm there 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.720
 below something interesting that 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.819
 coral reefs or fracking part or how 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.550
 Whatever or some part there 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.229
 would look pretty awesome though 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.060
 As I said, we are talking about pool 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.979
 photography not yet open 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.280
 other waters are valid 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.379
 scales are a bit different 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.270
 But as I said pool photography enough 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.889
 That's perfect when we're in open 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.880
 Waters are so to speak to see 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.099
 I also have a shooting 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.550
 It was really great 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.409
 baggersee 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.120
 of course that's how it is because we're in 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.099
 our region have fresh water and the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.690
 view is of course the same as 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.949
 you actually do not see any jobs at all 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.780
 Almost with the camera with the 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.849
 face ran 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.319
 and there are so many little water lilies 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.199
 and such algae and there you have to 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.610
 really turn off the headset because that 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.780
 are so small creepers and the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.069
 come because then lie down in a rum 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.719
 So as always said do not always remember 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.129
 there just think of the picture that will 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.729
 just awesome the photographer of 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.099
 that does it 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.830
 he does that, yes, I have something 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:43.479
 otherwise eyes on relaxed 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.250
 look out air let out air 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.900
 very important a few seconds time 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.370
 give the hair to relax 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.289
 can span 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.279
 yes, you can already do that 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.289
 practice in the swimming pool and otherwise 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.719
 There is simply a great photo shoot 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.279
 I wish you a lot of fun and see you 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.560
 next blog or until the next 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.560
 video until then your steffi czerny
