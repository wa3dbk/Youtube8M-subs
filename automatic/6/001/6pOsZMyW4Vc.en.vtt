bored after my first look the game is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
bored after my first look the game is
very<00:00:28.470> slow<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.980> narrative<00:00:29.369> focused<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
very slow and narrative focused and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.640 
very slow and narrative focused and
while<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> bad<00:00:30.599> thing<00:00:30.900> i<00:00:31.140> think<00:00:31.199> i'm<00:00:31.500> just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
while not a bad thing i think i'm just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
speaking of biases let's get into the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190

ups and downs of the game as i always
say<00:00:37.320> i<00:00:37.530> feel<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.070> review<00:00:38.489> should<00:00:38.550> merely

understand and follow unfortunately it

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
understand and follow unfortunately it
lacks<00:01:02.280> controller<00:01:02.820> support<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
lacks controller support which is what I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
lacks controller support which is what I
prefer<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> play<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.040> even<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
prefer to play with but even then it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.830 
prefer to play with but even then it
wasn't<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:06.030> necessary<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
wasn't really necessary to have a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230 
wasn't really necessary to have a
gamepad<00:01:07.350> finally<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> certainly<00:01:08.850> has<00:01:09.090> an

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
gamepad finally it certainly has an

that really stand out and on that note I
want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> talk<00:01:27.900> about<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.259> negatives<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.799> feel

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
want to talk about some negatives I feel

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
want to talk about some negatives I feel
are<00:01:29.189> important<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.000> gameplay<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.420> very<00:01:30.570> slow

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
are important the gameplay is very slow

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
are important the gameplay is very slow
and<00:01:31.229> boring<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:32.250> may<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.790> bias<00:01:33.090> against

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and boring this may be my bias against

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.179 
and boring this may be my bias against
adventure<00:01:33.990> games<00:01:34.200> talking<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> could

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
adventure games talking but it could

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
adventure games talking but it could
have<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.430> least<00:01:35.460> used<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.299> sprint<00:01:36.659> option<00:01:36.840> or

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
have at least used a sprint option or

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.330 
have at least used a sprint option or
something<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.770> went<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> wrong<00:01:38.280> direction

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
something I went the wrong direction

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.870 
something I went the wrong direction
many<00:01:39.030> times<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.750> had<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> slowly<00:01:40.549> walk<00:01:41.549> back

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
many times and had to slowly walk back

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
many times and had to slowly walk back
to<00:01:42.119> where<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.299> needed<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> was

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to where I needed to go and it was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.740 
to where I needed to go and it was
driving<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.100> crazy<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.509> many

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
driving me crazy also there are many

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
driving me crazy also there are many
gameplay<00:01:46.200> elements<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.680> require<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
gameplay elements that require you to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.469 
gameplay elements that require you to
basically<00:01:47.399> figure<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.420> yourself

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically figure it out for yourself

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
basically figure it out for yourself
while<00:01:49.200> some<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.770> obvious<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.310> some

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
while some are pretty obvious and some

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
while some are pretty obvious and some
are<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.759> easy<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.390> ran<00:01:51.840> into<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> few<00:01:52.350> spots

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
are pretty easy I ran into a few spots

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
are pretty easy I ran into a few spots
that<00:01:52.829> were<00:01:52.950> confusing<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:53.880> two<00:01:53.909> areas

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that were confusing in one or two areas

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.850 
that were confusing in one or two areas
that<00:01:54.540> were<00:01:54.630> almost<00:01:54.750> completely<00:01:55.049> hidden

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that were almost completely hidden

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
that were almost completely hidden
despite<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> brightness<00:01:57.180> being<00:01:57.420> turned<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
despite the brightness being turned up a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
despite the brightness being turned up a
little<00:01:58.229> above<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> recommended<00:01:58.799> settings

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
little above the recommended settings

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
little above the recommended settings
finally<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.570> no<00:02:00.810> idea<00:02:00.960> why<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
finally I have no idea why but the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
finally I have no idea why but the
cutscenes<00:02:02.520> refused<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> play<00:02:03.210> above<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> very

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
cutscenes refused to play above a very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
cutscenes refused to play above a very
low<00:02:04.079> frame<00:02:04.469> rate<00:02:04.500> due<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.700> looked

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
low frame rate due to this they looked

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
low frame rate due to this they looked
very<00:02:06.240> choppy<00:02:06.649> considering<00:02:07.649> they're<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
very choppy considering they're the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.469 
very choppy considering they're the
first<00:02:08.129> thing<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> game<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.270> was

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
first thing you see in the game this was

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
first thing you see in the game this was
definitely<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:10.349> pudding<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.920> tried<00:02:11.190> playing

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
definitely off pudding I tried playing

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
definitely off pudding I tried playing
them<00:02:11.700> while<00:02:11.879> recording<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
them while recording and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
them while recording and
not<00:02:12.930> recording<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:14.099> different<00:02:14.220> graphic

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
not recording and on different graphic

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.369 
not recording and on different graphic
settings<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.599> look<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> same<00:02:16.080> every

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
settings and they look the same every

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.020 
settings and they look the same every
time<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:17.069> being<00:02:17.280> said<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> game<00:02:17.819> actually

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
time that being said the game actually

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
time that being said the game actually
does<00:02:18.420> run<00:02:18.810> pretty<00:02:18.840> smoothly<00:02:19.500> otherwise<00:02:20.250> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
does run pretty smoothly otherwise and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.430 
does run pretty smoothly otherwise and
even<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> lowest<00:02:21.840> setting<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> looks

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
even on the lowest setting it looks

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.259 
even on the lowest setting it looks
really<00:02:22.800> good<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.580> point<00:02:23.940> hopefully

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
really good so at this point hopefully

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.699 
really good so at this point hopefully
you've<00:02:24.540> come<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> conclusion<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.500> whether

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
you've come to the conclusion of whether
