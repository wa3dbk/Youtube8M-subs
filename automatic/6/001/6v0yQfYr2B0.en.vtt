00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 We see this is a very reduced 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.820
 bike the crowds very concentrated in the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.550
 front as it should be right for the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.220
 users the front very short and the rear 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.690
 very very very short and steep 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 that is the basic proportion 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.580
 absolutely aware 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 the highlight of course is that now 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.060
 the tail here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.820
 this is from the big aluminum block 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.190
 Milled from a piece and also that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.899
 Tail light here and do a lot 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.400
 nice unit with the tank medium 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.480
 pass through the chamber 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.110
 All is set up 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 and contrasts nicely with the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.200
 here are the total seconds 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.610
 s 1000 rr they are real too 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.050
 actually the little intimate ones behind 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.030
 Hidden one sees it on the second 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.870
 look this bike is already a new one 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.780
 Concept It is often like we say something 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.750
 Also important is a role 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.969
 The thing is synonymous one or the other 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.100
 We may possibly be in the element 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.540
 see future on a series bike but 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.399
 principle is something of course not 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 eligible and then it was not like that 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.780
 This combination is very nice because of it 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 always gives these these mutual 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.679
 fertilization of sodingen 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.859
 we find a lot of old fashion here 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.929
 the still very very typical around the 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.219
 Chronic appearance indicate the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.959
 are still consistent today 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.630
 So I think that's a very nice one 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.789
 combination we have here very much 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 many old motorcycles in the exhibition 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.929
 some very very nice motorcycles 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.119
 and I personally do that very much 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.689
 in this mutual fertilization here 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.090
 you can see many proportions 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.069
 have the details have the technical 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.469
 solutions have as even today 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.110
 are incredibly interesting and the one 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.789
 which you also like to pick up and 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.789
 may possibly continue to spin
