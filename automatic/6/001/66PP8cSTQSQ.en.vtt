00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.550 

now<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:30.930> see<00:05:31.260> where<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.470> saw<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.010> coming<00:05:32.280> from

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
now you see where I saw it coming from

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.120 
now you see where I saw it coming from
okay<00:05:35.570> so<00:05:36.570> we<00:05:36.690> just<00:05:36.840> have<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.050> plug<00:05:37.230> that<00:05:37.440> that's

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
okay so we just have to plug that that's

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.090 
okay so we just have to plug that that's
literally<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.580> for

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.230 

probably<00:05:44.100> that's<00:05:44.250> right<00:05:44.550> here<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.940> think

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
probably that's right here I think

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.809 
probably that's right here I think
well<00:05:46.780> I<00:05:46.810> don't<00:05:47.080> think<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.410> need<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:47.770> every<00:05:48.699> is

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
well I don't think I need that every is

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.100 
well I don't think I need that every is
gonna<00:05:48.940> attempt<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.360> pull<00:05:49.630> this<00:05:49.780> right<00:05:49.960> now

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
gonna attempt to pull this right now

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.820 
gonna attempt to pull this right now
purely<00:05:50.889> for<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.130> fact<00:05:51.160> to<00:05:52.090> see<00:05:52.330> if<00:05:53.289> it<00:05:53.620> breaks

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
purely for the fact to see if it breaks

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.379 
purely for the fact to see if it breaks
servers<00:05:54.310> survive<00:05:54.580> so<00:05:54.819> if<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.060> does<00:05:55.180> better

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
servers survive so if it does better

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.499 
servers survive so if it does better
work<00:05:55.720> if<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:56.080> survives<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:57.520> waiting<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.240> far

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
work if it survives and waiting that far

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.390 
work if it survives and waiting that far
then<00:05:58.840> we're<00:05:59.110> pretty<00:05:59.229> much<00:05:59.440> we're<00:05:59.949> gonna<00:06:00.009> spoil

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
then we're pretty much we're gonna spoil

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.860 
then we're pretty much we're gonna spoil
ourselves<00:06:01.800> well<00:06:02.880> now<00:06:03.880> is<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.090> time<00:06:04.180> to<00:06:04.750> be
