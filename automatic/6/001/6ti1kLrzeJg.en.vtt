better through lubrication excellence
today<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.740> will<00:00:14.280> talk<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.210> importance

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
today I will talk about the importance

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
today I will talk about the importance
of<00:00:15.900> implementing<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.830> world-class<00:00:17.310> oil

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
of implementing a world-class oil

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820 
of implementing a world-class oil
analysis<00:00:18.480> program<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.140> support<00:00:19.590> your

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
analysis program to support your

analysis program to support your
reliability<00:00:20.460> strategies<00:00:21.710> in<00:00:22.710> noria<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.369> use

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
reliability strategies in noria we use

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.330 
reliability strategies in noria we use
an<00:00:23.789> expression<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.420> says<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> only<00:00:26.160> your

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
an expression that says the only your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.560 
an expression that says the only your
machines<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> talking

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
machines is talking

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
machines is talking
are<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.140> hearing<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.880> answer<00:00:30.150> we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
are you hearing it the answer we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.840 
are you hearing it the answer we
normally<00:00:30.630> receive<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.260> yes<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.700> an

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
normally receive is yes we do have an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
normally receive is yes we do have an
oil<00:00:33.059> analysis<00:00:33.630> program<00:00:33.989> implemented<00:00:34.590> in

place and it has been working for years
that's<00:00:38.399> wonderful<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> second

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that's wonderful but there is a second

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.330 
that's wonderful but there is a second
question<00:00:42.020> are<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.260> hearing<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
question are you hearing all the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.790 
question are you hearing all the

valuable and all the useful information

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.479 
valuable and all the useful information
that<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.280> oil<00:00:47.579> wants<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> tell<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.489> probably

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that your oil wants to tell you probably

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.810 
that your oil wants to tell you probably
hear<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> answer<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.809> affirmative<00:00:52.820> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
hear the answer is not affirmative we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
hear the answer is not affirmative we
have<00:00:54.000> seen<00:00:54.180> many<00:00:54.570> programs<00:00:55.170> implemented<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
have seen many programs implemented in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
have seen many programs implemented in
the<00:00:56.100> field<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> best<00:00:57.510> desires<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the field with the best desires but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.580 
the field with the best desires but
limitations<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.719> perceived<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
limitations that are not perceived in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
limitations that are not perceived in
many<00:01:02.010> cases<00:01:02.520> by<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.850> pro<00:01:03.120> producer<00:01:03.300> let's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
many cases by the pro producer let's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
many cases by the pro producer let's
talk<00:01:04.439> about<00:01:04.559> how<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> implement<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.670> worthless

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
talk about how to implement a worthless

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.490 
talk about how to implement a worthless
oil<00:01:06.869> analysis<00:01:07.350> program<00:01:08.150> first<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
oil analysis program first we have to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.929 
oil analysis program first we have to
define<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.220> program<00:01:11.880> goals<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.810> objectives

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
define the program goals and objectives

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.890 
define the program goals and objectives
will<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> use<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.670> predictive<00:01:17.900> strategy

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
will we use it as a predictive strategy

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
will we use it as a predictive strategy
will<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.920> used<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.090> proactive

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
will be used only as a proactive

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
will be used only as a proactive
strategy<00:01:22.670> will<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.700> used<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.509> implemented<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
strategy will be used or implemented to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
strategy will be used or implemented to
maximize<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.330> oil<00:01:27.509> drain<00:01:27.780> intervals<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
maximize the oil drain intervals in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.100 
maximize the oil drain intervals in
machines<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.720> probably<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:30.960> be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
machines or probably would be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
machines or probably would be
interesting<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> implement<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.939> analyze

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
interesting to implement it to analyze

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
interesting to implement it to analyze
the<00:01:33.600> quality<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> verify<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> quality<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the quality and verify the quality of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
the quality and verify the quality of
the<00:01:35.460> incoming<00:01:35.790> oil<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.810> even<00:01:37.619> better<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the incoming oil or even better it can

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
the incoming oil or even better it can
be<00:01:39.810> implemented<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.979> those<00:01:41.490> objectives

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
be implemented with all those objectives

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.100 
be implemented with all those objectives
which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.710> best<00:01:44.009> practice<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> second

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
which is the best practice the second

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770 
which is the best practice the second
step<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:47.030> implementing<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.360> designed

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
step is implementing what was designed

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.920 
step is implementing what was designed
that<00:01:49.740> means<00:01:50.180> installing<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.479> sampling

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that means installing the right sampling

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.770 
that means installing the right sampling
ports<00:01:52.880> using<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> right<00:01:54.210> sampling
