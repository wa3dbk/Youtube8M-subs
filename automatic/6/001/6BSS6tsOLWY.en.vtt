00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.950
 entered 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.800
 we didn't get stuck or leaning on any basic player 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.200
 close to the lead 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.650

 expression such as her and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.060
 johan sandwich anyway 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 and they run in different directions 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.780
 to celebrate 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.780

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.100
 knocked there at Sheridan 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.860
 this dome that sometimes has such a ruytinx 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.630
 then the ball comes 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 We make it our first rescue is one 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.840
 top model 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.230
 sit quietly 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.230
 I also had a child 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 in addition to adding four riders from 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 this season 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 good ball from karel geraerts 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.650
 to get rid of him here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.760
 let that tone cornelize away 4 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.220
 small hour 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.890
 you have to do as a striker 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.320
 makes a foot in parts second for 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.320

 the first of the competition 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.970
 thibaut van acker my first 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.510
 you just say it is a violation 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 Postal Code 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.300
 cornelis a good hair a header from 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.400
 too swollen the first pole will be it 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.790
 most dangerous of circle in this one 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 contest 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.980
 of the self resources 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.840
 then listen along the sea above 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.980
 Heads away as they take them farther away 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.680
 by providing them in a reasonable way that you can 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.799
 life 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.799
 So 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.190
 some don't do that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.989

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.459

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.760

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.370
 Achieve more than it gives 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.810

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.240
 it's tune 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.040
 I just had it again 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.810
 after three minutes in the second half 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.510

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.290
 lulled look another very nice afternoon 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.280
 words for 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.859
 and let my studies run and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.290
 continue my bandalovski and then you can 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.770
 they give 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.770
 something for that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.710
 kostovski who just can't line up with it 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.210
 centering but door out is 90 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.770
 an accident happened 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.349
 we mainly had to bet at the bottom 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.599
 of course not 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.990
 rating together at five minutes for it 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.400
 end comes what they want so badly 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.690

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.520

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.340
 a tight or asia than in vivo 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.409

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.349
 minutes from the end locations 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.399
 from in that their riders 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.399

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.490
 to grab 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.490
 now she had to stay at 3 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.920
 then shop them a lot 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.920
