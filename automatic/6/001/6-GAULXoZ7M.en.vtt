00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.380 
budget and stick to it that that's
probably<00:03:02.579> been<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.850> biggest<00:03:02.940> thing<00:03:03.359> that

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
probably been the biggest thing that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.120 
probably been the biggest thing that
