00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
because it's so funny it really is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
because it's so funny it really is
people<00:02:14.459> say<00:02:14.700> they're<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> quit<00:02:15.360> runescape

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
people say they're like quit runescape

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 
people say they're like quit runescape

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and then you see them right back on

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.199 
and then you see them right back on
runescape<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:19.170> people<00:02:19.799> only<00:02:20.370> would

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
runescape you see if people only would

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.470 
runescape you see if people only would
say<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.400> taking<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.610> break

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.900 
say I'm taking a break
rather<00:02:24.959> than<00:02:25.260> quitting<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:26.010> quitting<00:02:26.700> is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
rather than quitting because quitting is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.449 
rather than quitting because quitting is
such<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> hard<00:02:27.660> word<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.190> for

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
such a hard word it really is like for

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.880

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
trudged she's been trying to quit for

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
trudged she's been trying to quit for
like<00:02:40.590> ten<00:02:41.160> years

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
like ten years

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
runescape that give away their bank

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.370 
runescape that give away their bank
because<00:03:14.700> they<00:03:14.880> say<00:03:15.150> they're<00:03:15.510> quitting<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
because they say they're quitting and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.620 
because they say they're quitting and
then<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:17.040> day<00:03:17.310> later<00:03:17.609> they<00:03:17.880> log<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.389> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
then a day later they log on to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.759 
then a day later they log on to
runescape<00:03:20.030> yeah<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.750> was<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> very<00:03:22.169> bad<00:03:22.410> move

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
runescape yeah that was a very bad move

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.039 
runescape yeah that was a very bad move
now<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.190> friend<00:03:23.579> he<00:03:24.389> didn't<00:03:24.630> give<00:03:24.750> away<00:03:24.870> his

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
now my friend he didn't give away his

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:25.490 
now my friend he didn't give away his
bank

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
bank

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.199 
bank
I<00:03:25.590> think<00:03:25.829> his<00:03:25.950> bank<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> only<00:03:26.489> worth<00:03:26.760> probably

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
I think his bank is only worth probably

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.420 
I think his bank is only worth probably
like<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.359> hundred<00:03:27.480> mil<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.680> still<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.250> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
like a hundred mil but still that's a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.080 
like a hundred mil but still that's a
hundred<00:03:29.639> mil<00:03:30.000> given<00:03:30.540> away<00:03:30.780> um<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.370> mean<00:03:32.700> a
