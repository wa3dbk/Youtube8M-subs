00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:14.230
 well said that it is well served at all 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.850
 and all I hope you have 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.919
 anyway me it's going great we get 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.070
 do it for the presentation of a 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.220
 private deer we have kept vague for 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.560
 weeks 5th place on grass gp12 on 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.449
 staff world blood mainly a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.269
 jousting at and hadwin steenwerck 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.360
 React to the eye I joined salary 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.800
 for two or three days I'm here I 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.560
 think it's really good 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.200
 brain has 500 seats 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.910
 without bug, that is to say that there can 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.980
 have 500 Senate players without them 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.870
 have no bug 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.130
 there was a lot of updating during 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.540
 two changes on a server 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.750
 creating new lines 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.550
 creating new maps too 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 radical change 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 two stiti breasts so for example if we 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 goes to his city for his ceramics on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 the TV on the protractor ended on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 will notice that it was totally 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 modified then hop 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 so that's so it's done it's a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 place to a mixture between clarisse and one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.800
 will make them one each as bio and 100 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.509
 city ​​so silence worth tax on the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.670
 map so had already I forgot to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.670
 tell you that it poured a pvp server and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.049
 pvm 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.020
 so no bug and way if they get to 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.780
 houtain people is that there is a scene and 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.990
 every thing and sauvadet at the same time 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.289
 so already short so go fashion 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.080
 ketchup vetch station so honorable 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.810
 xt2 is 400 penny afoula uniting and at 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.740
 the drug is 4 ie it's 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.330
 not too hard 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.600
 knowing that he is a puncher 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:59.030
 in short it admits of its vault paid then 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.159
 ball exchanges to the allies max theret 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.630
 so in terms of discovering it from 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.440
 new maps we find ourselves all from 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.450
 then all of you see you turn 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.709
 sorry if you see that it's nice that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.030
 very little it has nothing to do with 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.620
 this wine it's just that I was 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.000
 recorded that I was trying 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.290
 to register with the software and the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.569
 I have a little bit 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.930
 difficulties with the server since my 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.549
 pc league 1 can so where courses 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.260
 simply the four portals that 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.269
 allow you to teleport to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.340
 various places so here I am going to 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.330
 show right away second portal 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.400
 or what can take us after 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.930
 well I will show for the first so 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 second portal takes you to a 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.320
 island event that is to say that we have 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.239
 many obstacles to do so well 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.370
 sure it's not limit 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.799
 and if you get there in the event soul 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.690
 you can win a lot of 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.790
 things but for now I 'm in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.269
 was pretty far but I had 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.269
 galley 1 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.900
 so that's for hellens of course 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.540
 animations and so after for our 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 own site and the first portal that's 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.099
 the same thing is an event island so 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.200
 that's all for all that's all 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:15.660
 which also avoids so it can serve 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.910
 for animators for teachers of 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.190
 game for example if you have a problem 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.630
 or others could ttp here like this 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.430
 you have restored 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.030
 rule so we confess united what was 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.740
 created to have calm for their den 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.400
 in the hands of the game masters 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.160
 and players after another game system 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.480
 was created the system of tokens that 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.680
 is to have chips 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.180
 on furniture and to be able to exchange them 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800
 against various things as you see 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.690
 right here 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.220
 so it can be anything 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.220
 any item any 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 parchment and of course to have for 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.970
 to have the chips as I said it must 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.760
 kill monsters and so here I go 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.550
 be tp directly to the area te 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.290
 allows to have the chips so by 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.010
 example there you have to go to the caretaker 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.430
 the tour click and send it us 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.340
 direct in a kind of garden that 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.750
 allows you to kill asura or so 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.090
 another of other modes so I have 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.739
 completely forgot the name so that you 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.699
 gives tokens and the more you have to 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.620
 so let's not just throw that away 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.090
 allow xp but in addition to having 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.370
 so let's toss more to the east of the games in 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.050
 plus you will have a gift of gifts from 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.759
 size so I'm really sorry 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.620
 it's being beugin but it's good 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.120
 really the fault the symbol lost any 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.919
 way I think I was we were 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.110
 than three on it so it was evening 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.330
 it was closed so 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.080
 so here is a system of tokens there 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.479
 was a small exclusivity of sart which 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.130
 which allows you to advance a lot on 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.419
 his feet theme for example if I'm 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.639
 had not closed if you do not have 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.599
 to affirm a thing of shoes or other 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.220
 so that can help something anything 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.050
 after that there was hatred that was 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.849
 totally changed so here I had them 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.349
 asked to integrate outside like that I 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.720
 shows you at the entrance simply 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.150
 debaghine the queen that was done in 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.760
 two and a half hours good I find 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.620
 surely not bad as some who has been 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.070
 totally modified and created by the staff 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.070
 the server 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.090
 so I'm not showing you back August 2 to 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.250
 open so that's me short 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.080
 so we go back through the entrance into 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.240
 the arena and you'll see that it's 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.820
 really a beautiful arena with pang 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.640
 merchant merchant of the queen so if 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.660
 you can but sell food 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.220
 that it was that you look at it and the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.340
 queen she was totally redone so 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.170

 really not bad it's very very beautiful 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.330
 there are many other exclusives to do 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.160
 in any case I hope that the server you 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.600
