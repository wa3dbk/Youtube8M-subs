00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:53.120 

you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:00.080 

I<00:00:57.860> think<00:00:58.860> there's<00:00:59.040> one<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.490> that<00:00:59.550> speaks<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
I think there's one thing that speaks to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.830 
I think there's one thing that speaks to
me

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
me

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.390 
me
so<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.620> Hong<00:01:02.800> Kong<00:01:02.830> man<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.940> no<00:01:04.120> space<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
so the Hong Kong man the no space so

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300 
so the Hong Kong man the no space so
like<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.120> plan<00:01:07.330> would<00:01:07.450> be<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.630> go<00:01:07.990> land<00:01:08.980> at<00:01:09.220> the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
like the plan would be to go land at the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.920 
like the plan would be to go land at the
bottom<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:10.270> then<00:01:10.420> there's<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.870> whole

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
bottom and then there's that whole

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.130 
bottom and then there's that whole
treatment<00:01:11.650> now<00:01:11.950> along<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.730> ice<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.270> think<00:01:13.990> that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
treatment now along the ice I think that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.540 
treatment now along the ice I think that
looks<00:01:14.380> pretty<00:01:14.530> cool<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.070> then<00:01:15.250> there<00:01:15.460> would

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
looks pretty cool and then there would

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.060 
looks pretty cool and then there would
be<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.880> potential<00:01:16.300> eye<00:01:16.780> straight<00:01:17.560> line<00:01:17.800> at<00:01:17.980> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
be a potential eye straight line at the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.930 
be a potential eye straight line at the
bottom<00:01:18.340> as<00:01:18.460> well

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
bottom as well

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.350 
bottom as well
I<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.920> almost<00:01:21.190> right<00:01:21.520> about<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> few<00:01:21.910> days<00:01:22.150> ago

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
I was almost right about a few days ago

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
I was almost right about a few days ago
we<00:01:23.110> scoped<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.160> from<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.850> from<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.240> plane<00:01:25.510> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we scoped it from the from a plane and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.800 
we scoped it from the from a plane and
and<00:01:27.580> they're<00:01:27.760> basically<00:01:28.150> there's<00:01:28.390> been<00:01:28.570> huge

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
and they're basically there's been huge

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.940 
and they're basically there's been huge
south<00:01:29.590> wind<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.960> was<00:01:32.080> just<00:01:32.260> ice<00:01:32.530> over

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
south wind and there was just ice over

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.730 
south wind and there was just ice over
the<00:01:33.220> place<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.810> gonna<00:01:34.990> stop<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.380> little

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the place this is gonna stop a little

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.550 
the place this is gonna stop a little
earlier<00:01:36.100> than<00:01:36.340> planned<00:01:38.010> because<00:01:40.410> not<00:01:41.410> that

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
earlier than planned because not that

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.260 
earlier than planned because not that
much<00:01:41.770> snow<00:01:41.920> even<00:01:42.310> if<00:01:42.460> it's<00:01:42.640> been<00:01:42.820> windblown

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
much snow even if it's been windblown

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.480 
much snow even if it's been windblown
and<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:43.900> carries<00:01:44.229> pretty<00:01:44.470> well<00:01:44.650> it's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and it carries pretty well it's

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.600 
and it carries pretty well it's
basically<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:46.119> enough<00:01:47.070> yeah<00:01:48.070> there<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.340> can

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
basically not enough yeah there you can

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.540 
basically not enough yeah there you can
have<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.900> pretty<00:01:49.900> good<00:01:50.110> idea<00:01:50.410> there's<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.190> little

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
have a pretty good idea there's a little

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.530 
have a pretty good idea there's a little
bit<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:52.560> fresh<00:01:53.560> fresh<00:01:54.340> no<00:01:54.700> like<00:01:55.150> pretty<00:01:55.450> much

to Russia broke my binding after landing
this<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.530> jump<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:42.800> landed<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.950> big<00:02:44.190> cliff<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.880> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
this one jump I landed a big cliff on a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
this one jump I landed a big cliff on a
rock<00:02:45.240> last<00:02:45.780> week<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.230> feeble<00:02:46.470> burn<00:02:46.740> on<00:02:46.950> the

basically<00:02:49.770> lost<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.370> option<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.790> winning<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
basically lost the option of winning the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.000 
basically lost the option of winning the
title<00:02:52.910> when<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.240> fun<00:02:54.570> when<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.050> feel<00:02:55.500> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
title when I have fun when I feel that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.230 
title when I have fun when I feel that
I'm<00:02:56.850> living<00:02:57.209> epic<00:02:58.050> things<00:02:58.290> epic<00:02:58.709> moments

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
I'm living epic things epic moments

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.150 
I'm living epic things epic moments
usually<00:03:00.240> behind<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> work<00:03:01.140> gets<00:03:01.680> done<00:03:01.800> by

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
usually behind it the work gets done by

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.360 
usually behind it the work gets done by
itself<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:04.200> year<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.800> opposite

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
itself and this year it's the opposite

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
itself and this year it's the opposite
I<00:03:05.550> guess<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.240> missing<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.810> feeling<00:03:07.260> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
I guess I'm missing that feeling of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.730 
I guess I'm missing that feeling of
doing<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:08.330> line<00:03:09.330> with<00:03:09.630> perfect<00:03:10.170> conditions

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
doing a line with perfect conditions

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.240 
doing a line with perfect conditions
arriving<00:03:11.280> at<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> bottom<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.060> get<00:03:12.900> this

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
arriving at the bottom and get this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.920 
arriving at the bottom and get this
really<00:03:14.250> incredible<00:03:14.790> feeling<00:03:15.000> that's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
really incredible feeling that's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.510 
really incredible feeling that's
basically<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.530> reason<00:03:16.560> why<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.160> no<00:03:17.310> word

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
basically the reason why it's no word

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:40.720 
basically the reason why it's no word

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
just a clean takeoff it was basically a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.180 
just a clean takeoff it was basically a
big<00:03:51.140> offensive<00:03:52.140> rocks<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.650> had<00:03:52.800> all<00:03:53.040> you

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
over and that made it a bit tricky but

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
over and that made it a bit tricky but
uh<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:56.730> worked<00:03:56.940> well

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.360
