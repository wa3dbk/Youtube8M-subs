earth has its own president Gohan wants
another<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.789> crap<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> Chi<00:00:50.039> Chi<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.280> better

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
another I crap but Chi Chi is better

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.479 
another I crap but Chi Chi is better
than<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> blah<00:00:51.690> blah<00:00:51.870> blah<00:00:52.100> note<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> math

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
than he is blah blah blah note that math

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.810 
than he is blah blah blah note that math
book<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:53.850> become<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> singular<00:00:54.660> word<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
book has become a singular word now I

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
book has become a singular word now I
think<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.090> due<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> limitations<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.350> item

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
think that's due to limitations on item

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.560 
think that's due to limitations on item
names<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.340> yes<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> journal<00:01:00.270> now

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
names but yes we have a journal now

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
names but yes we have a journal now
which<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.020> kid<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.739> keeps<00:01:02.039> control

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
which actually kid which keeps control

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
which actually kid which keeps control
of<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.789> quests<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.449> stuff<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.870> it's

actually<00:01:04.049> useful<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:05.729> here's<00:01:05.909> our<00:01:06.060> status

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
actually useful but here's our status

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually useful but here's our status
screen<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> little

items we can make the text even faster

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
items we can make the text even faster
if<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.500> wanted<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.390> here's<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> journal

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
our quest is to find the math book so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
our quest is to find the math book so
let's<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.900> find<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> math<00:01:22.409> book<00:01:23.150> because

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
let's go find the math book because

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.609 
let's go find the math book because
apparently<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> find<00:01:25.439> that

apparently we really need to find that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
apparently we really need to find that
damn<00:01:25.799> math<00:01:26.070> book<00:01:26.310> luckily<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.659> easy

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
damn math book luckily it's really easy

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.960 
damn math book luckily it's really easy
to<00:01:27.930> find<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:29.970> happens<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
to find it just so happens to be up here

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
to find it just so happens to be up here
yes<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.900> pick<00:01:34.079> things<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
yes we actually can pick things up I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
yes we actually can pick things up I
know<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> novel<00:01:36.060> concept<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:39.000> hold<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know what a novel concept we hold it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.910 
know what a novel concept we hold it
over<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:39.630> head<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.990> link<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.380> fashion

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
over our head and a link like fashion

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319 
over our head and a link like fashion
and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.159> take<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.520> downstairs<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and then take it back downstairs to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.109 
and then take it back downstairs to
study<00:01:42.829> because<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:44.549> who<00:01:44.850> are

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
study because that's what people who are

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.889 
study because that's what people who are
good<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> students<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.299> for<00:01:48.299> instance<00:01:48.479> only

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
good the students do I for instance only

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.440 
good the students do I for instance only
studied<00:01:49.200> once<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:49.649> entire<00:01:49.770> life<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.549> then

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
studied once in my entire life and then

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.730 
studied once in my entire life and then
realized<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:51.960> stupid<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:54.530> go<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
realized it was stupid and go on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
realized it was stupid and go on
realizes<00:01:56.219> stupid<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.909> promptly<00:01:57.149> goes<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
realizes stupid to and promptly goes to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.890 
realizes stupid to and promptly goes to
sleep<00:01:58.520> so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.110 

when<00:02:02.500> he<00:02:02.560> wakes<00:02:02.770> off<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.160> window<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.550> open<00:02:03.910> for

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
when he wakes off the window is open for

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.730 
when he wakes off the window is open for
some<00:02:04.330> reason<00:02:05.370> but<00:02:07.200> we're<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.470> use<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.710> to

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
some reason but we're going to use it to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.620 
some reason but we're going to use it to
escape<00:02:09.160> because<00:02:09.550> that's<00:02:09.850> what<00:02:10.030> good<00:02:10.240> children

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
escape because that's what good children

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.530 
escape because that's what good children

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.659 
going to blow them up with key blasts
instead<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:27.630> takes<00:04:28.630> us<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.900> level<00:04:29.110> two

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
instead and that takes us to level two

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.650 
instead and that takes us to level two
now<00:04:30.669> we<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> go<00:04:31.030> through<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.270> other<00:04:31.419> gate

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
now we can go through that other gate

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.930 
now we can go through that other gate
and<00:04:32.500> also<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:32.979> gain<00:04:33.160> attributes<00:04:33.669> because<00:04:33.850> you

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
and also we gain attributes because you

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.219 
and also we gain attributes because you
actually<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.360> attributes<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:34.930> mean
