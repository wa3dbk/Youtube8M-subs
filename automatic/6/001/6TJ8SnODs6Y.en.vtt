00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
of the arrow I'd quit doing that I

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
away that's perfectly safe for him and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.160 
away that's perfectly safe for him and
as<00:00:39.079> slide<00:00:39.440> takes<00:00:40.069> care<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.339> that<00:00:40.519> for<00:00:40.760> me<00:00:41.170> I

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
as slide takes care of that for me I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.470 
as slide takes care of that for me I
struggled<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.100> lot<00:00:43.280> when<00:00:43.670> I<00:00:43.699> first<00:00:44.059> started

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
struggled a lot when I first started

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.500 
struggled a lot when I first started
using<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:44.929> in<00:00:45.350> fact<00:00:45.679> even<00:00:46.550> being<00:00:46.699> on<00:00:46.879> AMS<00:00:47.329> is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
using this in fact even being on AMS is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.689 
using this in fact even being on AMS is
Prostaff<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:48.319> struggled<00:00:49.219> with<00:00:49.280> learning<00:00:49.670> how

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
Prostaff I struggled with learning how

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.069 
Prostaff I struggled with learning how
to<00:00:49.789> tie<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.120> knot<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.539> I<00:00:50.600> kind<00:00:50.839> of<00:00:50.899> invented

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
to tie the knot and I kind of invented

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.129 
to tie the knot and I kind of invented
my<00:00:51.409> own<00:00:51.559> way<00:00:51.769> of<00:00:51.800> doing<00:00:52.039> it<00:00:52.389> and<00:00:53.389> it<00:00:53.809> was<00:00:53.929> pretty

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
my own way of doing it and it was pretty

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.110 
my own way of doing it and it was pretty
difficult<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.859> really<00:00:54.979> hard<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.399> teach<00:00:55.609> but

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
difficult and really hard to teach but

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.239 
difficult and really hard to teach but
now<00:00:56.269> Ron<00:00:56.809> Skirvin<00:00:57.229> had<00:00:57.319> taken<00:00:57.499> some<00:00:57.739> time<00:00:57.769> and

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
now Ron Skirvin had taken some time and

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.309 
now Ron Skirvin had taken some time and
he<00:00:58.999> really<00:00:59.269> showed<00:00:59.449> me<00:00:59.479> how<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.690> do<00:00:59.899> this<00:01:00.049> and

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
he really showed me how to do this and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.629 
he really showed me how to do this and
it's<00:01:00.440> really<00:01:00.649> easy<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.219> I'm<00:01:01.339> gonna<00:01:01.460> show<00:01:01.579> you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
want to do is you're going to get your

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.830 
want to do is you're going to get your
line<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.730> straight<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.570> we're<00:01:11.720> going

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
line it's just straight and we're going

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.520 
line it's just straight and we're going
to<00:01:11.870> want<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.110> make<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.500> loop<00:01:13.190> an<00:01:13.520> overhand<00:01:14.120> loop

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
to want to make a loop an overhand loop

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.750 
to want to make a loop an overhand loop
now<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.680> want<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.920> make<00:01:16.040> sure<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.370> loop<00:01:16.610> is

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
now we want to make sure this loop is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.980 
now we want to make sure this loop is
big<00:01:16.970> enough<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.240> when<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.570> get<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
big enough to when we get it on the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
big enough to when we get it on the
arrow<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:19.040> going<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.370> tail<00:01:19.580> off<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.150> back

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
arrow it's going to tail off to the back

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.670 
arrow it's going to tail off to the back
and<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.750> not<00:01:20.900> going<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.110> interfere<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and it's not going to interfere with the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.320 
and it's not going to interfere with the
flight<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.040> arrow<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:22.970> want<00:01:23.120> a<00:01:23.150> pretty

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
flight of the arrow so you want a pretty

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.360 
flight of the arrow so you want a pretty
good<00:01:23.420> sized<00:01:23.750> loop<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.290> it's<00:01:25.070> just<00:01:25.250> an

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
good sized loop and it's just an

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.450 
good sized loop and it's just an
overhand<00:01:25.760> loop<00:01:26.770> plain<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.890> simple<00:01:27.950> how<00:01:28.400> to

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
overhand loop plain and simple how to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.520 
overhand loop plain and simple how to
tie<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
tie it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.260 
tie it
and<00:01:30.530> really<00:01:30.830> that's<00:01:30.950> all<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.310> want<00:01:31.490> just<00:01:32.120> like

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
that now you're going to take your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.030 
that now you're going to take your
safety<00:01:35.300> slide<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.990> you'll<00:01:36.260> notice<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.800> one

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
safety slide and you'll notice that one

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040 
safety slide and you'll notice that one
side<00:01:37.070> has<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.550> groove<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> other

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
side has a groove in it and the other

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.350 
side has a groove in it and the other
side<00:01:39.470> does<00:01:39.710> not<00:01:39.910> we're<00:01:40.910> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> take<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
side does not we're going to take and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.130 
side does not we're going to take and
we're<00:01:41.450> going<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.630> pinch<00:01:41.840> our<00:01:41.990> loop<00:01:42.170> tight<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
we're going to pinch our loop tight and

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.330 
we're going to pinch our loop tight and
we're<00:01:45.230> going<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.440> go<00:01:45.590> from<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.890> side<00:01:46.070> that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
we're going to go from the side that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.460 
we're going to go from the side that
does<00:01:46.610> not<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.210> groove<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.200> slide

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
does not have the groove to the slide

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.010 
does not have the groove to the slide
that<00:01:48.500> does<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.340> groove<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.900> just

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that does have the groove and you just

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840 
that does have the groove and you just
push<00:01:51.230> it<00:01:51.260> through<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.620> hole<00:01:51.680> pull<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:52.580> too<00:01:52.700> all

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
push it through the hole pull it too all

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790 
push it through the hole pull it too all
the<00:01:52.970> way<00:01:53.090> through<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.570> it'll<00:01:54.440> be<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:54.530> like

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
the way through and it'll be just like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.260 
the way through and it'll be just like
that<00:01:54.920> now<00:01:55.670> what<00:01:55.760> you're<00:01:55.910> going<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.150> is

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that now what you're going to do is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.240 
that now what you're going to do is
going<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.480> pinch<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.960> loop<00:01:57.260> again<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.860> we're

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
going to pinch that loop again and we're

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.920 
going to pinch that loop again and we're
going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.400> go<00:01:58.520> back<00:01:58.820> down<00:01:58.880> through<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.810> the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
going to go back down through to the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.300 
going to go back down through to the
other<00:02:00.050> side<00:02:00.200> just<00:02:01.300> like<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.800> you'll<00:02:04.100> end

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
other side just like this so you'll end

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.410 
other side just like this so you'll end
up<00:02:04.490> with<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:07.040> side<00:02:07.280> with<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> groove<00:02:07.880> we'll

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
up with the side with the groove we'll

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.809 
up with the side with the groove we'll
have<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> line<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.979> side<00:02:10.220> without<00:02:10.460> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
have the line on it the side without the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.320 
have the line on it the side without the
groove<00:02:11.180> won't

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
groove won't

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.650 
groove won't
now<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.710> very<00:02:15.040> important<00:02:15.640> how<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.420> do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
now this is very important how you do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.270 
now this is very important how you do
this<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.620> understand<00:02:18.100> why

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
this and you're going to understand why

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.780 
this and you're going to understand why
in<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.520> minute

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
in a minute

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
in a minute
you're<00:02:19.600> going<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.810> take<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.170> you've<00:02:20.260> got<00:02:20.350> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
you're going to take and you've got to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.930 
you're going to take and you've got to
keep<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.710> loop<00:02:20.950> open<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.520> you're<00:02:21.760> going<00:02:21.880> to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
keep this loop open and you're going to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.820 
keep this loop open and you're going to
go<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.360> nock<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.960> you're<00:02:23.530> going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.710> go

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
go to the nock and you're going to go

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.880 
go to the nock and you're going to go
down<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.550> up<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.390> over<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.720> nock<00:02:25.900> keep<00:02:26.710> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
down or up and over the nock keep the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.510 
down or up and over the nock keep the
loop<00:02:27.070> open<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.050> go<00:02:29.770> down<00:02:29.800> towards

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
loop open just like this go down towards

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.900 
loop open just like this go down towards
the<00:02:30.700> tip<00:02:31.200> around<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.160> then<00:02:33.430> all<00:02:33.460> you'll<00:02:33.790> have

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the tip around and then all you'll have

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.170 
the tip around and then all you'll have
to<00:02:34.000> do<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:35.050> pull<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.320> tight<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:36.910> arrows

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
to do is pull that tight and your arrows

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.360 
to do is pull that tight and your arrows
on<00:02:37.360> there<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.050> when<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.320> shoot<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.130> loop

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
on there so now when you shoot the loop

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.070 
on there so now when you shoot the loop
is<00:02:39.550> plenty<00:02:39.820> big<00:02:39.850> enough<00:02:40.180> at<00:02:40.360> tails<00:02:40.570> off<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
is plenty big enough at tails off to the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.910 
is plenty big enough at tails off to the
back<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:43.180> reason<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.960> wanted<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.710> tell<00:02:44.890> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
back the reason you I wanted to tell you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.850 
back the reason you I wanted to tell you
is<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.910> nock<00:02:46.150> then<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.380> tip<00:02:47.650> is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
is to do the nock then the tip is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.590 
is to do the nock then the tip is
because<00:02:48.610> if<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:48.940> would<00:02:49.090> shoot<00:02:49.270> through<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
because if you would shoot through a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.090 
because if you would shoot through a
fish<00:02:49.900> pass<00:02:50.320> through<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> way<00:02:50.890> your

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
fish pass through all the way your

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.500 
fish pass through all the way your
arrows<00:02:51.370> all<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> way<00:02:51.700> through<00:02:51.910> there<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
arrows all the way through there you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.850 
arrows all the way through there you
taking<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> time<00:02:53.140> you're<00:02:53.350> trying<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.740> it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
taking the time you're trying to get it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.949 
taking the time you're trying to get it
back<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> hole<00:02:54.490> or<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.480> end<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.750> cutting

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
back in the hole or you end up cutting

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.810 
back in the hole or you end up cutting
your<00:02:56.110> line<00:02:56.290> pulling<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.890> back<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.070> then<00:02:57.400> retie

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
your line pulling it back and then retie

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.310 
your line pulling it back and then retie
in<00:02:57.880> all<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.510> don't<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.140> that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
in all of this you don't have to do that

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.350 
in all of this you don't have to do that
with<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.620> not<00:02:59.830> what<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.610> want<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.880> do<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:01.180> you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
with this not what you want to do if you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.960 
with this not what you want to do if you
shoot<00:03:01.570> through<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.780> fish<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.430> take<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.910> grab

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
shoot through a fish and take and grab

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.920 
shoot through a fish and take and grab
that<00:03:04.209> loop<00:03:04.450> open<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.740> up<00:03:05.890> now<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:07.480> did<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
that loop open it up now we did the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.570 
that loop open it up now we did the
point<00:03:08.350> last<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.980> we're<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
point last so we're going to do the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.040 
point last so we're going to do the
point<00:03:09.850> first<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.390> if<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.540> do<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.840> every

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
point first and if you do this every

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.630 
point first and if you do this every
time<00:03:11.170> exactly<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> same<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.280> won't<00:03:12.430> have<00:03:12.520> to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
time exactly the same you won't have to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.760 
time exactly the same you won't have to
think<00:03:12.670> oh<00:03:13.000> how<00:03:13.720> did<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.990> do<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.170> did<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
think oh how did I do that did I do the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.500 
think oh how did I do that did I do the
point<00:03:15.010> first<00:03:15.220> at<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.490> point<00:03:15.730> last<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.180> just<00:03:16.390> do

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
point first at a point last so just do

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.660 
point first at a point last so just do
it<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> same<00:03:16.870> every<00:03:16.900> time<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.070> go<00:03:18.190> over<00:03:18.220> the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
it the same every time so we go over the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.110 
it the same every time so we go over the
point<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.330> keep<00:03:20.320> your<00:03:20.500> loop<00:03:20.680> open<00:03:21.120> come

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
point like this keep your loop open come

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.979 
point like this keep your loop open come
back<00:03:22.330> around

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
back around

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.370 
back around
you're<00:03:23.140> not<00:03:23.790> pull<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.180> it's<00:03:25.840> off<00:03:26.019> it's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
you're not pull it and it's off it's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.270 
you're not pull it and it's off it's
simple<00:03:26.800> as<00:03:26.890> that

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
simple as that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.820 
simple as that
no<00:03:27.730> cutting<00:03:28.150> your<00:03:28.239> line<00:03:28.510> no<00:03:29.110> more<00:03:29.290> retie<00:03:29.650> in

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
no cutting your line no more retie in

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.110 
no cutting your line no more retie in
your<00:03:29.980> line<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.550> it's<00:03:31.060> pretty<00:03:31.269> simple<00:03:33.120> now

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
your line and it's pretty simple now

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.870 
your line and it's pretty simple now
that<00:03:34.300> being<00:03:34.480> said<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:35.130> got<00:03:36.130> showed<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
that being said I got showed that a

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.120 
that being said I got showed that a
million<00:03:37.180> times<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.470> still<00:03:38.530> couldn't<00:03:38.890> get

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
million times and I still couldn't get

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.100 
million times and I still couldn't get
it<00:03:39.280> I'm<00:03:39.790> probably<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.209> little<00:03:40.360> bit<00:03:40.570> denser<00:03:40.930> than

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
it I'm probably a little bit denser than

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.680 
it I'm probably a little bit denser than
most<00:03:41.320> people<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.370> what<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.480> is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
most people so what I'm going to do is

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.440 
most people so what I'm going to do is
I've<00:03:43.870> made<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.140> bigger<00:03:44.980> scale<00:03:45.430> model<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.060> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
I've made a bigger scale model of a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.290 
I've made a bigger scale model of a
slide<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:47.140> an<00:03:47.260> arrow<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.739> some<00:03:48.640> string<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
slide in an arrow and some string and

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.790 
slide in an arrow and some string and
we're<00:03:49.600> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.750> try<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.019> show<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.590> so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
we're going to try to show it to you so

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.890 
we're going to try to show it to you so
you<00:03:50.830> can<00:03:51.100> see<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.000> big<00:03:52.180> scale<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.750> then

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
you can see it in a big scale and then

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.090 
you can see it in a big scale and then
we'll<00:03:53.019> go<00:03:53.140> back<00:03:53.170> we'll<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.709> on<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.890> little

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
we'll go back we'll do it on the little

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.030 
we'll go back we'll do it on the little
one<00:03:54.220> again<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.610> it'll<00:03:54.760> be<00:03:54.880> done<00:03:55.890> first<00:03:56.890> thing

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
one again and it'll be done first thing

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.440 
one again and it'll be done first thing
you<00:03:57.220> want<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.459> do<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.850> want<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.060> tie<00:03:58.209> your

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
you want to do is you want to tie your

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.199 
you want to do is you want to tie your
overhand<00:03:59.380> knot

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
overhand knot

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.970 
overhand knot
your<00:04:01.209> overhand<00:04:01.660> loop<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.440> we'll<00:04:02.560> make<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> big

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
your overhand loop so we'll make a big

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.520 
your overhand loop so we'll make a big
loop<00:04:03.190> here<00:04:05.850> just<00:04:06.850> like<00:04:07.000> this

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.340 

okay<00:04:10.530> now<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.100> is<00:04:11.190> our<00:04:11.340> loop<00:04:12.170> we're<00:04:13.170> going<00:04:13.200> to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
okay now that is our loop we're going to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.680 
okay now that is our loop we're going to
take<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.710> we're<00:04:13.800> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> come<00:04:15.440> from<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
take and we're going to come from the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.820 
take and we're going to come from the
back<00:04:18.690> side<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.410> slide<00:04:20.120> through<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.269> hole

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
back side of the slide through the hole

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.630 
back side of the slide through the hole
pull<00:04:22.830> our<00:04:22.980> loop<00:04:23.510> go<00:04:24.510> through<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.900> other<00:04:25.020> side

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
pull our loop go through the other side

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:34.210 
pull our loop go through the other side
back<00:04:26.640> down<00:04:29.960> like<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.460> pull<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.580> tight

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
back down like that pull it tight

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.940 
back down like that pull it tight
flip<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.370> over<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.210> can<00:04:36.390> see<00:04:36.570> okay<00:04:37.530> now

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
flip it over so you can see okay now

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.920 
flip it over so you can see okay now
what<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.970> want<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.390> keep<00:04:39.570> your<00:04:39.720> low

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
what you want to do is keep your low

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.560 
what you want to do is keep your low
loop<00:04:40.230> big<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.790> want<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.030> go<00:04:42.150> over<00:04:44.570> the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
loop big and you want to go over the

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.840 
loop big and you want to go over the
nock<00:04:45.750> end<00:04:47.270> keeping<00:04:48.270> your<00:04:48.419> loop<00:04:48.570> open<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:51.140> over

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
nock end keeping your loop open and over

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.740 
nock end keeping your loop open and over
your<00:04:53.850> AirLand<00:04:55.280> now<00:04:56.330> when<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.419> pull<00:04:57.630> this

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
your AirLand now when you pull this

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.150 
your AirLand now when you pull this
tight<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.200> that's<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.500> like<00:05:04.800> we<00:05:04.980> had

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
tight you see that's just like we had

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.590 
tight you see that's just like we had
tails<00:05:05.550> off<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.030> back<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.450> everything

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
tails off to the back and everything

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.040 
tails off to the back and everything
else<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.490> hope<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.820> understood<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.540> we'll

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
else so I hope you understood that we'll

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.110 
else so I hope you understood that we'll
do<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.260> one<00:05:10.410> more<00:05:10.440> time<00:05:10.620> on<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.160> arrow<00:05:11.310> you'll

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
do it one more time on the arrow you'll

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.690 
do it one more time on the arrow you'll
see<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.450> smaller<00:05:13.250> again<00:05:14.250> we<00:05:14.460> tied<00:05:14.669> our

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
see it smaller again we tied our

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.540 
see it smaller again we tied our
overhand<00:05:15.300> loop<00:05:15.479> now

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
overhand loop now

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.270 
overhand loop now
we're<00:05:17.550> going<00:05:17.669> to<00:05:17.760> go<00:05:17.850> from<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.210> back<00:05:18.479> side<00:05:18.840> of

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
we're going to go from the back side of

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.110 
we're going to go from the back side of
the<00:05:20.280> slide<00:05:22.130> pinch<00:05:23.130> your<00:05:23.310> pinch<00:05:23.790> your<00:05:23.940> loop

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
the slide pinch your pinch your loop

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.480 
the slide pinch your pinch your loop
together<00:05:24.710> go<00:05:25.710> through<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.040> hole<00:05:27.650> pull<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.770> up

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.420 

go<00:05:32.490> back<00:05:33.380> pinch<00:05:34.380> your<00:05:34.530> knot<00:05:34.680> again<00:05:34.830> or<00:05:35.250> your
