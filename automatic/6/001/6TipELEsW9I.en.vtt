suppose<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.229> move<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> microwave<00:01:50.130> but

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
suppose I could move the microwave but

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.859 
suppose I could move the microwave but
I'd<00:01:50.429> really<00:01:50.670> rather<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.939> pull<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> down<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.750> my

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I'd really rather not pull it down on my

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.969 
I'd really rather not pull it down on my
head<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> potentially<00:01:52.770> break<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.329> all<00:01:54.329> right

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
head and potentially break it all right

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
head and potentially break it all right
let's<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.130> serious<00:01:56.450> wouldn't<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.569> anything

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
let's get serious wouldn't want anything

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.289 
let's get serious wouldn't want anything
bad<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.289> happen<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.459> probably<00:01:59.610> oughta<00:01:59.880> wrap

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
bad to happen so we probably oughta wrap

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
bad to happen so we probably oughta wrap
