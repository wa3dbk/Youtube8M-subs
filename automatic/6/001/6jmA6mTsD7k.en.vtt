the<00:00:18.210> stakes<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.720> placed<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.109> far<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the stakes are placed that far out so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
the stakes are placed that far out so
they<00:00:20.039> won't<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.369> disturbed<00:00:20.789> when<00:00:21.090> you

excavate I would suggest maybe the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.160 
excavate I would suggest maybe the
foreman<00:00:23.880> needs<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> choice

foreman needs to know what the choice

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.450 
foreman needs to know what the choice
was<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.010> he<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.279> lay<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> job<00:00:27.000> properly

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
was so he can lay out the job properly

excavate first you run string lines from
the<00:00:34.739> great<00:00:34.980> steps<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.940> measure<00:00:36.239> down

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the great steps and then measure down

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.900 
the great steps and then measure down
for<00:00:36.840> elevation<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.980> always<00:00:38.370> measure<00:00:38.579> down

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
for elevation you always measure down

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.569 
for elevation you always measure down
from<00:00:39.270> where<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> finished<00:00:39.840> grade<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.290> be

since this job is a redo

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.490 
since this job is a redo
we'll<00:00:43.200> use<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.620> existing<00:00:43.890> elevation<00:00:45.320> for<00:00:46.320> new

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we'll use the existing elevation for new
