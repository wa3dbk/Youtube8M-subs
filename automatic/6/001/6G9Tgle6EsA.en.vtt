00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.960
 the manager also checked these cleanings 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.029
 these cleanups right we see that 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.529
 The lamp is burned and we 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.840
 show the lamp 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.450
 we see that there is a leak in the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.680
 we see that there is a painting that 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.689
 It is in need 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.899
 in the time that you share the people 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.860
 call the painter 4 who is ready 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.859
 chic, and then we see things 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.059
 so sometimes there is a penalty may not have 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.429
 seen something we see because 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.260

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.190
 look from the empty themed drawer that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.020

 leaves things in the safe locked up 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
 So if the glass the safe is locked I 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.220
 You immediately have to call our 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.250

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.630
 room is clean by a flower a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.390

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.300
 How's it going I'm seeing here that you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.370

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.750
 room now for me now why 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.850
 I finish doing supervision in the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 room I've already near the buttons here in 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.800
 room phone appears that was 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.290
 in protest, then at any time 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940
 moment the staff of the fundef can do the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.640
 check in the room so I did 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.050
 hit is ready then call more 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.700
 usually when we see him already 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.320
 there were employees seeing the light 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.030
 Sunday is not working so what? 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.770
 will happen when the manager should 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.380
 get to 4 he will look with this 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.239
 The fire is burning, it will bind the Indian. 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.910
 will tell if someone here in 307 just with the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.250
 refrigerator lamp and this is one of the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.900
 The maid's chores are also checked in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.210
 a maid does not come to take me 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.810
 they did not open it here 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.590
 This is a manager who makes the maid. 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.400
 She cleaned it out of the dust here. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.710
 she does not in Mexico, and then I do 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.700
 for here it 's good, I'm watching the time it is 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.810
 able to rescue the two drawers 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.910
 I'll see if the television is 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.230
 Running, I turn on the TV. 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:24.680
 to see if she is 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:25.400
 Working right, I think he 's 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.550
 happy 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.490
 he does not have to pick up the phone you 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.470
 This has to end the maid. 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.870
 forgot to put the shampoo 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.370
 We do not want this, we really want it. 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.280
 on the contrary having abundance 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.310
 what is to never have to call parana 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.070
 understood that the judge understands 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.300
 you have to make the person stay 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.130
 comfortable it gets there it has everything 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.260
 she can take a shower so she can see 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.770
 TV to be able to sleep everything 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.770

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.650
 ae
