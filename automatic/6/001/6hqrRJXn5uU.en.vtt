 move our heart as an assistant subject with the ministers and 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.669
 Today I know that it can be true when it has fallen 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.279
 love near them from people 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.539
 swords that devote time 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.779

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 ii wines 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.269
 what to do when there is abuse 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.460
 definitely when there is abuse if for example 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.980
 someone who 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.290
 it's close to home 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.560
 of this highlighted person who is mistreating a rally and specifically 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.760
 I know what to report 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 they denounce 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.550
 percent we can allow our children 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.519
 our children of the little one but be mistreated 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.860
 not for his dad 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 nor for his mom 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.060
 germany 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.500
 will correct the damage 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.650
 i yes yes no 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.970
 I have gone through this 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 the truth that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 we're going to have 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 a lot more children on the street 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 much more play to study the pact that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.660
 to 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.460
 this query that consume 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.190
 that is the best 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.620
 but when they are with their daddy peace 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.980
 and I have skated nanny ciaam acts of children that is unsafe 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.640
 surrounded by love of security 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.220
 and that they are well 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 good morning 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.470
 safe 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.579
 then at 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.690
 denounce them there are 180 either dad mom or whoever 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.649
 Denounce him do not be afraid 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.610
 before the police station 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.610
 iris this whole problem in this house what can I do 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.329
 and that is going to advise that you go to at a lot and follow other 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.110
 percent to follow-ups 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.030
 I knew that being afraid you have to go to the police station and denounce 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.840
 the violence the aggression more assholes not because 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 now it's different type of injury or because there is physical violence that the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.729
 what else 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.129
 we see but there is another kind of violence that is a bit hidden that the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.909
 violence and psychological aggression 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.959
 parents that your children tell you clumsy you will never achieve anything you are useless 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.469
 right June 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.379
 it's true and they really make children grow up with 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.679
 that mentality young people were growing account that can not anything 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.189
 that they are fools 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.939
 that they will never achieve anything 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.760
 pt teams can parents who maybe do not harm their children 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.889
 physically but that maybe and are logically damaging it mistreats them 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.609
 we should not feel less and instead of giving them love backs 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.740
 this psychological trend 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.369
 definitely look 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:59.209
 al pati christian non christians does not interest 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 we in our mouth have a power 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.879
 amended the power 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.329
 by marcy build being able to knock down 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.449
 we have the power must decide 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.849
 om when saying 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.980
 and when a child is you and sector that you do not serve at all 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.009
 you're here 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.259
 and going to the depths of their being and these saying a lie 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.760
 because the guild is wrong but it does not mean that it is not clumsy or noval 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.869
 to children you have to encourage them look if you do something I care about the dam of hills 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.229
 is the best 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.459
 you can 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.309
 you are a champion keep going 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.299
 no matter 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.439
 when the boys have canceled the daddies and humanity 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.950
 endorsed chastity 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.159
 to equip the road 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.859
 with the meaning nothing 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.149
 humala simply means that it has to be a little more 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.339
 help him 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.829

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.709

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.099

 dreaming really clear all current tired that this time Thursday we fail but 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.049
 that the next one of the mossos we are going to achieve better things 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.930
 that if we make a mistake today 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.000

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.840

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.110
 before 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.009

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.450

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.600
 no 3 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.080

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.360
 until he succeeded 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.740
