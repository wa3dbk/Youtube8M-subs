think it's spring and they'll start
coming<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.490> spiders<00:01:45.090> won't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
coming out but you know spiders won't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.050 
coming out but you know spiders won't
bother<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.630> worry<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> not

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
bother you don't worry about it it's not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.270 
bother you don't worry about it it's not
um<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:50.040> I've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.329> one<00:01:51.329> clump<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
um so right here I've got one clump of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
um so right here I've got one clump of
grass<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.850> debris<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.450> picked<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.840> along

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
grass and debris that I picked up along

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
grass and debris that I picked up along
the<00:01:55.350> river<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.250> huge<00:01:56.670> clumps<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the river it's a huge clumps because the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.800 
the river it's a huge clumps because the
water<00:01:57.840> washes<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.829> gets<00:01:58.950> stuck<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
water washes it up and it gets stuck in

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.760 
water washes it up and it gets stuck in
thorns<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.930> branches<00:02:01.229> along<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> river

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
thorns and branches along the river

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
thorns and branches along the river
banks<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.880> handful<00:02:03.329> just

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
banks this is just one handful just

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
banks this is just one handful just
grabbed<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> could<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.500> about<00:02:04.590> 10<00:02:04.920> or

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
grabbed I could go back at about 10 or

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.160 
grabbed I could go back at about 10 or
12<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.909> fill<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.689> those<00:02:06.869> cracks

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
12 more and fill in all those cracks

12 more and fill in all those cracks
back<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.970> start<00:02:09.270> making<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> bed

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

animal traffic along here that I could

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.610 
animal traffic along here that I could
see<00:02:26.400> other<00:02:26.580> than<00:02:26.700> small<00:02:27.470> possums<00:02:28.470> and

poop<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.510> no<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.960> using<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.260> as

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
poop in here so no one is using this as

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.950 
poop in here so no one is using this as
a<00:02:34.470> any<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.250> shelter<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.300> themselves<00:02:36.660> I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
a any kind of shelter for themselves I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.530 
a any kind of shelter for themselves I
mean<00:02:37.500> perfect<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.090> said<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.420> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
mean perfect so like I said this is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.090 
mean perfect so like I said this is
pretty<00:02:39.750> obvious<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.470> find<00:02:40.770> smaller

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
pretty obvious you can find smaller

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.980 
pretty obvious you can find smaller
versions<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.610> these<00:02:42.150> type<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.510> trees<00:02:42.840> along

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
versions of these type of trees along

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
versions of these type of trees along
here<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:43.440> two<00:02:43.620> other<00:02:43.830> ones<00:02:44.010> along<00:02:44.310> here

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
here there's two other ones along here

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.550 
here there's two other ones along here
that<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.510> also<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.870> suitable<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.440> they're

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that would also be suitable but they're

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.960 
that would also be suitable but they're
not<00:02:46.650> quite<00:02:46.800> as<00:02:46.920> big<00:02:47.190> you'd<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.670> sit<00:02:47.910> in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
not quite as big you'd have to sit in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.510 
not quite as big you'd have to sit in
them<00:02:48.240> make<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> fire<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> your<00:02:49.860> feet<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
them make a fire kind of your feet and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.610 
them make a fire kind of your feet and
it<00:02:50.820> would<00:02:50.910> keep<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.180> warm<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it would keep you warm and out of the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.950 
it would keep you warm and out of the
elements<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.390> probably<00:02:54.570> be<00:02:54.810> able<00:02:54.870> to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
elements but you probably be able to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.450 
elements but you probably be able to
sleep<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> could<00:02:55.650> sleep<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
sleep this one you could sleep in you

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.130 
sleep this one you could sleep in you
can<00:02:56.610> build<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> fire<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.240> sleep<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.570> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
can build a fire you can sleep in it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.840 
can build a fire you can sleep in it's
also<00:02:58.290> completely<00:02:58.770> camouflaged<00:02:58.920> from<00:02:59.760> the

also completely camouflaged from the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.420 
also completely camouflaged from the
other<00:02:59.970> side<00:03:00.240> from<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> Riverside<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:02.040> pros

other side from the Riverside that pros

other side from the Riverside that pros
and<00:03:02.610> cons<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.000> obviously<00:03:03.390> are<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.600> you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and cons of that obviously are if you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.910 
and cons of that obviously are if you
want<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:03.960> found<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:04.410> gonna<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.620> hard<00:03:04.800> for

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
want to be found it's gonna be hard for

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.020 
want to be found it's gonna be hard for
anyone<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.130> find<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.490> when<00:03:05.610> you're<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.910> this

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
anyone to find you when you're in this

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.490 
anyone to find you when you're in this
thing<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.540> might<00:03:06.840> want<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:06.990> mark<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.380> with

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
thing so you might want to mark it with

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.380 
thing so you might want to mark it with
something<00:03:07.680> bright<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.580> that's<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.880> it's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
something bright but that's it it's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.550 
something bright but that's it it's
pretty<00:03:09.450> cool<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.930> thought<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.260> kind<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.410> neat

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
pretty cool I thought it's kind of neat

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.150 
pretty cool I thought it's kind of neat
I'd<00:03:10.680> share<00:03:10.860> with<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:12.090> yeah
