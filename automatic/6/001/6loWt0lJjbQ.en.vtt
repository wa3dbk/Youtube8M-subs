revenue<00:03:46.040> coverage<00:03:46.640> on<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:47.060> all<00:03:47.480> my<00:03:47.660> wheat<00:03:47.930> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
revenue coverage on on all my wheat and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.440 
revenue coverage on on all my wheat and
and<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.890> think<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.430> know<00:03:49.520> over<00:03:49.730> time<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.270> not

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
and I think you know over time it's not

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.970 
and I think you know over time it's not
going<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.660> be<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> moneymaker<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.710> risk

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
going to be a moneymaker it's a risk

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.040 
going to be a moneymaker it's a risk
management<00:03:52.070> tool<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.240> think<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:53.840> very

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
management tool that I think it's very

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.780 
management tool that I think it's very
important<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.560> wheat<00:03:54.770> farmers<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.310> mean<00:03:55.460> when

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
important to wheat farmers I mean when

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.190 
important to wheat farmers I mean when
you<00:03:55.910> live<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.180> an<00:03:56.330> area<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.600> house<00:03:56.810> drew<00:03:57.050> do

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
you live in an area that house drew do

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.990 
you live in an area that house drew do
but<00:03:57.650> where<00:03:57.830> we'd<00:03:58.040> has<00:03:58.220> grown<00:03:58.460> there's

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
but where we'd has grown there's

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.240 
but where we'd has grown there's
potential<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.480> drought<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.470> just<00:04:00.890> got

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
potential for drought and and just got

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.280 
potential for drought and and just got
crop<00:04:01.550> failures<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.870> need<00:04:03.020> something

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
crop failures and so you need something

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.140 
crop failures and so you need something
to<00:04:03.380> even<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.830> out<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.550> don't<00:04:04.880> know<00:04:05.000> that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
to even that out and I don't know that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.640 
to even that out and I don't know that
you're<00:04:05.270> going<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.420> be<00:04:05.480> making<00:04:05.900> money<00:04:06.350> with

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
you're going to be making money with

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.290 
you're going to be making money with
crop<00:04:06.890> insurance<00:04:07.040> but<00:04:07.550> at<00:04:07.670> least<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.940> evens<00:04:08.180> out

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
crop insurance but at least it evens out

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.290 
crop insurance but at least it evens out
the<00:04:08.360> risk<00:04:08.950> what<00:04:09.950> will<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.100> mean<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.460> your

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
the risk what will that mean to your

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.940 
the risk what will that mean to your
association<00:04:12.080> but<00:04:12.200> just<00:04:12.380> wheat<00:04:12.560> growers<00:04:12.920> in

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
association but just wheat growers in

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.580 
association but just wheat growers in
general<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.430> mean<00:04:13.580> we<00:04:13.850> lose<00:04:14.090> them<00:04:14.960> probably

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
general I mean we lose them probably

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.470 
general I mean we lose them probably
would<00:04:15.830> lose<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.040> lot<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.310> weed<00:04:16.670> acres<00:04:17.030> in<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.239> US

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
would lose a lot of weed acres in the US

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.390 
would lose a lot of weed acres in the US
that<00:04:17.510> were<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.019> happen<00:04:18.080> with<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.440> not<00:04:18.620> most

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
that were to happen with it not most

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.570 
that were to happen with it not most
definitely<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.030> mean<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:21.410> know<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.560> believe<00:04:22.370> in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
definitely I mean you know I believe in

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.880 
definitely I mean you know I believe in
a<00:04:22.670> food<00:04:22.940> policy<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.140> our<00:04:24.230> country<00:04:24.470> and

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
a food policy and for our country and

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.090 
a food policy and for our country and
hence<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.570> part<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.980> think

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
hence and part of that is I think

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.090 
hence and part of that is I think
keeping<00:04:28.660> agriculture<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.990> our<00:04:30.350> country<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:30.980> I

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
keeping agriculture in our country and I

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.250 
keeping agriculture in our country and I
think<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.460> most<00:04:31.670> better<00:04:32.060> self<00:04:32.660> sustaining<00:04:33.140> we

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
think the most better self sustaining we

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.700 
think the most better self sustaining we
can<00:04:33.440> be<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.800> better<00:04:33.950> off<00:04:34.220> we<00:04:34.430> are<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.120> nation

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
can be the better off we are as a nation

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.500 
can be the better off we are as a nation
that's<00:04:36.710> just<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.670> know<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.060> just

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
that's just you know that I just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.930 
that's just you know that I just
strongly<00:04:38.840> believe<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.700> think

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
strongly believe that and and I think

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.210 
strongly believe that and and I think
most<00:04:41.060> people<00:04:41.450> would<00:04:41.480> too<00:04:42.130> dependent<00:04:43.130> on

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
most people would too dependent on

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.430 
most people would too dependent on
foreign<00:04:43.580> sources<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.120> food<00:04:44.420> is<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:45.320> know

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
foreign sources of food is you know

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.430 
foreign sources of food is you know
could<00:04:45.620> be<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:46.400> know<00:04:46.550> hit<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:46.970> miss<00:04:47.180> on

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
could be you know hit and miss on

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.620 
could be you know hit and miss on
availability<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.680> price<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.850> quality<00:04:50.600> of

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
availability and price so and quality of

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.480 
availability and price so and quality of
food<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.169> safety<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.710> food<00:04:51.919> I<00:04:52.130> mean<00:04:52.280> there's<00:04:52.430> a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
food and safety of food I mean there's a

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.490 
food and safety of food I mean there's a
whole<00:04:52.820> array<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.270> issues<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.960> could<00:04:54.320> be

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
whole array of issues that could be

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.470 
whole array of issues that could be
attributed<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.310> growing<00:04:55.940> our<00:04:56.000> own<00:04:56.060> food<00:04:56.210> and

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
attributed to growing our own food and

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.150 
attributed to growing our own food and
having<00:04:56.900> control<00:04:57.290> over<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.950> is<00:04:58.130> that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
having control over that and is that

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.560 
having control over that and is that
something<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:58.850> can<00:04:59.030> afford<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.480> the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
something that we can afford in the
