00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.799
 because you were in 2002 and this time 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.559
 I bring you a new guide to the achievement of 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.959
 halo 4 since with the update that 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.469
 came out today for this game came out 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.500
 new achievements and one of them is called 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.080
 plant the store that consists of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.089
 stay camping in a place in 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.119
 any game of matchmaking by 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.349
 minus 60 seconds now although it sounds 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.179
 easy many people have sent me 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.460
 enough messages telling me hey lyon 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.230
 because I do not get this achievement if I stay 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.340
 there 60 seconds and I do not get the achievement 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.320
 well I tried several times and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.020
 discover some things that this has 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.059
 interesting then and here they 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.530
 I have the results and how to unlock 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.020
 this achievement 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.850
 first of all clarify that this achievement 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.739
 It can be done in any kind of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 always starting and when in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.540
 matchmaking that is either murderous 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.440
 he received flags blah blah blah whatever 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.030
 but the matchmaking now the interesting thing 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.260
 of this achievement 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.050
 this achievement asks you to stay 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.000
 roaming in an area 60 seconds but 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.610
 of what I realized is that if you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.799
 you move at least a little bit of the area in 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.659
 the one that you're no longer golden with so 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.440
 that you have to stay in 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.200
 other zones 60 seconds but so 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.060
 I have seen the pain requires you to be 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 completely still you can not be 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.210
 crouching you can flip but if the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.520
 character moves at least a little 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.690
 of the area in which it is no longer 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.479
 the side do you have to start over 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.780
 from the beginning then that's what I 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.770
 I realized in my first attempts 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.429
 obviously trying to do this 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.259
 achievement 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.740
 here in this gameplay that is a game 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.070
 in lectern because they are for so I 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.770
 tests and x and I bring them to you 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.380
 what they are seeing is a gameplay in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
 fast camera of at least 2 minutes in 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.210
 which I'm here giving in an area 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.180
 but even though two minutes have passed, 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 they give me the achievement because then for the same 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.899
 I was moving and that affects achievement 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 where can I think and I said good if I 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.840
 I move because I'm changing then what 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.370
 would happen if I stay totally still 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.090
 it would give me achievement because I did it and this was 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.090
 what happened 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.480
 and for this I achieved unlocked planting 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.190
 the store as they see everything is a matter of 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.890
 stay in the same place and not do 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.010
 nothing and this makes it easier to give you the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.480
 achievement and can go parts is everything I hope 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.870
 that this herb has already helped our 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 users who asked me how to get out 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.750
 from here I say goodbye
