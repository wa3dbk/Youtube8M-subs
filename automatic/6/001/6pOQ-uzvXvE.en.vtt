00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.350
 hi i am andre and this is the lg popo 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 a portable photo printer that is perfect 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.700
 integrates with your smartphone 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.150
 the usual adapter and usb cable 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.920
 are of course included and in addition 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.070
 find ten more sheets put inc 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.020
 paper de popo is made of plastic 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.460
 with a heart motif 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.830
 we also see an on and off button 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.000
 and and the large drawers that hold the paper 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.980
 can be placed 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.170
 lg creates a product with the popo 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.489
 that lets you take a photo anywhere and quickly 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.010
 can print small format 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.050
 photos that come out of the popo have a 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.239
 small size and are printed by 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.949
 zero inc technology 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.170
 therefore you do not need cartridges 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.949
 but you need a special zero in paper 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.229
 purchase 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.629
 what has been developed for this printer is the 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.489
 colors that can be seen on these photos 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.589
 come across a little flashier than they are in the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.809
 you can be a reality for printing 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.100
 use the application that lg 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.239
 specially for this printer 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.829
 developed 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.870
 provide the applications with the number 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.120
 nice features so you can with a photo 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.369
 Add a qr code, but you can 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 also rotate photo or displays as well 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.270
 a little bit of editing too are there 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.130
 many connectivity options with the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.920
 popo he doesn't have it alone 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.210
 about bluetooth but also about nfc and this 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.280
 means that you only have to go once 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.380
 Dab your phone against the printer 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.520
 which causes the application to open and 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 you can start printing immediately 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.090
 lg wants to create a gadget with the popo 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.430
 with which we, just like in the old days with the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.090
 Polaroid camera photos immediately tangible 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.159
 can make 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.689
 however, there is also a downside to it 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.359
 the use of the specific paper 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.310
 the costs per photo are quite high and 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.679
 in addition, the photos are also quite small 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.780
 that is due to the format of the printer 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.520
 yet the lg succeeded in having a nice one 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.560
 compact and easy to operate 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.770
 to set up a photo printer with a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.200
 you want the lg popo for some nice functions
