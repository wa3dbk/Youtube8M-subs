00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
inspired by funky pink gal because I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.680 
inspired by funky pink gal because I
once<00:00:16.949> saw<00:00:17.160> her<00:00:17.369> make<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.150> cute<00:00:18.359> little

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
didn't like it so they look very
different<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
different and I do like the one on the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
different and I do like the one on the
left<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.670> this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
left but not the one on the right this

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
left but not the one on the right this
little<00:01:48.689> orange<00:01:48.869> McCarron<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:50.130> some

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
little orange McCarron with some

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.999 
little orange McCarron with some
strawberries<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> whipped<00:01:51.780> cream<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.380> would

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
strawberries and whipped cream I would

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.130 
strawberries and whipped cream I would
call<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.460> charm<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.360> forgot<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
call it a charm but I actually forgot to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
call it a charm but I actually forgot to
put<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.530> pins<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> these<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> guess

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
put I pins in all of these so I guess

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.490 
put I pins in all of these so I guess
it's<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.649> miniature<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:01.200> next

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
supposed to be an orange slice but it

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.539 
supposed to be an orange slice but it
didn't<00:02:15.400> turn<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.640> very<00:02:15.700> well<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.359> yeah<00:02:17.549> this

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
didn't turn out very well so yeah this

didn't turn out very well so yeah this
next<00:02:18.909> one<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.090> probably<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:19.900> most<00:02:20.079> failed<00:02:20.469> of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
next one is probably the most failed of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.890

kiwi<00:02:27.909> on<00:02:28.060> top<00:02:28.299> although<00:02:29.139> in<00:02:29.409> my<00:02:29.590> personal

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
kiwi on top although in my personal

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.940 
kiwi on top although in my personal
opinion<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:31.030> fruit<00:02:31.329> on<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.750> top<00:02:31.959> does<00:02:32.769> not

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
opinion the fruit on the top does not

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.809 
opinion the fruit on the top does not
look<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.340> good<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.560> orange<00:02:35.920> slice<00:02:36.219> looks<00:02:36.519> kind

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
look so good the orange slice looks kind

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.589 
look so good the orange slice looks kind
of<00:02:36.879> like<00:02:36.939> a<00:02:37.469> croissant<00:02:38.469> so<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.609> might<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.389> trying

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
of like a croissant so I might be trying

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.949 
of like a croissant so I might be trying
again<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.139> future<00:02:41.909> then<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:43.150> made<00:02:43.359> a<00:02:43.569> tiny

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
again in the future then a made a tiny

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.800 
again in the future then a made a tiny
green<00:02:44.409> macron<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.790> has<00:02:46.510> some

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
green macron it just has some

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.020 
green macron it just has some
blueberries<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.500> top<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.159> use<00:02:48.430> some<00:02:48.790> rose

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
blueberries on top and I use some rose

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.270 
blueberries on top and I use some rose
quartz<00:02:49.510> clay<00:02:49.870> for<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.349> filling<00:02:50.889> and<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
quartz clay for the filling and the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.159 
quartz clay for the filling and the
whipped<00:02:51.819> cream<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.269> top<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.079> a

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
whipped cream on top I think it's a

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.659 
whipped cream on top I think it's a
really<00:02:53.319> pretty<00:02:53.620> clay<00:02:56.189> way<00:02:57.189> I<00:02:57.219> made<00:02:57.549> this

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
little cake slice and i used the rose

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.970 
little cake slice and i used the rose
quartz<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.870> center<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> cake<00:03:02.739> roll

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
quartz for the center of the cake roll

quartz for the center of the cake roll
however<00:03:03.730> i<00:03:04.060> didn't<00:03:04.510> realize<00:03:04.719> how<00:03:04.870> translucent

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
below if you want to make something very

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.719 
below if you want to make something very
similar<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.250> hers<00:03:51.250> was<00:03:51.430> much<00:03:51.579> better

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
similar and hers was much better

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.909 
similar and hers was much better
obviously<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.509> um<00:03:52.540> yep<00:03:53.319> that's<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.799> how

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
obviously but um yep that's just how

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.770 
obviously but um yep that's just how
that<00:03:54.069> turned<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:55.299> then<00:03:55.449> I<00:03:55.479> made<00:03:55.750> a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
that turned out so then I made a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.800 
that turned out so then I made a
blueberry<00:03:56.139> pie<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.009> I<00:03:57.430> coated<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.000> top<00:03:58.509> in

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
blueberry pie and I coated the top in

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.850 
blueberry pie and I coated the top in
some<00:03:59.319> glitter<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.639> resemble<00:04:01.479> sugar<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.079> guess

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
some glitter to resemble sugar I guess

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.830 
some glitter to resemble sugar I guess
it's<00:04:04.490> kind<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.820> hard<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.120> see<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.480> berries

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
it's kind of hard to see the berries

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.200 
it's kind of hard to see the berries
because<00:04:06.260> they're<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:06.890> dark<00:04:07.190> but<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.760> did<00:04:08.000> roll

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
because they're so dark but I did roll

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.200 
because they're so dark but I did roll
them<00:04:08.420> out<00:04:08.540> individually<00:04:09.700> then<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.730> made<00:04:11.000> two

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
them out individually then I made two

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.480 
them out individually then I made two
pumpkin<00:04:11.390> pies<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.770> first<00:04:13.040> 1i<00:04:13.250> made

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
pumpkin pies this is the first 1i made

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.890 
pumpkin pies this is the first 1i made
it's<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.970> bit<00:04:14.150> flatter<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.450> how<00:04:17.750> it

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
it's a bit flatter and this is how it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's a bit flatter and this is how it
looks<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.560> kind<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.070> turned<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:19.400> one<00:04:19.609> into<00:04:19.730> a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
looks I kind of turned this one into a

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.380 
looks I kind of turned this one into a
charm<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:21.290> just<00:04:21.560> used<00:04:21.769> some<00:04:21.859> TLS<00:04:22.430> for<00:04:23.360> a

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
charm and I just used some TLS for a

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.450 
charm and I just used some TLS for a
cool<00:04:23.630> whip<00:04:23.900> on<00:04:24.110> top<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.040> second<00:04:25.340> one<00:04:25.430> I

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
cool whip on top and the second one I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.450 
cool whip on top and the second one I
made<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:26.180> bit<00:04:26.390> thicker<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.950> got<00:04:28.220> more

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
made is a bit thicker and it's got more

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.000 
made is a bit thicker and it's got more
cool<00:04:28.850> whip<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.180> top<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:29.870> that's<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.500> how<00:04:30.890> it

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
cool whip on top so that's just how it

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.540 
cool whip on top so that's just how it
looks<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:32.140> do<00:04:33.140> like<00:04:33.470> these<00:04:33.650> pretty<00:04:33.980> well<00:04:34.190> even

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.740 
looks I do like these pretty well even
