00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
one of the ways that my dogs learned

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.220 
one of the ways that my dogs learned
sweating<00:04:40.180> communes<00:04:40.450> too<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.840> biked<00:04:41.080> with

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
sweating communes too as I biked with

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.660 
sweating communes too as I biked with
them<00:04:41.320> before<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.680> sweated<00:04:41.980> with<00:04:42.190> them<00:04:42.340> except

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
them before I sweated with them except

and Shiloh and Oakley they all

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.220 
and Shiloh and Oakley they all
eventually<00:04:54.370> just<00:04:54.940> picked<00:04:55.450> up<00:04:55.600> on<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.080> mean

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
eventually just picked up on it I mean

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.630 
eventually just picked up on it I mean
I'm<00:04:56.410> sure<00:04:56.560> there<00:04:56.920> are<00:04:57.070> probably<00:04:57.430> more

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
I'm sure there are probably more

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.550 
I'm sure there are probably more

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
efficient ways of training them and I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.340 
efficient ways of training them and I
treat<00:04:59.800> for<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.040> but<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.150> how<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.600> train<00:05:01.930> my

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
treat for you but that is how I train my

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.900 
treat for you but that is how I train my
girls<00:05:02.650> whenever<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:03.100> get<00:05:03.190> my<00:05:03.400> breaks<00:05:03.640> I<00:05:03.760> was

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
girls whenever I get my breaks I was

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.940 
girls whenever I get my breaks I was
saying<00:05:04.120> whoa<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:05.200> know<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.500> they<00:05:05.650> feel<00:05:05.920> that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
saying whoa you know so they feel that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.500 
saying whoa you know so they feel that
pullback<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.670> they<00:05:06.940> feel<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.360> they're

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
pullback and they feel that they're

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.110 
pullback and they feel that they're
being<00:05:07.720> forcing<00:05:08.230> forced<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:08.920> slow<00:05:09.190> down<00:05:09.400> that

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
being forcing forced to slow down that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.520 
being forcing forced to slow down that
helps<00:05:10.510> them<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.780> slow<00:05:10.960> down<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.350> that's

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
helps them to slow down so that's

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.130 
helps them to slow down so that's

in the other video this is just a safety
um<00:05:43.900> I<00:05:44.490> modified<00:05:45.490> my<00:05:45.760> hook<00:05:46.090> on<00:05:46.210> my<00:05:46.240> springer<00:05:46.720> it

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
um I modified my hook on my springer it
