that<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.979> defensive<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.610> he

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that you want as the defensive back he

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
that you want as the defensive back he
played<00:01:09.060> corner<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> both<00:01:10.080> safety<00:01:10.770> spots<00:01:11.070> I

played corner and both safety spots I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.320 
played corner and both safety spots I
think<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> great<00:01:11.970> selection

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
think this would be a great selection

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
think this would be a great selection
for<00:01:12.900> Baltimore<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.350> second<00:01:19.710> round<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.890> look

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
for Baltimore in the second round I look

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
for Baltimore in the second round I look
at<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> ravens<00:01:20.610> being<00:01:20.850> able<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.270> select<00:01:21.630> one

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
at the ravens being able to select one

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
at the ravens being able to select one
of<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.900> favorite<00:01:22.320> prospects<00:01:22.920> linebacker

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of my favorite prospects linebacker

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
of my favorite prospects linebacker
author<00:01:23.850> Brown<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:24.659> lists<00:01:24.869> him<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.110> an

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
author Brown some lists him as an

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
author Brown some lists him as an
outside<00:01:25.680> linebacker<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> play

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
outside linebacker I think he can play

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
outside linebacker I think he can play
on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.080> interior<00:01:28.500> especially<00:01:29.220> behind

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on the interior especially behind

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
on the interior especially behind
hollowly<00:01:29.909> nada<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> love<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.110> he<00:01:31.290> plays<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
hollowly nada I love the way he plays a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
hollowly nada I love the way he plays a
game<00:01:31.890> attacks<00:01:32.280> downhill<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.000> brings<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> lot

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of speed to the position when analyzing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
of speed to the position when analyzing
the<00:01:41.759> Ravens<00:01:42.150> roster<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.869> Torrey<00:01:43.200> Smith

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the Ravens roster you see Torrey Smith

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and a bunch of guys at wide receiver so

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210 
and a bunch of guys at wide receiver so
they<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.350> upgrade<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> why

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
