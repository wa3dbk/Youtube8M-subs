00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.460 

and<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.770> jump<00:04:13.069> back<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.959> tannoy<00:04:15.700> now<00:04:17.139> if<00:04:18.139> white

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
and you jump back to tannoy now if white

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.099 
and you jump back to tannoy now if white
goes<00:04:18.709> here<00:04:18.980> 19<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.820> 15<00:04:20.239> would<00:04:20.720> just<00:04:20.930> take<00:04:21.079> a

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
goes here 19 to 15 would just take a

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.470 
goes here 19 to 15 would just take a
look<00:04:21.410> at<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:22.100> would<00:04:22.310> cut<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.060> lot<00:04:23.389> of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
look at that you would cut a lot of

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.970 
look at that you would cut a lot of
times<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:23.960> position<00:04:24.500> that's<00:04:24.650> what<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
times in this position that's what you

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.629 
times in this position that's what you
do<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.340> would<00:04:25.460> go<00:04:25.550> 16<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.240> 19<00:04:26.680> white<00:04:27.680> jumps<00:04:28.010> 23

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
do you would go 16 to 19 white jumps 23

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.470 
do you would go 16 to 19 white jumps 23
to<00:04:28.760> 16<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.870> jump<00:04:30.169> 12<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.980> 19<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.910> then<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.270> say

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
to 16 you jump 12 to 19 and then you say

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.080 
to 16 you jump 12 to 19 and then you say
well<00:04:32.690> he<00:04:32.870> can<00:04:33.020> squeeze<00:04:33.260> me<00:04:33.590> by<00:04:33.740> going<00:04:33.980> 27<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.760> 23

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
well he can squeeze me by going 27 to 23

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.560 
well he can squeeze me by going 27 to 23
and<00:04:35.480> win<00:04:35.960> my<00:04:36.139> check<00:04:36.410> when<00:04:37.250> he<00:04:37.310> goes<00:04:37.460> 27<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.240> 23

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
and win my check when he goes 27 to 23

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.409 
and win my check when he goes 27 to 23
all<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.440> need<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.770> do<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.010> go<00:04:40.160> 7<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.820> 11<00:04:40.850> and

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
all you need to do is go 7 to 11 and

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.270 
all you need to do is go 7 to 11 and
either<00:04:42.290> way<00:04:42.440> he<00:04:42.590> jumps<00:04:43.479> he<00:04:44.479> jumps<00:04:44.840> here<00:04:45.350> to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
either way he jumps he jumps here to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.180 
either way he jumps he jumps here to
jump<00:04:46.580> see<00:04:46.729> yeah<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.030> would<00:04:47.300> jump<00:04:47.510> from<00:04:47.750> 3<00:04:48.190> back

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
jump see yeah you would jump from 3 back

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.690 
jump see yeah you would jump from 3 back
to<00:04:49.490> 19<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.870> 2<00:04:51.050> jumps<00:04:51.380> also<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.400> that's

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
to 19 for 2 jumps also so that's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.370 
to 19 for 2 jumps also so that's
something<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.030> can<00:04:53.300> look<00:04:53.419> at<00:04:53.660> but<00:04:54.169> that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
something you can look at but that

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.230 
something you can look at but that
happens<00:04:55.070> too<00:04:55.160> often<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:55.550> White<00:04:55.700> has<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.910> better

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
happens too often but White has a better

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.530 
happens too often but White has a better
