00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
look through each position filter out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
look through each position filter out
the<00:01:33.060> lowest<00:01:33.210> by<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> eventually<00:01:34.590> you're

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the lowest by now and eventually you're

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
the lowest by now and eventually you're
gonna<00:01:34.950> find<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.430> deal<00:01:35.610> eventually<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.299> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
gonna find a deal eventually you just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
gonna find a deal eventually you just
have<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.689> keep<00:01:36.840> doing<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.820> i

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
have to keep doing this and you know i

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
have to keep doing this and you know i
just<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.329> once<00:01:39.570> every<00:01:39.840> couple<00:01:39.990> hours<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just do this once every couple hours and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.670 
just do this once every couple hours and
so<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.759> la<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.229> sped<00:01:43.530> up

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so this is just la you know just sped up

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
so this is just la you know just sped up
but<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.250> exactly<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.820> i<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.000> doing

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
but this is exactly what i was doing

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
but this is exactly what i was doing
just<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.720> sped<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just a little bit sped up and and the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
just a little bit sped up and and the
reason<00:01:48.210> silver<00:01:48.509> players<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> in

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
also and then we were checking the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.740 
also and then we were checking the
Gold's<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> always<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
Gold's because you always want to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.490 
Gold's because you always want to
confirm<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.170> gold

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
confirm the gold

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.260 
confirm the gold
and<00:02:13.620> there's<00:02:14.040> no<00:02:14.190> cheaper<00:02:14.550> goal<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.060> damn

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and there's no cheaper goal for damn

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.850 
and there's no cheaper goal for damn
sure<00:02:15.300> right<00:02:15.750> there<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.500> we're<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> go

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
sure right there so we're going to go

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860 
sure right there so we're going to go
ahead<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.400> back<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.850> list<00:02:18.420> them<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.720> for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
ahead go back out and list them up for

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.840 
ahead go back out and list them up for
just<00:02:19.260> under<00:02:19.500> um<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.770> under<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.190> next<00:02:23.490> Louis

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
just under um just under the next Louis

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.280 
just under um just under the next Louis
by<00:02:24.150> now<00:02:24.390> which<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:24.960> thousand<00:02:25.230> coins

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
by now which was two thousand coins

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.390 
by now which was two thousand coins
we're<00:02:25.470> gonna<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.010> eighteen

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we're gonna put on the eighteen

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.860 
we're gonna put on the eighteen
hundred<00:02:26.640> coins<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.240> he<00:02:27.270> flips<00:02:27.720> he

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
hundred coins so that way he flips he

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.420 
hundred coins so that way he flips he
sells<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.650> that's<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.070> thousand<00:02:29.370> coins

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
sells and and that's a thousand coins

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.860 
sells and and that's a thousand coins
profit<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> put<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.510> bought<00:02:30.660> them<00:02:30.750> for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
profit if you put if you bought them for

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.360 
profit if you put if you bought them for
seven<00:02:31.080> hundred<00:02:31.200> put<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.770> for<00:02:31.800> 18<00:02:32.160> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
seven hundred put them up for 18 you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.910 
seven hundred put them up for 18 you
just<00:02:32.520> made<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> thousand<00:02:32.970> coins<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just made a thousand coins and the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.580 
just made a thousand coins and the
reasoning<00:02:35.610> behind<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.180> method<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.350> thought

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
reasoning behind this method the thought

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.130 
reasoning behind this method the thought
process<00:02:38.040> behind<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.520> method<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.270> it's<00:02:39.600> not

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
process behind this method is it's not

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.760 
process behind this method is it's not
to<00:02:40.410> find<00:02:40.740> one<00:02:41.190> big<00:02:41.610> Buy<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.350> flip<00:02:43.590> them<00:02:43.740> for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
to find one big Buy and to flip them for

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.590 
to find one big Buy and to flip them for
a<00:02:43.950> lot<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.190> coins<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.580> too<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.390> find

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
a lot of coins is too but it's to find

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.050 
a lot of coins is too but it's to find
multiple<00:02:46.080> players<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:47.400> flip<00:02:47.640> them<00:02:47.790> for

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
multiple players and just flip them for

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180 
multiple players and just flip them for

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
then we got to check the gold just to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.830 
then we got to check the gold just to
make<00:03:08.220> sure<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> gold<00:03:08.880> isn't<00:03:09.120> gonna<00:03:09.360> you

know<00:03:09.959> conflict<00:03:10.709> with<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.100> silver<00:03:11.400> card<00:03:11.730> but

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
know conflict with the silver card but

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.350 
know conflict with the silver card but
the<00:03:13.560> thought<00:03:14.010> process<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.060> sell

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the thought process is that if you sell

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.600 
the thought process is that if you sell
for<00:03:15.930> five<00:03:16.410> cards<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> thousand<00:03:17.489> coins
