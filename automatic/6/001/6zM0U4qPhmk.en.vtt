00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.100
 hi my dragon city players like 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.870
 are I diego in this team of 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.490
 trailers a video about the event that 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.099
 came out on ios and android devices 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.349
 As you know, it went to Dyno Island but 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.360
 now it's not the island said all 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.219
 we knew where they gave only the one 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.170
 booked others opened this island and we 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.449
 it's improved if you know here 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 they added two new sections which is the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.410
 habitat of the dinos and of course 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.660
 dragon pterodactyl now yes 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.130
 homogenized all the dragons to their 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.320
 earth element that is going to be main 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.379
 of the event so the t-rex is no longer 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.360
 electric but now it's going to be earth 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.500
 so well let's see what it is that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.810
 the event asks us 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 As we can see the first section 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.090
 it's about forum we have to pay gold for 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 my island can be said that the more section 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 easy of all so good at once 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.660
 I'm going to pay all of drawers about 4 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.890
 the second part is about these strangers 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.629
 these clans that get in the world 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.449
 of battles fighting on the islands of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.250
 combat and for every battle canada them 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 they give a skull and so they have to do them 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240
 decant the four in the three 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.610
 sections 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.040
 and well we come to the third section 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.320
 than about two-hour bottles each 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.240
 one and well I think that there 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.640
 they reported that you propose me the book 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.520
 achieve that you have weakness before the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.380
 land and ice so let's go to 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.000
 look for a dragon that meets these 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.289
 qualities because I think it freed the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.970
 plants so I can analyze well 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.120
 that we are going to catch the good friend poker 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.530
 dragon 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.920
 plus 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 the dragon and metal candles I forgot to 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.340
 metal and love because I am earth 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.460
 do not do it I think they did not do it anymore 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.170
 but well I did go through this situation 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.000
 so those who have not done so do not pass 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.410
 because of this you already know that it is metal 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.970
 choose a land an ice as a 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.300
 main event professionals is going to be 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.970
 critical 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.689
 well let's go to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.700
 forward for two limits two we press 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.430
 let's choose the good friend clubbers 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.220
 dragon that can not be critical 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.450

 know how to choose which dragon 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.610
 and analyzes in its second element for 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.260
 that they catch us a dragon that can 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.569
 be critical for your second the event to
