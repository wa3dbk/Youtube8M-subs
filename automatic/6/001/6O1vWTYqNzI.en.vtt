00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
first let me tell you what Wi-Fi direct

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.790 
first let me tell you what Wi-Fi direct
is<00:00:35.780> Wi-Fi<00:00:36.560> direct<00:00:36.890> is<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:38.390> is<00:00:38.660> used<00:00:38.989> in<00:00:39.260> sbeam

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
is Wi-Fi direct is it is used in sbeam

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.729 
is Wi-Fi direct is it is used in sbeam
at<00:00:40.010> times<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:42.020> can<00:00:42.170> actually<00:00:42.290> use<00:00:42.620> it

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
at times but you can actually use it

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.770 
at times but you can actually use it
without<00:00:43.010> using<00:00:43.250> sbeam<00:00:43.820> SPM<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.540> course

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
without using sbeam SPM is of course

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.020 
without using sbeam SPM is of course
when<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.050> put<00:00:45.200> these<00:00:45.320> two<00:00:45.560> phones<00:00:45.770> together

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
when you put these two phones together

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.150 
when you put these two phones together
tap<00:00:47.030> them<00:00:47.239> side-by-side<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.260> they<00:00:48.680> vibrate

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
tap them side-by-side and they vibrate

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.870 
tap them side-by-side and they vibrate
to<00:00:49.399> send<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.790> file<00:00:49.970> over<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.480> each<00:00:50.690> other<00:00:50.899> now

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
to send a file over to each other now

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.860 
to send a file over to each other now
but<00:00:52.880> say<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.120> know<00:00:53.360> if<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.630> don't<00:00:53.720> really

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870

know if you want to keep them separate

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.350 
know if you want to keep them separate
what<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.700> can<00:00:58.820> do<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.059> something<00:00:59.239> called

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
what you can do is something called

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.990 
what you can do is something called
Wi-Fi<00:00:59.660> direct<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.320> Wi-Fi<00:01:00.649> direct<00:01:00.860> can<00:01:01.670> be<00:01:01.850> as

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
Wi-Fi direct and Wi-Fi direct can be as

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.289 
Wi-Fi direct and Wi-Fi direct can be as
far<00:01:02.239> as<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.660> regular<00:01:03.079> Wi-Fi<00:01:03.260> connection<00:01:03.950> and

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
far as a regular Wi-Fi connection and

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.819 
far as a regular Wi-Fi connection and
what<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.420> does<00:01:05.630> is<00:01:05.899> it<00:01:06.079> does<00:01:06.259> not<00:01:06.290> use

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
what this does is it does not use

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.550 
what this does is it does not use
internet<00:01:07.700> or<00:01:07.880> 4G<00:01:08.479> or<00:01:08.509> anything<00:01:08.869> like<00:01:09.049> that<00:01:09.139> it

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
internet or 4G or anything like that it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.059 
internet or 4G or anything like that it
just<00:01:09.920> sends<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.030> Wi-Fi<00:01:11.689> connection<00:01:11.749> to<00:01:12.740> both

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
just sends a Wi-Fi connection to both

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.580 
just sends a Wi-Fi connection to both
one<00:01:13.459> sending<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.030> one<00:01:14.119> receiving<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.869> they

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
one sending and one receiving and they

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.649 
one sending and one receiving and they
can<00:01:15.740> do<00:01:15.829> this<00:01:15.979> simultaneously<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.880> course<00:01:17.299> oh

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
can do this simultaneously of course oh

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.569 
can do this simultaneously of course oh
you<00:01:18.109> know<00:01:18.229> one<00:01:18.590> can<00:01:18.740> switch<00:01:18.950> with<00:01:19.189> one<00:01:19.399> can

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
you know one can switch with one can

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.129 
you know one can switch with one can
switch<00:01:19.789> receiving<00:01:20.270> one<00:01:20.450> consider<00:01:20.840> sending

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
switch receiving one consider sending

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.789 
switch receiving one consider sending
back<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.219> forth<00:01:22.459> and<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.569> can<00:01:23.719> send<00:01:24.020> very

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
back and forth and you can send very

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.029 
back and forth and you can send very
large<00:01:25.130> files<00:01:25.549> over<00:01:25.929> seconds<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.319> that's<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
white right here it would be Wi-Fi

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.999 
white right here it would be Wi-Fi
direct<00:01:47.450> okay<00:01:48.139> so<00:01:48.200> we're<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.889> turn

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
direct okay so we're just going to turn

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.870 
direct okay so we're just going to turn
that<00:01:49.159> on<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.889> slide<00:01:51.889> like<00:01:52.069> that<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.639> now<00:01:52.789> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.089 
that on and slide like that so now that
Wi-Fi<00:01:53.359> direct<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:53.719> on<00:01:53.840> here<00:01:54.079> but<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.799> needs<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
Wi-Fi direct is on here but it needs to

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.580 
Wi-Fi direct is on here but it needs to
find<00:01:55.340> another<00:01:55.579> Wi-Fi<00:01:56.029> direct<00:01:56.240> device<00:01:56.539> so<00:01:57.349> how

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
find another Wi-Fi direct device so how

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.349 
find another Wi-Fi direct device so how
you<00:01:57.649> do<00:01:57.889> it<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> note<00:01:58.609> I'm<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.209> zoom

you do it on the note I'm going to zoom
in<00:01:59.389> a<00:01:59.539> little<00:01:59.630> bit<00:01:59.840> more<00:02:00.049> for<00:02:00.319> you<00:02:00.439> guys<00:02:00.649> is

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
in a little bit more for you guys is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.760 
in a little bit more for you guys is
still<00:02:02.299> through<00:02:02.509> settings<00:02:02.989> right<00:02:03.319> here<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.679> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
still through settings right here at the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.419 
still through settings right here at the
bottom<00:02:05.020> but<00:02:06.020> now<00:02:06.139> you<00:02:06.200> actually<00:02:06.469> go<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.829> Wi-Fi

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
bottom but now you actually go to Wi-Fi

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.690 
bottom but now you actually go to Wi-Fi
and<00:02:08.289> then<00:02:09.289> at<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> very<00:02:09.679> bottom<00:02:09.920> right<00:02:10.280> it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and then at the very bottom right it's

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.510 
and then at the very bottom right it's
Wi-Fi<00:02:11.300> direct<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.710> little<00:02:12.950> touch<00:02:13.130> up<00:02:13.370> a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
Wi-Fi direct so it's a little touch up a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.670 
Wi-Fi direct so it's a little touch up a
little<00:02:13.730> bit<00:02:13.850> different<00:02:14.300> but<00:02:14.600> that's<00:02:15.380> what

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
little bit different but that's what

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.770 
little bit different but that's what
they<00:02:15.800> changed<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
they changed it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.220 
they changed it
or<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.860> now<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> find<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.000> s3<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.690> here<00:02:20.020> so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
or and then now I find the s3 on here so

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.420 
or and then now I find the s3 on here so
I'm<00:02:20.319> going<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> connect<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.250> they

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I'm going to connect to it and they

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.490 
I'm going to connect to it and they
found<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.819> note<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.780> connecting

just<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.590> little<00:02:29.620> example<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.670> how<00:02:30.910> quickly

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
just a little example of how quickly

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.850 
just a little example of how quickly
something<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.930> transfer<00:02:32.380> through<00:02:32.680> Wi-Fi

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
something and transfer through Wi-Fi

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.010 
something and transfer through Wi-Fi
direct<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.390> transfer<00:02:34.780> over<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
direct so I'm going to transfer over a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:44.760 
direct so I'm going to transfer over a
video<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.680> my<00:02:36.330> s3<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.840> video<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.709> about

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
video on my s3 and this video is about

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.410 
video on my s3 and this video is about
three<00:02:45.670> minutes<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.400> hold<00:02:49.239> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
three minutes and I'm going to hold it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.400 
three minutes and I'm going to hold it
down<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.959> say<00:02:50.230> share<00:02:50.590> via<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:52.630> Wi-Fi

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
down and say share via and then Wi-Fi

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.340 
down and say share via and then Wi-Fi
direct<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.630> then<00:02:55.630> I'm<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.200> my

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
direct and then I'm going to see my

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.949 
direct and then I'm going to see my
galaxy<00:02:56.800> note<00:02:56.830> here<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> will<00:02:58.090> click<00:02:58.630> done

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
galaxy note here so I will click done

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.820 
galaxy note here so I will click done
and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.019> will<00:03:02.140> start<00:03:02.380> saying<00:03:02.650> I'm

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
and then it will start saying I'm

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.900 
and then it will start saying I'm
receiving<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.430> video<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.920> will<00:03:06.040> see<00:03:06.340> just

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
receiving a video and you will see just

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.770 
receiving a video and you will see just
how<00:03:07.090> quickly<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:09.390> sends<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.730> very<00:03:13.120> quick<00:03:13.510> as

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
how quickly that sends so very quick as

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.140 
how quickly that sends so very quick as
you<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.319> see<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.890> three<00:03:15.160> minutes<00:03:15.340> now

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you can see that was three minutes now

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.630 
you can see that was three minutes now
let's<00:03:16.300> go<00:03:16.450> for<00:03:16.720> something<00:03:17.019> longer<00:03:17.290> let's<00:03:18.280> go

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
let's go for something longer let's go

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.039 
let's go for something longer let's go
for<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.959> 20<00:03:20.799> minute<00:03:21.130> video<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.900> guys

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
for a 20 minute video just so you guys

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.740 
for a 20 minute video just so you guys
can<00:03:23.110> really<00:03:23.620> see<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.980> difference<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.750> I'm

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
can really see the difference so I'm

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.600 
can really see the difference so I'm
going<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:25.989> send<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.440> copy<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.130> Big<00:03:27.400> Bang

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
going to send a copy of this Big Bang

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.780 
going to send a copy of this Big Bang
Theory<00:03:28.030> episode<00:03:28.390> I'm<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.079> hold<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.350> down

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
Theory episode I'm going to hold it down

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:38.520 
Theory episode I'm going to hold it down
share<00:03:30.790> via<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:32.320> Wi-Fi<00:03:33.250> direct<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
share via and Wi-Fi direct and just to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.650 
share via and Wi-Fi direct and just to
give<00:03:38.620> an<00:03:38.709> idea<00:03:38.920> how<00:03:39.100> big<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.730> file<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.269> let's

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
give an idea how big this file is let's

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.020 
give an idea how big this file is let's
go<00:03:40.810> check<00:03:41.019> details<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:44.380> file<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:45.040> 175

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
go check details and this file is 175

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.060 
go check details and this file is 175
megabytes<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:46.840> let's<00:03:47.079> see<00:03:47.200> how<00:03:47.320> long<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.920> takes

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
megabytes so let's see how long it takes

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.880 
megabytes so let's see how long it takes
175<00:03:49.000> megabytes<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.510> transfer<00:03:49.989> over<00:03:50.079> via<00:03:50.650> Wi-Fi

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
175 megabytes to transfer over via Wi-Fi

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.979 
175 megabytes to transfer over via Wi-Fi
direct<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> far<00:03:56.650> we're<00:03:56.859> already<00:03:57.010> at<00:03:57.190> 40%

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
direct and so far we're already at 40%

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.509 
direct and so far we're already at 40%
there's<00:03:58.989> any<00:03:59.170> one<00:03:59.290> time<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.920> didn't

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
there's any one time in this I didn't

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.750 
there's any one time in this I didn't
time<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.100> see<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.400> very

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
time it but as you can see it very

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.699 
time it but as you can see it very
quickly<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.390> easy<00:04:04.720> not<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.140> be<00:04:05.200> anywhere<00:04:05.470> near

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
quickly and easy not to be anywhere near

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.110 
quickly and easy not to be anywhere near
each<00:04:05.769> other<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.370> can<00:04:06.579> be<00:04:06.670> like<00:04:06.880> in

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
each other like this can be like in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.970 
each other like this can be like in
somewhere<00:04:07.810> else<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.350> doesn't<00:04:08.560> matter<00:04:08.799> in

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
somewhere else it doesn't matter in

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.099 
somewhere else it doesn't matter in
another<00:04:09.190> room<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.510> will<00:04:10.690> still<00:04:10.930> be<00:04:11.049> able

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
another room and it will still be able

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.840 
another room and it will still be able
to<00:04:11.260> connect<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.829> strong<00:04:12.130> as<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.459> Wi-Fi

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
to connect it's as strong as your Wi-Fi

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.400 
to connect it's as strong as your Wi-Fi
signal<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.370> can<00:04:15.700> transfer<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
signal is so it you can transfer the
