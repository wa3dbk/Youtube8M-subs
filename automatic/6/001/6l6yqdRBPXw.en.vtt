00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 the opposite of fables is one to the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 min min min trend what is it 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.380
 it is the declination of a flagship on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.469
 a much more compact format we saw 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.780
 on the s4 on the wan hey ben there we have the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.780
 mini g2 that we will discover together 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 then minimally especially name because in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 terms of congestion 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.210
 we are still not far from the g2 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.730
 classic the g2 it's 5 5 2 inches this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 g2 mini cdu 4.7 inches here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 the clutter it is still enough 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 near no mini especially with respect to the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 configuration and pricing in terms of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.149
 configuration one is obviously far from 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 our classic g 2 there we are on a 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 little snapdragon in quad core we are on 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 a 4.7-inch screen with a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.350
 lower definition 960 by 540 pixels 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.690
 we are beyond the full hd 1 on the g2 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 we are also less efficient on the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.090
 capture photo 8 mega on the back we have 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 still 4g in category 4 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.470
 is still on the android 4.4 kit kat 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 we have this new system of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.240
 unlocking snop code that has it's 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.330
 pretty cool I find at lg 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 we are mostly on a product going over 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.590
 accessible it says I have two mini 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.380
 it's especially in relation to the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.920
 spec is the target 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.619
 at lg we want to target people who 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 have a stock market a little less garni than 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.009
 their parents so here we are on a 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 product to be offered at 2.99 299 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.439
 euros to support the 8 giga internally 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.390
 we have a fleet for memory card 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.430
 microsd his classics 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.630
 we have a micro sim and then the battery 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.640
 removable 2440 milliamps min on the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.189
 configuration also we have a small weight 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.250
 from core snapdragon 400 it is clocked at 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.410
 1,2 ghz war will be a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 5 gigas of ram for could for 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.009
 support this little loved ones normally 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.870
 for most uses it should 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.730
 to be largely sufficient but one is 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.990
 still far enough from the big brother 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.990
 snapdragon 800
