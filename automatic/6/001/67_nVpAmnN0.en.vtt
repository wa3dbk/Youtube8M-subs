00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
something that really felt natural today
I<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> guitar<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.659> songs<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I think the guitar at the right songs I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
I think the guitar at the right songs I
wanted<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> write<00:01:17.010> tunes<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.120> point<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
wanted to write tunes at that point I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.960 
wanted to write tunes at that point I
was<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> late<00:01:18.810> bloomer<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.409> music<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
was a late bloomer and the music because

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
was a late bloomer and the music because
well<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> knew<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.930> dad<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.290> minister

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
music but even take me I've seen Johnny

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.920 
music but even take me I've seen Johnny
Cash<00:01:24.950> Elton<00:01:25.950> John<00:01:26.190> Keane<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.780> more

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Cash Elton John Keane so it was more

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.700 
Cash Elton John Keane so it was more
song<00:01:28.260> bass<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> wasn't<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.550> know<00:01:30.710> not

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
song bass it wasn't like you know not

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.469 
song bass it wasn't like you know not
the<00:01:31.890> Johnny<00:01:32.310> Cash<00:01:32.520> can't<00:01:32.760> play<00:01:32.880> guitar<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the Johnny Cash can't play guitar you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.760 
the Johnny Cash can't play guitar you
couldn't<00:01:33.750> think<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.960> harder<00:01:34.200> great<00:01:34.440> guitars

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

couldn't think it's harder great guitars
but<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.400> song<00:01:35.700> based<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.750> that's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
but it was more song based so that's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.180

there's<00:02:28.090> some<00:02:28.239> kind<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> weird<00:02:28.600> harmonic<00:02:29.260> that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
there's some kind of weird harmonic that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.560 
there's some kind of weird harmonic that
just<00:02:30.010> makes<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.489> sound<00:02:30.670> real<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.239> like<00:02:31.360> it's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it's happening then so it played a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.309 
it's happening then so it played a
really<00:02:35.530> big<00:02:35.830> part<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.540> next<00:02:37.810> collective

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
soul right you'll hear it on that and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.240 
soul right you'll hear it on that and
then<00:02:40.540> always<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.260> Bigsby<00:02:41.709> which<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.069> knowing

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
then always the Bigsby which is knowing

way<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.890> hit<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> wrong<00:02:45.250> note<00:02:45.489> I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
way if I do really hit the wrong note I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.250

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I think it's gonna be a little bit more

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.850 
I think it's gonna be a little bit more

just<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:24.050> his<00:03:24.200> energy<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.560> he's<00:03:24.710> around<00:03:25.010> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
just like his energy and he's around and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.410 
just like his energy and he's around and
he's<00:03:25.370> actually<00:03:25.550> someone<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.180> kind<00:03:26.390> of

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
right so I think I've wrote it in like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.850 
right so I think I've wrote it in like
three<00:03:30.650> days

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
three days

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.590 
three days
the<00:03:31.100> music<00:03:31.400> part<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.180> then<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.450> once

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the music part of it and then just once

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.060 
the music part of it and then just once
it<00:03:32.720> gets<00:03:32.870> going<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.230> gets<00:03:33.260> going<00:03:33.500> last<00:03:33.800> when<00:03:34.040> I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it gets going it gets going last when I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.130 
it gets going it gets going last when I
did<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.580> know<00:03:34.700> over<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.330> lot<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.960> vodka
