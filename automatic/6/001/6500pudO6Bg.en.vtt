00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.370
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.019
 crocker here we are in a new video 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.030
 of news after a few days 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.920
 let's go over two pretty news 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.200
 important especially the first one that 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.480
 is about a possible new skin the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220
 rumble that we will review is news 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.930
 official so well let's go over to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 below and we will also talk about 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.240
 content of patch 4.4 that appears 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.710
 tomorrow on the main server at 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.509
 long tonight will be available 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.239
 so let's start with the new 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.769
 skin the rumble on the official page of the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.020
 ico play ens a few minutes ago they just 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.850
 publish a new story in which 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.500
 title the hero of a fallen city and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.780
 we see this image what appears to be 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.489
 rumble good if you look at it has the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.809
 lighter with the flamethrower and the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.180
 appearance from rumble therefore 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.120
 we are before an image of it 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.620
 champion tell you that inside the news 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 there is also a text that says how could 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 be a hero if I can not protect them there 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.809
 to keep in mind certain things there 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 people who think they are a new champion 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.260
 there are people who say that it is a skin of 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.670
 rumble others that is a visual improvement I 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.590
 I think it's going to be a visual improvement 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.899
 accompanied by a new skin you know 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.569
 which is the champion that according to his output 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.860
 as it came out he received two skins from that 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.140
 era was coming 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.750
 with two skins all the champions and not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.400
 has received none therefore it is already 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.840
 time for a corner to fall 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 champion and that you visually touch up 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.270
 they modified the fire a few weeks ago 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 the textures of fire you already know and good 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.160
 tell you that they have left a small 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.350
 spoiler at the time of the path 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.360
 on the American website in the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 which puts skin preview therefore we 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 suggests that it is a skin accompanied 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.050
 of a visual improvement because because if 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 you count and follow the news of 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.430
 channel a long time ago that the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.990
 game designers said they were not going 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.580
 to remove any skin from rumble until 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 need a visual improvement of it 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.020
 therefore if we look also at 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.390
 the website appears a phrase that says 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.000
 the following this is not the end it 's time 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 of an improvement highlighted the improvement 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 I will teach what Jordan is made of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.610
 so it seems that everything paints a 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.830
 visual improvement accompanied by a corner 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.070
 we will be attentive in the channel from 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.080
 tomorrow, the 4.4 is activated 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.850
 new patch therefore also 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.070
 a new cycle starts on the pp server 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.230
 and this makes more news appear 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.740
 we can see maybe this rumble skin 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 with the 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.820
 to avenge you do not know we will be attentive and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.140
 if you want all the news you know 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.090
 what is your channel so 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.790
 Let's continue now with the review of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.790
 patch 4.4 good here you have all the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.230
 content of the patch 4.4 tell you that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
 changes in the champions not yet the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.560
 I added more than anything because I do not know 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.850
 they still know everything until they are 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.160
 in the patch notes that will be 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.210
 tomorrow or tonight we can not talk 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.590
 clear about those changes that maybe 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.140
 come out some things that are not in the in 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.220
 the server pp or maybe it's different 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.230
 so let's wait a little bit until 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.090
 have it clearer to tell you that you can 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.670
 navigate through any of the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.700
 content of patch 4.4 for was his 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.140
 corresponding video either the skin of 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 arctic operation varus the skin that 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 we are seeing that I suppose it is a 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.900
 price of 975 riot points also the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 visual improvement of heimerdinger that has 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.590
 received changes in the skins the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.600
 particle changes in the icons of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.460
 invoker new places new history 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.870
 if you want to see all that you can do 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.940
 click if you have activated the annotations 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.230
 you can also see the new effects 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.670
 visuals in summoner spells 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.340
 such as, for example, barrier 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.320
 teleport and turn on the also the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.760
 improvements in velcros textures for 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.950
 make it look a little clearer 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.989
 with new particles in the q the cove 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.340
 mouse and perhaps the possible record of 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.590
 dyn home skills that also 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.290
 you will have access to the video and tell you that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 the best is not added in this patch 4.4 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.319
 We'll have to wait and see because 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.760
 you know that sometimes on the baby server 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.829
 they are modifying a long time 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.450
 champion and then really do not take it out 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.079
 so good as is the case of renting 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.420
 for patch 4.5 maybe we'll see the skin 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.090
 of abseiling we might also see 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.459
 changes in rain garde and his skin who 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 know we will be attentive and for all of them 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.579
