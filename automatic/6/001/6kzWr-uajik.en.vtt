organic farm let me get rid of this
music<00:00:05.339> actually<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:07.490> was<00:00:08.490> starting<00:00:08.790> over<00:00:09.260> we

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
music actually I was starting over we

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.130 
music actually I was starting over we
don't<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:12.590> but<00:00:13.590> today's<00:00:17.840> 29th

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
don't have but today's 29th

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.650 
don't have but today's 29th
I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:23.330> provider<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.519> I<00:00:26.519> only<00:00:27.359> grow<00:00:27.510> these

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
I think provider and I only grow these

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.240 
I think provider and I only grow these
in<00:00:27.840> these<00:00:27.930> high<00:00:28.109> tunnels<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.130> have

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
in these high tunnels because we have

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
in these high tunnels because we have
too<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:29.849> air<00:00:30.119> pressure<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.540> yield<00:00:33.690> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
too much air pressure and the yield is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.160 
too much air pressure and the yield is
just<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.290> nicer<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.160> high<00:00:35.370> tunnels

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.770 

provider<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.969> they<00:00:41.969> resistant<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
provider and they resistant to some of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
provider and they resistant to some of
the<00:00:42.870> diseases<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.670> issues

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the diseases but we do have some issues

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.350 
the diseases but we do have some issues
in<00:00:45.239> other<00:00:45.360> places<00:00:46.070> but<00:00:47.070> we've<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.550> seed<00:00:47.850> these

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
in other places but we've we seed these

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.950 
in other places but we've we seed these
beans<00:00:48.600> every<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.079> weeks<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:50.660> lines<00:00:51.660> like

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
beans every two weeks for lines like

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.830 
beans every two weeks for lines like
this<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:55.789> we<00:00:56.789> harvest<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.660> about

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
this and we harvest from then for about

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
this and we harvest from then for about
two<00:00:58.020> weeks<00:00:58.230> sometimes<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.309> more

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
two weeks sometimes a little bit more

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.150 
two weeks sometimes a little bit more
some<00:00:59.699> time<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.030> less<00:01:00.500> then<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> bent<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
some time for less then the bent on the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.820 
some time for less then the bent on the
wheat<00:01:02.340> pressure<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.660> then

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
wheat pressure and all that and then

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.969 
wheat pressure and all that and then
it's<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.250> good<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.990> pull<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.710> crop

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's also really good to pull for crop

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.560 
it's also really good to pull for crop
rotation<00:01:08.520> since<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> legume<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> yeah

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
rotation since it's a legume and so yeah

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.370 
rotation since it's a legume and so yeah
basically<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:14.390> mid<00:01:15.390> mid<00:01:15.840> spring<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
basically from mid mid spring all the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
basically from mid mid spring all the
way<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:17.330> late<00:01:18.330> summer<00:01:18.770> every<00:01:19.770> two<00:01:19.950> weeks<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.520> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
way to late summer every two weeks so we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.870 
way to late summer every two weeks so we
have<00:01:21.119> green<00:01:21.390> beans<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:22.140> every<00:01:22.439> week

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
have green beans pretty much every week

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
have green beans pretty much every week
for<00:01:23.880> half<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> year<00:01:24.210> inside<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.259> high

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
for half a year inside these high

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.609 
for half a year inside these high
tunnels<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.119> here<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.240> go

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
tunnels and so here we go

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
tunnels and so here we go
do<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.770> sell<00:01:31.979> well<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> market<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.850> well

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
kinds of beans to be grown I don't like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.950 
kinds of beans to be grown I don't like
to<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> pull<00:01:46.200> beans<00:01:46.490> because<00:01:47.840> they<00:01:48.840> just

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
to do to pull beans because they just

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.749 
to do to pull beans because they just
don't<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.740> locate<00:01:49.860> harvested<00:01:50.490> I'd<00:01:50.640> have

been long enough to really warrant the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.859 
been long enough to really warrant the
whole<00:01:53.220> trellising<00:01:53.700> system<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.509> these<00:01:54.630> little

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
whole trellising system but these little

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
whole trellising system but these little
bush<00:01:55.020> beans<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.590> we've<00:01:55.770> picked<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.219> three

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
bush beans here we've picked you three

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
bush beans here we've picked you three
weeks<00:01:56.579> they're<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
weeks they're out of it it's good for

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
weeks they're out of it it's good for
our<00:01:58.439> crop<00:01:58.740> rotation<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> pretty

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
our crop rotation and this is a pretty

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.369 
our crop rotation and this is a pretty
good<00:02:00.810> stand<00:02:01.130> pretty<00:02:02.130> good
