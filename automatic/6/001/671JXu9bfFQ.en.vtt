00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 forget auschwitz that's the name of the book 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.850
 here is the author henryk m brother good 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.850
 morning 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.620
 that's why, thanks in the post 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.330
 They are known as provocateur love 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 The dispute is also the dispute 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 provocation be it this title 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 forget that Auschwitz is one too 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 provocation no it is completely serious 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.199
 I'm not a provocateur 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
 if something provocative it is that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 Reality and I play it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 actually only if that as a provocation 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.619
 I can not feel anything then 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.070
 for this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.969
 they write there are 120 in germany 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 holocaust commemorative brother now live 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.170
 you in germany what would be going on here 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 if you would follow their advice and only 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 close one of these memorials 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.829
 you would probably look around 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.789
 open two new ones 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.110
 no, it would probably be nothing 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.649
 Schlussmann tell this ritual 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.480
 you know, there is such a thing 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.460
 morbid love for dead jews and the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 dead you are the better you have them 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.609
 if they do not control 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 and that was what I think after the war 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 Not at all because both 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 Parties probably needed 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.770
 to grasp what had happened 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.640
 and somehow a '60s' 70s 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 set memorial ribbon as 40 50 years 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 operate 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.540
 then you will not come from this horse 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.020
 why there and meanwhile I hold that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.210
 everything counterproductive from Rheinbach 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.090
 but maybe that's her beard like that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 quickly as you have in the book 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.939
 Quote written we can do the hand 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 micro take if they speak in there 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.880
 like to write a quote where they do that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.710
 to summarize what I am right now 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 I have said, quote 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.450
 I am not interested in dead Jews 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.970
 was once in Auschwitz and can anyone 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 from visiting this open air museum only 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.540
 dissuade and elsewhere 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.570
 they mention that their own 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.740
 grandparents quote brother in smoke 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600
 have risen 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 Mr. Broder, you are interested in the dead 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 Jews who are their own ancestors 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.750
 really not 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.130
 we all know what happened there 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.840
 probably no epoch in the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 similar to human history 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.740
 been thoroughly documented again 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.659
 holocaust and no place of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
 Thoroughly documented where the Auschwitz 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.140
 and what I'm doing today in Auschwitz 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 is just about scenes 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.590
 you see the tourists come 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660
 photograph yourself in this arch 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 work makes you free then sit down like that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.459
 pack next to the collapsed gas chamber 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.890
 make their steal and hold second there 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.629
 breakfast that has nothing to commemorate 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.459
 doing is a scary cabinet 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.540
 but I would still accept that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.299
 that would not bother me so much 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.799
 disturb because the old one kind 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.750
 KÃ¶nigswinter with ns connection became 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.840
 is what bothers me then is that about it 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.970
 In addition, what happens today is low 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.400
 it is estimated or overlooked 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.530
 There are massive threats of Iranian 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.329
 President Ahmadinejad Israel too 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.739
 destroy and debate in 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.930
 Germany runs about whether 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.030
 Ahmadinejad became the transit 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.099
 said interactively and because so said 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.989
 we will destroy israel or 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.090
 is a must be destroyed that is 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.180
 the whole debate is a massive threat 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.970
 a country and its people dissolves 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.950
 here grammatical debates from and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.459
 At the same time, the dead person is permanently becoming 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.920
 thought 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.819
 I just think that makes me indecent 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.160
 she is completely meaningless 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.019
 meanwhile , look at what each one is 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.540
 year to a 27 new Bundestag 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.819
 Happens the Bundestag is going slowly 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.950
 old jews from last marcel rich 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.380
 ranicki spoken and if of these 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 Survivors will not become worth more then 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.680
 to keep the message 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.900
 So also outsource the German 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.880
 history on the jews is also one 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.560
 more tactics you say in your book 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.569
 formulate it so we want the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.970
 Dispose of historic garbage 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.900
 by basically accusing Israel of her 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.069
 do not be much better 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.239
 but now, of course, many will 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.769
 politicians and some already have it 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.780
 gregor gysi, for example, did them 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.340
 reply and say, hear my brother 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.419
 If I am the Israeli government 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.709
 I do not criticize then 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.599
 equal to an antisemit no at all 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.910
 not that the question is not 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.200
 also not about israel criticism or if it 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.120
 in order to israel criticism applies then in 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.250
 connection with the question we have 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.780
 A China criticism of a Belgium 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.760
 criticism now we have god thank 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.379
 a ukraine review 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.000
 but we have known something in for a long time 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.069
 ukraine release the debate is seated 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.959
 flared they go on google and 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.989
 make a try and google it 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.120
 times palestine israel committees thousands 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.579
 then go google and google 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.109
 you will see tibet commitees tibet from 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.549
 China occupied for over 50 years 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.100
 hardly anything held 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.780
 there is this fixation of this obsessive 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.740
 fixation on israel and that has 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.900
 of course with German history 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.780
 to do but brother a few weeks ago 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.160
 At the end of march I have mubarak with the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.919
 defense minister of israel 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.960
 can speak and ask what can you do 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.510
 against anti-Semitism we do and we look 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.190
 very briefly to what he has answered 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.260
 what should the rulers do with it 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.900
 just no new anti-Semitism comes 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.270
 just to learn to look into the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.580
 Looking back past and the goods 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.229
 honest doctrine draw that the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.750
 Humanity shared by us all 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.370
 So that's what happened then 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.320
 not repeated and we the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.440
 make the future a little better 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440
 can 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.860
 barak so now a bit 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.780
 lord of war and peace can be 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.550
 the israel responds the finds its idea 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.660
 certainly not so good that we do not 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.370
 to come back 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.169
 that is a problem if not minister 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.760
 I would give the same answer 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.990
 he probably also gives the answer 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.430
 when it comes to the economic 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.919
 assess the situation 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.270
 No, what an Israeli minister says 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.770
 interested not see me with it 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.080
 also not what German ministers say 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 because ministers say that what minister 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.650
 always say what travel have said in 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.270
 israel them interested then he 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.530
 a very exciting, yes, look what 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.440
 briefly just what she said before 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.080
 The Israeli security knights are for 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.960
 me as german chancellor 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.270
 never negotiable 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.220
 and if that is the case then that in 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.039
 the hour of probation no empty 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.940
 words stay 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.680
 There are blank checks for a government 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.479
 but do not be I am very curious 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.220
 I hope the seriousness in the pulpits 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.600
 on which the chancellor has addressed 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.250
 I hope the serious will never 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.199
 because then they really can 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.110
 These customers and the minutes count 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.419
 until that promise is broken 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.389
 In 1973, when Israel was attacked 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.620
 depor war really was it was the 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.750
 whole by a thread 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.090
 at that time, willy has been brandishing the 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.830
 replenishment of american military goods 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.900
 to israel via german ports and 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.550
 says that was the whole German 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.039
 solidarity with Israel has also 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.410
 willy brand ac states that there are none 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.639
 neutrality of the heart would therefore have behind 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.770
 willy probably likes to fire 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.990
 discover and sacrifice milk powder 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.550
 delivered and I mean I think so 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.889
 very sure that the pulpits are serious 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.000
 thinks only after how the discussion in 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.310
 germany is that one with it 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.139
 actually wants nothing to do with that 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.180
 one from a historical responsibility 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.400
 speaks freely when you complain the dead 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.599
 she will promise this behavior 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 could not hold it was one 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.060
 rhetorical formula well meant though 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.889
 no more 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.930
 Let's hope it's not for this 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.300
 seriously comes henrik m brother forget 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.979
 Auschwitz a really more argumentative 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.380
 she read the script too 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.639
 entertaining also funny but also very 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.880
 Thank you so much for being here today 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.880
 are
