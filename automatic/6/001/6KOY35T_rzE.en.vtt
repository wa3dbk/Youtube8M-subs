00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
latest so let's take a look at the fiery

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
latest so let's take a look at the fiery
it's<00:02:09.629> almost<00:02:09.989> three<00:02:10.410> times<00:02:10.679> more<00:02:10.860> than<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
it's almost three times more than the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.860 
it's almost three times more than the
full<00:02:12.000> winters<00:02:12.510> lie

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
full winters lie

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.070 
full winters lie
you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.409> shoot<00:02:13.709> shoot<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> shoot<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:15.420> if

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you can shoot shoot and shoot again if

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.899 
you can shoot shoot and shoot again if
you<00:02:16.500> using<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> full<00:02:17.099> winters<00:02:17.459> light<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
you using the full winters light you

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.240 
you using the full winters light you
could<00:02:18.090> only<00:02:18.360> shoot<00:02:18.690> twice<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.739> party

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
could only shoot twice to the party

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.100 
could only shoot twice to the party
crashers<00:02:20.700> three<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
crashers three now I think this is a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.899 
crashers three now I think this is a
major<00:02:22.409> factor<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.190> full<00:02:23.400> winters<00:02:23.730> late

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
major factor with the full winters late

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.140 
major factor with the full winters late
yes<00:02:24.239> arguably<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.260> winters<00:02:25.560> lie<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
yes arguably for winters lie is a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
yes arguably for winters lie is a
damaging<00:02:27.150> shotgun<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.080> rekt<00:02:28.440> by<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> lot

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
damaging shotgun and I get rekt by a lot

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
damaging shotgun and I get rekt by a lot
in<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> crucible<00:02:29.610> however<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:30.989> that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
in the crucible however I think that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.530 
in the crucible however I think that
having<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.769> extra<00:02:31.920> fire<00:02:32.519> rate<00:02:32.849> could<00:02:33.329> mean

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
having this extra fire rate could mean

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.780 
having this extra fire rate could mean
that<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.750> somebody<00:02:34.260> doesn't<00:02:34.620> kill<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.280> with

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that if somebody doesn't kill you with

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.130 
that if somebody doesn't kill you with
the<00:02:35.940> phone<00:02:36.150> winters<00:02:36.450> light<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> first

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the phone winters light in the first

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.410 
the phone winters light in the first
shot<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.040> are<00:02:38.340> gonna<00:02:38.519> ruin<00:02:38.849> them<00:02:39.150> with

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
shot that you are gonna ruin them with

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.039 
shot that you are gonna ruin them with
your<00:02:39.540> second<00:02:40.049> shot<00:02:41.299> let's<00:02:42.299> talk<00:02:42.569> about<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
your second shot let's talk about the

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.619 
your second shot let's talk about the
impact<00:02:43.560> yes<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.190> impact<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.150> party

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
impact yes the impact on the party

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.089 
impact yes the impact on the party
crasher<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.170> slightly<00:02:46.440> less<00:02:46.709> than<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.010> full

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
crasher is slightly less than the full

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.910 
crasher is slightly less than the full
winters<00:02:47.670> however<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.750> first<00:02:49.049> upgrade<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.739> my

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
winters however the first upgrade on my

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.030 
winters however the first upgrade on my
role<00:02:50.160> makes<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.000> same<00:02:51.299> impact<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.040> boost

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
role makes it the same impact and boost

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.099 
role makes it the same impact and boost
the<00:02:53.220> range<00:02:53.519> past<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> Phil<00:02:54.390> winters<00:02:54.840> lies

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
the range past the Phil winters lies

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.550 
the range past the Phil winters lies
range<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:56.250> let's<00:02:56.459> talk<00:02:56.700> about<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.299> stability

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
range now let's talk about the stability

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.770 
range now let's talk about the stability
now<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.700> third<00:02:59.970> more<00:03:00.269> than<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> Phil

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
now it's a third more than the Phil

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.990 
now it's a third more than the Phil
winters<00:03:01.140> lie<00:03:01.379> full<00:03:01.980> winters<00:03:02.310> light<00:03:02.489> has<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> lot

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
winters lie full winters light has a lot

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.930 
winters lie full winters light has a lot
of<00:03:03.030> kick<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.629> party<00:03:04.260> crasher<00:03:04.530> has<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.340> lot<00:03:05.609> less

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
of kick and party crasher has a lot less

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330 
of kick and party crasher has a lot less
so<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.450> fiery<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.109> stability<00:03:07.799> this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so if the fiery and stability this

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
so if the fiery and stability this
shotgun<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:09.120> truly<00:03:09.690> dead<00:03:09.870> leap<00:03:10.109> minute<00:03:10.440> you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
shotgun is truly dead leap minute you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.490 
shotgun is truly dead leap minute you
can<00:03:10.769> shoot<00:03:11.069> shoot<00:03:11.730> shoot<00:03:11.909> again<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.870> each

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
can shoot shoot shoot again and each

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.390 
can shoot shoot shoot again and each
three<00:03:13.829> times<00:03:14.129> you'll<00:03:14.609> be<00:03:14.790> accurate<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:17.190> let<00:03:17.370> me

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
three times you'll be accurate so let me

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.099 
three times you'll be accurate so let me
know<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.849> comment<00:03:18.269> section<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:18.750> you

know in the comment section what you
think<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.769> shotgun<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:20.519> far<00:03:20.910> I'd<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
think of this shotgun so far I'd be

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.330 
think of this shotgun so far I'd be
happy<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.780> discuss<00:03:22.260> with<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.470> guys<00:03:22.769> what<00:03:23.220> you

happy to discuss with you guys what you
think<00:03:23.609> if<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.910> better<00:03:24.120> than<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.450> Feldman's

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
think if it's better than the Feldman's
