around<00:00:09.929> 38<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.740> farm<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:12.150> pretty

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
around 38 on farm and it's going pretty

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.360 
around 38 on farm and it's going pretty
good<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.290> pretty<00:00:13.380> good<00:00:13.679> game<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.070> only<00:00:14.219> have

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
good it's pretty good game I only have

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.849 
good it's pretty good game I only have
one<00:00:14.670> down<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.410> probably<00:00:16.590> get

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
one down so you know I can probably get

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
one down so you know I can probably get
to<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> pretty<00:00:17.220> high<00:00:17.310> round<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:17.820> aiming<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.180> 50

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to a pretty high round I'm aiming for 50

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.529 
to a pretty high round I'm aiming for 50
or<00:00:19.289> somewhere<00:00:19.710> around<00:00:19.800> there<00:00:20.330> no<00:00:21.330> it's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
or somewhere around there no it's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.689 
or somewhere around there no it's
possible<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.289> only<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.619> down<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
possible because I only have one down so

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
possible because I only have one down so
I<00:00:23.730> mean<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> pretty<00:00:24.570> good<00:00:24.750> game<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.560> what

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
I mean it's a pretty good game so what

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.019 
I mean it's a pretty good game so what
you're<00:00:25.980> seeing<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> last<00:00:26.760> group<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
you're seeing here is the last group of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
you're seeing here is the last group of
zombies<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.170> trying<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> finish

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
zombies and I'm just trying to finish

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
zombies and I'm just trying to finish
them<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.279> mp5<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.179> leave<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
them off with the mp5 and leave a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
them off with the mp5 and leave a
crawler<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:31.410> something<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.340> hit<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
crawler or something and then hit the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.590 
crawler or something and then hit the
box<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> regen<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.570> we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
box for the regen so can we do it can we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
box for the regen so can we do it can we
just<00:00:36.690> kill<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.469> zombies<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.610> know

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
just kill all these zombies you know

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.930 
just kill all these zombies you know
probably<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.620> group<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.760> got<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
probably this one group and I got a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.260 
probably this one group and I got a
double<00:00:42.090> time

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
double time

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.260 
double time
so<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:44.200> should<00:00:44.440> be<00:00:44.560> pretty<00:00:44.710> easy<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:45.160> mean<00:00:45.430> this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
so it should be pretty easy I mean this

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.270 
so it should be pretty easy I mean this
fail<00:00:46.630> was<00:00:46.990> actually<00:00:47.410> pretty<00:00:47.650> funny<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.010> thought

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
fail was actually pretty funny I thought

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.950 
fail was actually pretty funny I thought
it<00:00:48.430> was<00:00:48.520> funny<00:00:48.760> though<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.240> was<00:00:49.330> hilarious<00:00:49.840> I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
it was funny though it was hilarious I

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.810 
it was funny though it was hilarious I
was<00:00:50.050> laughing<00:00:50.530> no<00:00:51.010> normal<00:00:51.340> person<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
was laughing no normal person and

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.030 
was laughing no normal person and
probably<00:00:52.000> rage<00:00:52.360> but<00:00:53.080> I<00:00:53.200> thought<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.770> was<00:00:53.860> hell

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
probably rage but I thought it was hell

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.250 
probably rage but I thought it was hell
here<00:00:54.250> he<00:00:54.400> is<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.730> then<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.540> got<00:00:55.690> my<00:00:55.810> shotguns

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
here he is and then I got my shotguns

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.110 
here he is and then I got my shotguns
after<00:00:56.590> this<00:00:56.710> game<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.100> I<00:00:57.130> may<00:00:57.280> be<00:00:57.400> happier

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120
