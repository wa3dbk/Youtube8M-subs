00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
room together and my baby has decided

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
room together and my baby has decided
that<00:00:59.129> she<00:00:59.370> likes<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> sing<00:00:59.969> along<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that she likes to sing along when I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.759 
that she likes to sing along when I
practice<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> particularly<00:01:03.769> there's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
practice and so particularly there's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950 
practice and so particularly there's
this<00:01:05.100> part<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> Britten<00:01:06.240> concerto<00:01:06.780> which

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this part in the Britten concerto which

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
this part in the Britten concerto which
I<00:01:07.229> played<00:01:07.680> last<00:01:07.860> night<00:01:08.040> recording<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.000> next

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I played last night recording this next

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.300 
I played last night recording this next
week

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
week

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
week
very<00:01:11.310> tricky<00:01:11.549> passage<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.299> double

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
very tricky passage with these double

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.340 
very tricky passage with these double
harmonics

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
harmonics

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
harmonics
she<00:01:13.920> loves<00:01:14.130> harmonics<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.119> play<00:01:15.299> harmonic

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
she loves harmonics so I play harmonic

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.530 
she loves harmonics so I play harmonic
so<00:01:15.900> she<00:01:15.960> says<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> can't<00:01:18.390> tell

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so she says that and then I can't tell

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149 
so she says that and then I can't tell
if<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:18.780> playing<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.110> harmonics<00:01:19.590> correct

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
if I'm playing my harmonics correct

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.679 
if I'm playing my harmonics correct
later<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> tune<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:20.909> anything<00:01:21.090> else<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.540> could

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
later in tune or anything else I could

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
later in tune or anything else I could
only<00:01:21.810> hear<00:01:22.020> her<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> morning<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
only hear her so this morning was a it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
only hear her so this morning was a it
was<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> great<00:01:25.310> opportunity<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.640> be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
was a great opportunity to actually be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
was a great opportunity to actually be
at<00:01:27.210> privacy<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> silence<00:01:28.549> for<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> little

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
at privacy and silence for a little

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
at privacy and silence for a little
while<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.720> generally<00:01:30.869> speaking<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.650> think

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
while but but generally speaking I think

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
while but but generally speaking I think
for<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.240> defines<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.810> good

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
for me what really defines a good

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.490 
for me what really defines a good
practice<00:01:34.439> session<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.100> where<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.880> feel

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
practice session is one where I can feel

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.149 
practice session is one where I can feel
entirely<00:01:37.500> focused<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.799> trying<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
entirely focused what I'm trying to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.560 
entirely focused what I'm trying to
accomplish<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.700> always<00:01:41.820> helps<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.329> me<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
accomplish it always helps for me to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.950 
accomplish it always helps for me to
have<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.960> sort<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.320> goal<00:01:44.540> at<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> point

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
have some sort of a goal at this point

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.929 
have some sort of a goal at this point
in<00:01:46.079> my<00:01:46.110> career<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.890> easier<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> find<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
in my career it's easier to find the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.800 
in my career it's easier to find the
goals<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.720> there's<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:51.180> specter

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
goals because there's that that specter

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
goals because there's that that specter
of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.049> upcoming<00:01:52.320> performance<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> recording

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
of the upcoming performance of recording

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.580 
of the upcoming performance of recording
or<00:01:54.030> whatever<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> may<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:57.259> staring<00:01:58.259> at

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
or whatever it may be that is staring at

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.550 
or whatever it may be that is staring at
me<00:01:58.829> saying<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:02:00.210> ready<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.049> has<00:02:01.350> to
