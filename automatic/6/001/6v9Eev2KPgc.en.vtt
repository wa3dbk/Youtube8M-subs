so<00:00:09.450> let's<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.719> started<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.200> we're<00:00:10.980> gonna

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so let's get started so we're gonna

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.520 
so let's get started so we're gonna
start<00:00:11.429> with<00:00:11.790> our<00:00:11.820> simulated<00:00:12.780> bushmeat<00:00:13.170> today

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
start with our simulated bushmeat today

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.880 
start with our simulated bushmeat today
and<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.730> three<00:00:15.000> samples<00:00:15.590> something<00:00:16.590> big

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and we have three samples something big

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.560 
and we have three samples something big
is<00:00:17.250> happening<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:17.940> eleventh<00:00:18.359> grade

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
is happening in this eleventh grade

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.349 
is happening in this eleventh grade
biology<00:00:18.779> class<00:00:19.410> we're<00:00:20.369> trying<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> actually

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
biology class we're trying to actually

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
biology class we're trying to actually
kind<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.539> change<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> world<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.519> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
kind of change the world a little bit we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
kind of change the world a little bit we
thought<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.939> lesson<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.359> would

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
thought up a lesson that would

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.410 
thought up a lesson that would
incorporate<00:00:24.810> aspects<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> molecular<00:00:26.189> biology

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
incorporate aspects of molecular biology

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.890 
incorporate aspects of molecular biology

biochemistry<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.470> created<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
biochemistry and so we created a way to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
biochemistry and so we created a way to
to<00:00:32.700> teach<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.059> those<00:00:33.239> things<00:00:33.450> together<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to teach all those things together you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.680 
to teach all those things together you
want<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> check<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.399> describe<00:00:35.880> write<00:00:36.510> down

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
want to check it out describe write down

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
want to check it out describe write down
some<00:00:36.899> observations<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.829> smells<00:00:38.129> like

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
some observations what it smells like

photos that I got last week from one of
our<00:01:00.629> collaborators<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.500> Nairobi<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> an

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
our collaborators in Nairobi this is an

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
our collaborators in Nairobi this is an
eland<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.019> interesting<00:01:04.229> because

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
eland I think it's interesting because

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.830 
eland I think it's interesting because
it's<00:01:05.129> relative<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> something<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.630> going

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it's relative to something that's going

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
it's relative to something that's going
on<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.049> real<00:01:07.350> life<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.130> only<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on in real life and not only that but

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.200 
on in real life and not only that but
it's<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.330> crisis<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.290> an<00:01:10.439> issue<00:01:10.680> I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
it's like a crisis it's like an issue I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's like a crisis it's like an issue I
really<00:01:12.210> believe<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> original<00:01:12.780> research<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
really believe in original research to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
really believe in original research to
discover<00:01:14.220> something<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> students<00:01:15.659> know

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
discover something and the students know

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.749 
discover something and the students know
what<00:01:15.900> they're<00:01:16.049> doing<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.439> an<00:01:16.560> application

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
what they're doing has an application

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.859 
what they're doing has an application
it's<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.330> through<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> teachers

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's not just going through the teachers

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's not just going through the teachers

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
always hear about this kind of science

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
always hear about this kind of science
being<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> place<00:01:25.950> used<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> real<00:01:27.000> world<00:01:27.180> to
