00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so you can see now the timers popped up

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
so you can see now the timers popped up
and<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.909> 30<00:01:24.240> minutes<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and you have 30 minutes to make it to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
and you have 30 minutes to make it to
the<00:01:25.560> extraction<00:01:25.890> point<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> once<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the extraction point so once you get to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
the extraction point so once you get to
the<00:01:28.170> extraction<00:01:28.500> point<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> timer

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the extraction point you the timer

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
the extraction point you the timer
resets<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> 10<00:01:30.960> minutes<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
resets to 10 minutes and you have to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
resets to 10 minutes and you have to
hold<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.520> point<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.180> 10<00:01:33.360> minutes<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.869> make

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hold that point for 10 minutes to make

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
hold that point for 10 minutes to make
sure<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> helicopter<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.250> safely<00:01:35.610> take

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
sure that the helicopter can safely take

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
sure that the helicopter can safely take
off<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> pressure<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> always<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> always

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
off so the pressure is always on always

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.560 
off so the pressure is always on always
that's<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:38.970> thing<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.360> about

that's what this thing is all about

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
that's what this thing is all about
pressure<00:01:41.240> all<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.290> gonna<00:01:43.409> grab

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pressure all right so we're gonna grab

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
pressure all right so we're gonna grab

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.100 

Herk<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.810> wanna<00:02:07.930> do<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> honors<00:02:10.110> jumping

to<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.360> farcry<00:02:13.690> he's<00:02:13.870> incredibly<00:02:14.380> graceful

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to do in farcry he's incredibly graceful

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.770

and I appreciate that so now we're

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.229 
and I appreciate that so now we're
swooping<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.620> mission<00:02:18.099> where<00:02:18.370> pagan<00:02:19.090> min

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
swooping into a mission where pagan min

the thing I think with the perma death
be<00:03:06.489> coming<00:03:06.760> back<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.569> learning
