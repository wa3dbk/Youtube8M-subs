00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
programmable you can program them

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.179 
programmable you can program them
yourself<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.930> rake<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.500> the

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
the nice thing about these pedals is

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.620 
the nice thing about these pedals is
there's<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.250> once<00:05:27.850> I<00:05:27.940> can<00:05:28.060> just<00:05:28.150> go<00:05:28.270> find<00:05:28.450> it

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
there's a once I can just go find it

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:36.440 
there's a once I can just go find it
they're<00:05:29.170> able<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:29.560> move<00:05:29.740> in<00:05:30.310> and<00:05:30.970> out<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:33.870> also

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
they're able to move in and out and also

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.290 
they're able to move in and out and also
these<00:05:37.450> right<00:05:37.870> here<00:05:38.340> if<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.400> loosen<00:05:40.060> those<00:05:40.240> up

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
these right here if you loosen those up

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.140 
these right here if you loosen those up
you<00:05:41.260> can<00:05:41.440> actually<00:05:41.950> move<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.250> chain<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:43.120> can

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
you can actually move the chain you can

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.240 
you can actually move the chain you can
move<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.600> puddle<00:05:43.960> down<00:05:44.170> like<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.830> the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
move the puddle down like that and the

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.820 
move the puddle down like that and the
channel<00:05:45.610> move<00:05:45.760> out<00:05:46.230> but<00:05:47.230> right<00:05:47.410> now<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.800> a

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
channel move out but right now I have a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.230 
channel move out but right now I have a
train<00:05:48.040> set<00:05:48.430> rate<00:05:48.670> in<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.820> middle<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.180> the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
train set rate in the middle and the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.210 
train set rate in the middle and the
reason<00:05:49.510> being<00:05:49.540> is<00:05:49.810> because<00:05:49.840> if<00:05:50.380> i<00:05:50.650> put<00:05:51.010> if<00:05:51.130> i

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
reason being is because if i put if i

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.290 
reason being is because if i put if i
put<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.490> all<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.670> way<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:51.940> end<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.120> chain

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
put it all the way to the end the chain

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.240 
put it all the way to the end the chain
is<00:05:52.360> going<00:05:52.480> to<00:05:52.570> be<00:05:52.630> way<00:05:52.870> out<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:53.170> here<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.950> i<00:05:54.070> put

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
is going to be way out to here and i put

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.650 
is going to be way out to here and i put
them<00:05:54.370> all<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.610> way<00:05:54.730> in<00:05:54.910> here<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.360> chain<00:05:55.540> is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
them all the way in here the chain is

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.900
