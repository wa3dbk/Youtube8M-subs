00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 amy sherman the hello nurse 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.490
 welcome to the farm welcome to coco 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 tv today i present you a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 mouse that comes to us two cougar 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.789
 after the 200th here come today 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 the 700th of this sum will you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 imagine it pretty visible is quite 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.360
 audible if only in relation to the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 serial number 700 donations rather high 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.129
 range and for once you'll see 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.059
 we have a very pleasant mouse especially 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.980
 at the level of the quality of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.280
 manufacturing because it is endowed 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 including an aluminum skeleton 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 actually that already been seen elsewhere 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.059
 but she really has two small dots 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.710
 quite nice who are pretty 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 attractive on paper and under the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 hand too so I quickly move on 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.690
 the packaging you will see it a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.940
 pretty funny box actually first 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.350
 time we see a box like that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 proves the mouse present underneath 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 on the sides we have the information 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 classics so you imagine it 700 m from 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 high-end that also means is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 first and foremost it will have just about everything 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.490
 what it takes to shine at the top of the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 basket with features 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.799
 relatively luxurious techniques for the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.810
 blow at the level of the bundle is enough 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.369
 medium for a high end since we have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 a user's guide 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.540
 a small series of stickers the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.040
 cover that contained all that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 Besides, it allows me to visualize 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 that the mouse won the product this 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 design award in 2014 and for the first time 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.560
 it is true that it is rather look and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 default to please this with each sentence will be 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.439
 judge sorry we also have the peas 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.090
 then by cons see the little worry 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.409
 bundle side it is there you have times 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.390
 it's nothing but nothing for them 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.500
 tidy up it's a shame we have a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.689
 removable part that will replace 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 this one so two smaller sizes 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.799
 years is visible here you see 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.409
 largely so this one is said 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.790
 standard this one covered with soft 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.239
 touch of a beautiful finish with a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.039
 cougar in part i would say illustrated with 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.810
 the system of hanging underneath so 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.520
 smaller part 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.860
 will therefore replace the standard that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.870
 she is simply plastic 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 that list of good quality then 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 precisely speaking of the plastic crisis 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940
 so we can talk about finishing 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.660
 dassouri well it's simple it's perfect 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.819
 nothing to say 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.150
 it's really a very good mouse 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.920
 finished pretty enough so pretty enough in 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.030
 manufacturing quality a game like 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.580
 I say it every time 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.380
 everyone will judge against the look of 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 the mouse is working is enough 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.250
 angular but as far as I can you 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.930
 tell it right away at the take 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.180
 in hand it's quite comfortable so we 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.980
 find that back part said 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.920
 standard with a little button that will 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.950
 allow by lowering it here are two the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.410
 remove and go back to the clicks 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.430
 and that is fixed is very simple 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.569
 found the metal skeleton in aluminum 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.370
 other metal 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.610
 here the drawer that will manage the setting 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.080
 up to weight with a small background 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.810
 metal bar so it's really 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.049
 rather well finished and materials that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.630
 breathes solidity at the click 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.730
 we have a good quality plastic on 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.049
 country button a wheel I read everything 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.359
 immediately excellent I found them 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.340
 really exceptional she is very 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.350
 friendly his only fault to the limit 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.329
 may be a bit too golden but that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.040
 it's still not very bad it's 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.109
 we finally expect when we 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.790
 look at having an aluminum wheel and what 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.829
 is not the case it's plastic by 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.410
 against really scrolling is nickel 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.269
 chrome the screen are very marked I love 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.430
 this type of small wheel 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.859
 finally we finish on the front with 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.730
 the two ergo find from the end of 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.280
 metal skeleton 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.010
 we will start here on the pavement 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 right side of the plastic gum holes 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.780
 for grasping then with a channel 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.730
 uncertain some forms of art they say 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.440
 on the other side we find a 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.109
 platform still in pastilles gums 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.299
 holed up with the button sniper a button 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.569
 two side buttons forgive forgive me 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.170
 and a button next to the click relatively 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.930
 welcome this part before a small 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.880
 quiz there was gun is gold metal 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.030
 it's really what strengthens 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.930
 the aesthetic identity of the mouse in 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.479
 below we will find 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.120
 the metal skeleton in aluminum I 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.440
 said we also have a little button a 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.810
 little button a life this pardon excuse 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.039
 me who will allow you will not see 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.669
 necessarily on the screen because that's 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.330
 pretty sensitive i'll unscrewed davis is 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.030
 divided 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.009
 that's going to go back up the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.250
 part you see almost flat and if I 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:49.210
 screw in the other direction 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.889
 she will redo as she goes down and 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.380
 so presented a little inclination 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.060
 stronger that will us works 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.940
 obviously with the other party no 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.229
 worry we have four legs to a sensor at 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.020
 center 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.169
 the usb is gold plated the cable is sheathed 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.530
 it's normal on the inside front 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.580
 on the diode dit hergÃ© but then there if 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.199
 I'm not going to go into the mode 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.449
 breathing you see she goes off herself 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.699
 reignite so who says ten finish 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.110
 shimmering possibilities of colors by 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.110
 against modes are not extremely 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.120
 provided since we have globally a mode 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.550
 classic illuminated a breathing mode and 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.840
 that's pretty much all for more 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.130
 safety I will invite you to come and read the 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.020
 written test but I'm pretty sure of 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.880
 what I'm saying here is small 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.630
 information diodes on the level of 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.820
 retained dpi in four levels adjustable 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.610
 in steps of 50 if my memory is good 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.710
 so a mouse was really making you 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.210
 look level quite particular she 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.830
 will not please in any event in 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.120
 terms of handling given 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.460
 that it is relatively datable you 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.949
 would like to have duider duking and 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.659
 from the flu palm and slides very very well 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.740
 the cliques are rhone souls since 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.479
 we will attack the party 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.400
 technique so a good two mouse 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.659
 qualities I'm going to take the box for 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.210
 represent you 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.340
 and you talk about other points 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.159
 techniques the sensor is a waves at 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.250
 9800 so the high-end a8 1200dpi 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:12.009
 so it can be changed without tools 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.320
 on the back we have a part 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.909
 removable 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.580
 what a high tone we have a 32 processor 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.870
 bits onboard cortex arm to handle all 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.699
 the mackerel stories that can 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.979
 be hosted on the memory chip of 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.590
 512 kg who is injured inside of 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.360
 the obviously Polish mouse at 1000 rr 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.280
 tss and I think I went around 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.500
 the buttons are programmable she 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.120
 promises 30 g of acceleration on the 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.680
 sensor but that's the wave or 9800 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.210
 normally 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.250
 must know him by heart if you 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.680
 we've been following on the farm since a 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.320
 time she weighs 130 grams which is 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.759
 maybe the little negative point of the 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.680
 mouse she is pretty gogh but that 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.169
 it was predictable with a heart in 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.289
 metal for the rest at the tariff level 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.020
 we are on a product that hits the 120 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.419
 euros 129 of head if my memory is 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.100
 good it's quite expensive but not more than 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.720
 the big average of the top mice 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.360
 range of the type rate 9 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.009
 erat set to not quote them so we have 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.620
 something nice really good 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.870
 finished at the level of the look ben here it is 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.910
 to score but the grip is enough 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.550
 pleasant it slides well there is no 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.440
 sensor side concern so really 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.910
 something very pleasant and for 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.770
 the shot I tend to say that cougar 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.310
 do not miss his entry on the high side 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.500
 of range 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.240
 the only little lack in fact that's it 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.530
 weights that do not have small boxes 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.520
 storage is a bit of a shame 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.789
 do not eat bread and it would have been 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.729
 welcome so it was the 700th 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:34.470
 on cowcotland 's sure your tv 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.729
 I invite you as usual to come 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.289
 read the written test if you want more 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:38.580
 information as usual I you 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:42.260
 wish a very good day and 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.260
 I say goodbye and see you soon
