 lines whether a storm is coming 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.190
 storms I shelter in this tree together

 shelter in this tree along with my 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.630
 awake thoughts dreaming of a 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.090
 past different if the goals are

 victories I want to dedicate myself to lose you and 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.800

 heard but trillo and the madness that I 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.480
 accompanies has become rite to write is 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.299
 a martyrdom science blood ink die 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 it's about the papyrus with a couple of letters 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.960
 I will reach the precipice in sleeping this 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 space you give me crucified the black 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.759
 the sky asking for help and I receive

 repeat what happened and I feel in my 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.740
 damage alone lonely as the sun continues 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.530
 shining that night comes the future 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.900
 it is a reproach touches but it does not exist 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.090
 storyteller the sad poet and the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.760
 smile towards the language that the scar 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.100
 it's true and the nightmare does not end and 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.560
 denominates miseries lost among my 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.600
 lines whether a storm is coming 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.119
 storms I shelter in this tree together 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
 with my thoughts awake and the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.830
 Nightmare does not end and in my options 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.930
 wounds lost between my lines if you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.729
 looming a storm of storms 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 shelter in this tree along with my 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.960
 thoughts I sleep thinking about the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 fears that haunt me between rounds of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.950
 bitterness caused by my shadow my 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.750
 marble heart only writes 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.820
 hidden with a hundred zeal with paper 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.190
 knives and some wounds my tree 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 genealogical only throws me leaves while 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.420
 the ink asks why they do not stop 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.100
 hours of love that I keep 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.350
 between my things are so big that they 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.819
 find in Pandora's box feels 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.890
 my discomfort is usually always 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.810
 dissatisfied and the man who gives me more water 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.850
 and I keep doing it huge look at this 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 gentleman with the decomposed suit has 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.660
 willing to cut their wings to not 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.790

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.440
 put in a 50 heart to which he 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.270
 they lacked pretexts I take care of my language and of 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.490
 I have no doubt that I have betrayed 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.020

 storm of torments I take refuge in this 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.930
 tree together with my thoughts 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.880

 the storm is always clarity though 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.150
