00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 sword like my daughter's or a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.599
 of the most powerful in the world but well 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.349
 I'll explain a little about 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.360
 swords information about them and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.790
 swords you've had before and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.899
 those that you currently have and those that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.430
 can have a future well let's start that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 we know it has 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.990
 cuado and simonyi not the sword that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.050
 gave the father d 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.750
 wina is not of cuina that more always 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.450
 with him is the most important memory 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.060
 treasure and this sword is the one that carries 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.600
 during the whole series with him is not a 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.399
 sword very important to him 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.239
 with which he has defeated all his 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 enemies after we have the blood and 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.020
 tetsu 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.000
 is the demonic sword that buys and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560
 purchase 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.780
 gives you the logo 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.909
 that is, he had a curse but 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.270
 single 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.549
 when listening to this 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.119
 it stays is not a sword of the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.119
 top 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.300
 50 guadaiza river bonus is one of the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.760
 most valued accounts 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.190
 then there is the great Chinese sun 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.030
 I do not know if it's pronounced like that but he wants 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.890
 say clear authorial water is one of the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.409
 swords that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.229
 also of the most important and expensive 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.619
 from all over the world the one piece and it's the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 sword that gives you human river when what 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.119
 defeat extract the ship 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 good is a sword also that is gold 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.079
 which is gold is not anything wrong since 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.430
 with this you can make stronger attacks 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.270
 as it says it is heavier and is not 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.870
 nothing bad this 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.480
 but these are the ones that had now 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.700
 in after these two years but 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.710
 previously I had also the help to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.880
 siri that broke 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.040
 was the one that also got in lockdown 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.250
 but 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.520
 the boy this that oxidizes everything 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.950
 has a fruit oxidize in myslowice 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.980
 It breaks or does not rust to help 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.350
 Cyril and that's why he got his dream 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.550
 which is the sword that gave him river 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.640
 human after I had 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.510
 A curious fact is that at the beginning 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.910
 72 swords that was the one that my 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.490
 son destroyed him but you do not know how 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.650
 they call it is only known that he had the watered down 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.370
 and rudder yes and two more swords but I do not know 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.080
 You not know his name 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.519
 and this is all after he has had in 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.140
 some sagas like that has had swords that 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.620
 normal ones like the ones I had here 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.080
 example that sword 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.500
 normal and current but neither has 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.180
 said the name not so this is all 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.180
 a little information and I wanted them 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.580
 ask what they believe about in the future 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.140
 about what swords will have more going to 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.159
 continue with these three swords during 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.710
 each series or going to get another one 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.900
 sword stronger and better not 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.070
 for example the one that my daughter has cradle of 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.470
 this species I do not know how to comment and we 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.470
 we see in the next video bye bye
