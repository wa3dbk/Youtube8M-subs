00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.890
 in antiquity what the primitives 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.050
 they called the great flood could have been 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.450
 actually to causes or alien entities 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.939
 to our planet one of these events 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.970
 it was the destruction of the planet diamat 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 better known to the Greeks as fight 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.070
 on likewise this planetoid also 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.230
 appears in certain legends under the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.930
 name of lucifer or moon although in the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.960
 presently it is known as the belt of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 asteroids 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.789
 nevertheless and since the 1960s the 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.530
 douglas company affirm that said 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.929
 planet was destroyed because of a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.019
 much cosmic collision has been investigated 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.120
 in fact in fact many experts 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.710
 state that after such catastrophe 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.719
 they produced a series of phenomena that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.030
 a lot has to do with the destruction 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.530
 of the atlantis and memory 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.869
 we talk about certain incidents where 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.470
 supposedly some of the sky fell from the sky 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.470
 ice blocks 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 but in what way has the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 catastrophe of the planet phaeton how is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570
 possible that at this moment 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 find in the asteroid belt 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 and ultimately what is the relationship that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.280
 has with the land and the age of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280
 atlantis 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 well tonight with this time of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 radio with all our listening friends 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 fireflies and professionals in question 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.070
 let's reveal each one of these 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.869
 unknowns of the hand of colin rivas 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.580
 linguist and archaeologist in connection 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.580
 direct with the city of london 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.420
 rivas pollock very good good night 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.420
 nights 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.300
 Goodnight 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.250
 we hear you perfectly another what 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.370
 I listen almost like I'm in 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.229
 australia escaped the economic crack well 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.380
 Yes, but maybe that's what we 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.670
 they are trimming the phone with 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.080
 the economic crises and that is 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.330
 already affecting average europe good 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
 let's talk about other things that are also 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.410
 more than interesting today for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.060
 get us in scoring background me 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.010
 would like you to explain us first 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.050
 place how the catastrophe of this happened 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 planet called tiamat that according to 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.840
 experts is currently in the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.840
 asteroid belt 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.730
 try try if possible what is 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.380
 because I know you and as a good friend 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.700
 what are you trying to summarize well all 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.180
 these questions that I have a lot to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.180
 Make yourself in 88 seconds please 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.360
 you will not be able to but explain what 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.090
 which is what we can come right and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.269
 easier as possible but as in these 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.549
 always astronomical subjects in the subjects 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.859
 of holiness and memory and the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.230
 existence of previous civilizations 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.560
 your average is not always this always 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.489
 they are quite controversial topics but 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.620
 like you 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.260
 well you said if we go again to the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.260
 legends and the myths of the ancestors do not 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.790
 only in the cheap dough in the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.870
 chimalpopoca in South America or we have 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.670
 popul vuh or in india also even in 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.420
 Sumerian legends of creation the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.310
 of tablets we do not see that as I said 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.040
 was this planet appears 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.100
 it is taken as a god called 'effect 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.280
 for those for the Greeks 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.040
 and I the staff I was interested in is my 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.050
 opinion of what deciphers a bit and what 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.050
 that I have contrasted with other 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.670
 colleagues does not possibly make many 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.810
 thousands of years 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.020
 at least 50 thousand years 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.730
 let's say there would be one and this is going to sound 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.210
 a little bit radical not a science 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.210
 fiction but this is what I think I do not 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.810
 it's just my opinion let's say a race 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.360
 of beings perfectly could have 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.040
 come bounce to our our 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.540
 galaxy our solar system and in that 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.720
 rebound say a galactic war 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.370
 in another in your galaxy 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.870
 called in alpha docked is a system 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.950
 alpha attacked that there are many monuments 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.130
 oriented 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.810
 in fact in asia in egypt even in 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.810
 Mesoamerica and in North America 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.840
 these beings let's say they go through this 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.350
 planet that 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.710
 this planet could be the study of 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.570
 the doubts about the belt of the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.960
 asteroids between mars and jupiter 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.419
 it was from a planet an aqueous planetoid and 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.630
 then this may also have given 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.729
 origin to the legends and myths of the 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.830
 floods so there was not just one there was 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.770
 there were several the flood if at a time 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.770
 sudden glacial because 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.290
 chord we remember that the ice age 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.870
 you find it takes a lot with food in the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.380
 stomach and other animals so this is 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.330
 happened suddenly then why 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.070
 why 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.229
 why some modern scientists 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.110
 they want the so-called glacial period or 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.280
 global warming never happened 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.130
 when this reason that you are 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.729
 pointing out that it has left racial the 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.770
 teeth 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.169
 there is for example a book that is very very 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.090
 interesting from 232 who you see jackson 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.399
 that are called the nor skin yesterday that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.990
 it calls the cataclysm and another catastrophe 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.610
 this is even explained by the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.409
 wars that I do not know if you know him and 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.279
 manuel warlike and almost nothing that is a 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:58.309
 myth I saw it catastrophist too very 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:59.689
 controversial and too much if the rival of 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:02.270
 outsider 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:05.719
 the cosmologist not from the 60's in 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.729
 go ahead but not but they say 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:10.930
 mainly that due to events 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.909
 sometimes cosmic sun 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.330
 let's say like this catastrophe that from 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.249
 this planet calls you and lucifer does not have 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.499
 to see anything with the denomination of 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.999
 demon called it's called that because it's 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.830
 the one who was carrying the light 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:28.879
 let's say it was like a second sun 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.830
 because light bounced to be a planet 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.360
 quotes then from the earth the 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.490
 natives of the earth saw it as if 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.639
 it was a second sun that's why a war 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.709
 of the galaxies it looks like there are two suns 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.360
 what are they saying let's say that a 

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:42.860
 little movies with galaxy wars 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.120
 they are counting a little the limited 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.520
 those of our ancestors 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.440
 and that is also reflected in the 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.449
 ceremony is Celtic typical of 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.729
 halloween where is how it is represented 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.710
 like a hollow pumpkin not coming back 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.620
 coming back to colin please that you 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.930
 you go now to another to another important point 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.570
 of story truths novel that is 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.010
 very good to talk about that halloween theme 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.750
 but that is not the issue that concerns us today 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.310
 I say going back to the present we have 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.350
 to mention that since the beginning of 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.570
 month of August different points of 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.340
 Africa Mexico and the United Kingdom have been 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.139
 witnesses of a strange phenomenon where 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.570
 the witnesses claim to have seen how 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.760
 They fell from the sky, huge blocks 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.919
 ice cream of several kilos 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.660
 these colin incidents will happen 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.550
 little more than a month and have reached 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.250
 destroy auto fields and 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.539
 left behind workshops and factories of what 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.610
 ice blocks class we're 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.860
 talking because some experts have 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.400
 baptized as aerolites you would be 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.009
 according to this definition or not 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.139
 obviously because they are aerial rocks what 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.370
 which means aerolites but the problem 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.279
 is that in the stratosphere there is no 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.169
 enough water enough so that 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.810
 produce for example there are blocks that 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:56.310
 they have dropped that they started 50 and up to 100 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.379
 a hundred and something who I am not not 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.020
 I'm wrong like in Brazil I do not know if 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:04.610
 has also spent Spain in England or 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.610
 obviously even in sites of
