he<00:01:38.369> he's<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.909> been<00:01:39.030> dominating<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
he he's just been dominating and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
he he's just been dominating and
honestly<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.549> he's<00:01:41.850> looking<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
honestly I think he's looking good to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
honestly I think he's looking good to
take<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.950> championship<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> expect<00:01:45.030> him<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
take this championship I expect him to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.789 
take this championship I expect him to
at<00:01:45.420> least<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.810> into<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> Final<00:01:46.409> Four<00:01:46.560> into

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
at least get into the Final Four into

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
at least get into the Final Four into
the<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.220> round<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> four<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.970> he<00:01:48.960> might<00:01:49.110> take

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the the round of four and he might take

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.240 
the the round of four and he might take
the<00:01:49.320> entire<00:01:49.590> thing<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.950> way<00:01:50.040> he's<00:01:50.159> been

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the entire thing the way he's been

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
the entire thing the way he's been
playing<00:01:50.520> lately<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.420> we'll<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:51.990> how<00:01:52.020> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
playing lately so we'll see how that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.749 
playing lately so we'll see how that
goes<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.470> long<00:01:52.619> run<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.100> he<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.490> pick<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
goes in long run really he is my pick is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
goes in long run really he is my pick is
one<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:54.720> likely<00:01:55.020> players<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> make

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
one of the more likely players to make

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
one of the more likely players to make
it<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> round<00:01:56.130> four<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.670> awesome

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it into the round four in this awesome

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
it into the round four in this awesome
group<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.229> he's<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
group it looks like he's going to be

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
group it looks like he's going to be
scouting<00:01:59.960> clockwise<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.140> he's<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
scouting clockwise and he's going to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
scouting clockwise and he's going to
come<00:02:01.530> across<00:02:01.649> called<00:02:02.130> space<00:02:02.369> first<00:02:02.610> Callen

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
come across called space first Callen

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.520 
come across called space first Callen
fortunately<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.200> scouting

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
fortunately is going to be scouting

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.830 
fortunately is going to be scouting
counterclockwise<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.210> might<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.689> my

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
counterclockwise and that might that my

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
counterclockwise and that might that my
plane<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.140> any<00:02:07.259> x<00:02:07.469> advantage<00:02:07.860> he<00:02:07.979> might<00:02:08.129> be

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
plane to any x advantage he might be

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
plane to any x advantage he might be
able<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> block<00:02:08.819> off<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.179> his<00:02:09.390> ramp

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
able to get a block off on his ramp

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.510 
able to get a block off on his ramp
we'll<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.739> looks<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.039> both<00:02:11.220> players

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
we'll see it looks like both players

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.160 
we'll see it looks like both players
going<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> assimilator<00:02:12.660> gate<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
every once in a while you'll see that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
every once in a while you'll see that
the<00:02:27.780> early<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.200> Gateway<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.830> push<00:02:29.069> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the early to Gateway kind of push but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.680 
the early to Gateway kind of push but
generally<00:02:29.730> you'll<00:02:29.879> see<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.150> builds<00:02:30.420> very

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
generally you'll see it builds very

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
generally you'll see it builds very
similar<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.310> pile<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.670> down<00:02:32.849> to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
similar to this pile on going down to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
similar to this pile on going down to
two<00:02:33.450> mine<00:02:33.629> minerals<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.379> bit<00:02:34.470> faster

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
two mine minerals a little bit faster

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.130 
two mine minerals a little bit faster
there<00:02:34.980> from<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.190> position<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:37.050> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
there from that position a little bit of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.020 
there from that position a little bit of
attack<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.099> looks<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.489> any<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:38.849> it's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
attack going on looks like any time it's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.490 
attack going on looks like any time it's
going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> try<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> pick<00:02:39.720> off<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> probe<00:02:40.260> there

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
going to try to pick off a probe there

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.009 
going to try to pick off a probe there
and<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.879> it'll<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.450> interesting<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:42.900> if

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and and it'll be interesting to see if

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.449 
and and it'll be interesting to see if
he<00:02:43.140> does<00:02:43.349> manage<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> block<00:02:43.950> his<00:02:44.069> front<00:02:44.310> door

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
he does manage to block his front door

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.460 
he does manage to block his front door
I'm<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.569> sure<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.840> he's<00:02:45.959> willing<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.290> dedicate

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
I'm not sure if he's willing to dedicate

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.339 
I'm not sure if he's willing to dedicate
a<00:02:46.769> probe<00:02:47.069> or<00:02:47.310> or<00:02:48.120> any<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.480> his<00:02:48.510> else<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.170> so

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
a probe or or any of his else to do so

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.619 
a probe or or any of his else to do so
we'll<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:50.040> he'll<00:02:50.849> need<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.150> course<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
we'll see he'll need of course the the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.050 
we'll see he'll need of course the the
two<00:02:52.019> salts<00:02:52.319> we'll<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.560> anyway<00:02:53.160> but<00:02:53.400> Cal<00:02:53.819> he's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
two salts we'll see anyway but Cal he's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690 
two salts we'll see anyway but Cal he's
been<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.300> hot<00:02:54.510> shot<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:54.989> his<00:02:55.110> team<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:56.670> a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
been the hot shot for his team really a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.729 
been the hot shot for his team really a
new<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> new<00:02:57.269> player<00:02:57.540> kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.319> hope<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
new a new player kind of the hope of the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.170 
new a new player kind of the hope of the
new<00:02:58.890> probably<00:02:59.220> Protoss<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.700> guess<00:02:59.849> I<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.120> out

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
new probably Protoss I guess I think out

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.490 
new probably Protoss I guess I think out
of<00:03:00.209> all<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> new<00:03:00.599> Protoss<00:03:00.930> I've<00:03:01.110> seen<00:03:01.290> he's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of all the new Protoss I've seen he's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.050 
of all the new Protoss I've seen he's
been<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> most<00:03:01.769> impressive<00:03:02.190> he's<00:03:02.849> been

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
been the most impressive he's been

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.330 
been the most impressive he's been
really<00:03:03.239> solid<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.409> would<00:03:04.860> say<00:03:04.950> he's<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.099> little

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
really solid I would say he's a little

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.130 
really solid I would say he's a little
inexperienced<00:03:05.519> because<00:03:06.000> everyone<00:03:06.900> small

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
inexperienced because everyone small

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.210 
inexperienced because everyone small
I'll<00:03:07.230> see<00:03:07.379> him<00:03:07.470> throw<00:03:07.650> away<00:03:07.800> games<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
I'll see him throw away games that I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.399 
I'll see him throw away games that I
think<00:03:08.430> he<00:03:08.519> should<00:03:08.670> lose<00:03:08.819> not<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.080> same<00:03:10.230> degree

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
think he should lose not the same degree

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.040 
think he should lose not the same degree

Templar quickly to go robotics facility
and<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:30.030> as<00:04:30.150> I'm<00:04:30.300> saying<00:04:30.510> at<00:04:30.630> robotics

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
and just as I'm saying at robotics

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.290 
and just as I'm saying at robotics

I<00:04:42.840> really<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:43.410> they'll<00:04:43.590> be<00:04:43.740> do<00:04:43.860> is

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
I really think they'll be do is

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.110 
I really think they'll be do is
advantage<00:04:44.310> looks<00:04:44.460> like<00:04:44.550> hell's<00:04:44.760> going<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.000> do

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
incoming river robot it looks like an

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.410 
incoming river robot it looks like an
observatory<00:05:09.840> going<00:05:10.260> up<00:05:10.380> for<00:05:11.280> Cal<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.090> also<00:05:12.360> an

observatory going up for Cal and also an

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.850 
observatory going up for Cal and also an
observatory<00:05:12.720> going<00:05:13.140> up<00:05:13.230> for<00:05:13.350> any<00:05:13.470> time<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.800> it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
observatory going up for any time so it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.960 
observatory going up for any time so it
looks<00:05:14.010> like<00:05:14.040> both<00:05:14.310> actually<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:14.790> kind<00:05:14.940> of

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
looks like both actually just kind of

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.760 
looks like both actually just kind of
going<00:05:15.150> for<00:05:15.390> an<00:05:15.450> anti<00:05:15.720> Dark<00:05:15.930> Templar<00:05:16.080> build<00:05:16.440> it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
going for an anti Dark Templar build it

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.870 
going for an anti Dark Templar build it
was<00:05:16.890> kind<00:05:17.100> of<00:05:17.160> hoping<00:05:17.310> we'd<00:05:17.550> see<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.730> little

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
was kind of hoping we'd see a little

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.240 
was kind of hoping we'd see a little
variation<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.480> an<00:05:19.260> early<00:05:19.620> dropship<00:05:20.070> and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
variation in an early dropship and

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.800 
variation in an early dropship and
taking<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.120> islands<00:05:21.450> but<00:05:21.570> i<00:05:21.630> guess<00:05:21.780> not

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
taking of the islands but i guess not

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.530 
taking of the islands but i guess not
anytime<00:05:22.590> immediately<00:05:23.490> pulling<00:05:23.790> back<00:05:23.940> he<00:05:24.300> sent

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
anytime immediately pulling back he sent

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.790 
anytime immediately pulling back he sent
that<00:05:24.660> probe<00:05:24.870> out<00:05:25.020> there<00:05:25.230> but<00:05:25.380> now<00:05:25.470> falling

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
that probe out there but now falling

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.770 
that probe out there but now falling
back<00:05:25.920> in<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.130> single<00:05:26.490> looks<00:05:27.390> like<00:05:27.510> he<00:05:27.690> was

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
back in a single looks like he was

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.210 
back in a single looks like he was
thinking<00:05:28.050> about<00:05:28.170> taking<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.560> secondary<00:05:28.950> and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
thinking about taking a secondary and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.460 
thinking about taking a secondary and
now<00:05:30.060> got<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.270> wait<00:05:30.450> until<00:05:30.600> he<00:05:30.900> has<00:05:31.020> an<00:05:31.170> equal

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
now got to wait until he has an equal

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.290 
now got to wait until he has an equal
Dragoon<00:05:31.740> force<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.460> attack<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:32.910> little<00:05:33.210> bit

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
with the probes as well to get a little

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.340 
with the probes as well to get a little
bit<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.640> advantage<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.330> check<00:05:37.230> the

bit of advantage so check the

bit of advantage so check the
