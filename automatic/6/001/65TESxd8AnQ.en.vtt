very much you can just of course that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
very much you can just of course that
kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.579> sound<00:01:32.820> isn't<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.900> you're<00:01:34.170> aiming

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
kind of sound isn't what you're aiming

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.330 
kind of sound isn't what you're aiming
for<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> long<00:01:35.850> run<00:01:36.439> but<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.740> start<00:01:38.070> there

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
for in the long run but you start there

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.600 
for in the long run but you start there
and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.180> next<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.430> work<00:01:41.430> on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and the next thing you do is work on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
and the next thing you do is work on
focusing<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.590> stream<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> air<00:01:44.009> that's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
focusing that stream of air that's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.060 
focusing that stream of air that's
coming<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:44.909> mouth

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.780 

and<00:01:52.640> as<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.480> make<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.960> smaller<00:01:54.860> stream<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.610> air

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
and as you make a smaller stream of air

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.150 
and as you make a smaller stream of air
you'll<00:01:56.000> find<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.530> actually<00:01:57.740> make

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
you'll find that you can actually make

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.530 
you'll find that you can actually make
blow<00:01:58.730> harder<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.650> harder<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.190> blow

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
blow harder and the harder you blow

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.320 
blow harder and the harder you blow
where<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.780> get<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> louder<00:02:03.500> sound<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.460> you

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
where you can get a louder sound and you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.419 
where you can get a louder sound and you
can<00:02:05.480> get<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.660> more<00:02:05.870> focused<00:02:06.140> sound<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
can get a more focused sound so the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.780 
can get a more focused sound so the
final<00:02:11.060> step<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.770> portion<00:02:12.770> will<00:02:13.610> be

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
final step of this portion will be

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.040 
final step of this portion will be
playing<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.960> note<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.350> listening<00:02:16.300> very<00:02:17.300> hard

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
playing a note and listening very hard

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.180 
playing a note and listening very hard
to<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> sound<00:02:21.080> changes<00:02:21.260> when<00:02:22.070> you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
to the how the sound changes when you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.750 
to the how the sound changes when you
change<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.610> stream<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.360> air<00:02:24.400> first<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.580> put

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
change the stream of air first you put

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.750 
change the stream of air first you put
it<00:02:25.820> up<00:02:25.940> there
