00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.150 
actually went from wasteland for about
an<00:04:15.690> hour<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:18.109> Beck's<00:04:19.109> bra<00:04:19.380> strap<00:04:19.680> length<00:04:19.890> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
an hour to Beck's bra strap length and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.730 
an hour to Beck's bra strap length and
the<00:04:20.880> reason<00:04:21.210> that<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.420> did<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.989> because<00:04:22.200> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
the reason that I did that is because I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.720 
the reason that I did that is because I
would<00:04:22.890> rather<00:04:23.040> have<00:04:23.870> helped<00:04:24.870> over<00:04:25.140> length<00:04:25.830> my

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
would rather have helped over length my

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.340 
would rather have helped over length my
were<00:04:26.910> ready<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:27.390> my<00:04:27.480> hair<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.690> be<00:04:27.810> healthy

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
were ready for my hair to be healthy

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.850 
were ready for my hair to be healthy
than<00:04:28.890> have<00:04:29.160> long<00:04:29.430> hair<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:31.170> length<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.590> still

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
than have long hair the length is still

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.230 
than have long hair the length is still
there<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.870> my<00:04:34.710> goal<00:04:34.920> was<00:04:35.220> not<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> even<00:04:35.850> reach

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
there and my goal was not to even reach

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.280 
there and my goal was not to even reach
waist<00:04:36.840> length<00:04:37.260> my<00:04:38.160> goal<00:04:38.450> was<00:04:39.450> basically<00:04:40.170> just

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
waist length my goal was basically just

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.590 
waist length my goal was basically just
to<00:04:40.620> reach<00:04:40.830> bra<00:04:41.190> strap<00:04:41.550> length<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.060> when<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.270> saw

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
to reach bra strap length and when I saw

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.670 
to reach bra strap length and when I saw
that<00:04:42.630> my<00:04:43.020> hair<00:04:43.260> had<00:04:43.940> reached<00:04:45.110> waist<00:04:46.110> length<00:04:46.410> I

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
that my hair had reached waist length I

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.190 
that my hair had reached waist length I
was<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.190> blown<00:04:47.430> away<00:04:47.550> but<00:04:48.450> at<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> same<00:04:48.900> time

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
was just blown away but at the same time

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.470 
was just blown away but at the same time
even<00:04:49.680> though<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.860> had<00:04:50.160> reached<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.850> limp<00:04:51.210> and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
even though I had reached that limp and

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.400 
even though I had reached that limp and
that<00:04:51.510> was<00:04:52.200> not<00:04:52.350> my<00:04:52.500> goal<00:04:53.840> my<00:04:54.840> hands<00:04:55.110> were

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
that was not my goal my hands were

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.180 
that was not my goal my hands were
scraggly<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.630> they<00:04:57.630> were<00:04:57.690> not<00:04:57.960> damaged<00:04:58.620> but<00:04:59.160> I

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
scraggly and they were not damaged but I

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.970 
scraggly and they were not damaged but I
would<00:04:59.550> rather<00:04:59.700> have<00:05:00.440> health<00:05:01.440> over<00:05:01.800> length

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
would rather have health over length

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.010 
would rather have health over length

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
like I see it so that was the reason for

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.370

my<00:05:04.140> major<00:05:04.350> cut<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.810> it'll<00:05:06.810> grow<00:05:06.930> back<00:05:06.960> it's
