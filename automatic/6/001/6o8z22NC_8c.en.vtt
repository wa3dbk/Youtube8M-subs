00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.750
 I'm already taking good things now 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.230
 deep pan she reminds here 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'll show you what's here. 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.789
 god god is not a magazine but this is such 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.080
 see deep as the us 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 hemispherical pan in many ways 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 such pans cook Chinese 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 chefs they really cook in the open 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.309
 fire when here comes down powerful 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.500
 a bunch of gas but we are not Chinese cooks we 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 normal guys and so we will 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.789
 cook on the stove and we get something 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:47.989
 the same thing is how to choose the world i 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.910
 I think that every normal man 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.180
 besides from some mandatory masculine 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 accessories like this 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 radio controlled cars which i am very 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.609
 love should be besides some 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 culinary gizmos and yet I assure wog 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.150
 you that god is now very modern 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.979
 and and rightly in terms of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.439
 cooking and longtime preparing 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 quickly and efficiently it is possible and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.310
 boil potatoes if you need to understand 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 because you can pour it water so 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.520
 here's how to look at here look at me 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.450
 electric stove because I'm here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 glass ceramics 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.049
 and which is infrared 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 heats up here now my arm 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.170
 hot 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 so it is obvious that for such a plate 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.600
 the lesson should be bottom flat so that it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.229
 effectively stood over people and perceived 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.970
 their heat and if you have a gas stove i 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.659
 By the way in gas I treat better than 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.780
 electricity 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.000
 then god may be rounded because 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.280
 then there is no need to do but 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.280
 flat now
