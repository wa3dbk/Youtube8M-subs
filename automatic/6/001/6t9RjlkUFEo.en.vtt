00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.890
 and then guys would I again and remember 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.200
 that I said in the last video that maybe 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.820
 to make a video about something that does not 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.960
 It has a lot to do with it. It has nothing to do with it. 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.570
 watch with a videogame 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.320
 So that's what I got here. 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 polaroid camera sam 600 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.730
 It's been a while since I was looking for something. 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.710
 so and I happened to stumble across a store 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.400
 I was walking downtown and I was 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.979
 meet my brother, my nephew 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.409
 I did not have time to test it yet. 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.780
 those who injects photos and at the time 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.430
 you download biotype is the instagram of the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.489
 life see life highlight 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:01.180
 I have not had time to test yet and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:03.400
 It 's late at night here at home and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.430
 It came to me is a correspondence and 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.799
 I imagine being the movie cut here I 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.560
 I do not want to turn if I was on the coast. 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:22.170
 address so you have to edit this 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 part is difficult to do below 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 I do not think a bubble 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.050
 I do not know, I do not have much information. 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.820
 still on this camera because it does not 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:46.600
 I also researched a lot 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:50.400
 ti information is in focus and closed in 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:56.710
 2008 and company called impossible 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 project that now in a project here in 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.360
 project 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 they bought everything they had in the factory 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.430
 there from the old cameras everything they light 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.530
 who checked the cameras are selling 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.110
 consul so new to my mother I 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.819
 I bought used same time cheap, right? 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.620
 the new functions with about three hundred 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:22.870
 four hundred reais her movie for who 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.150
 Do not know this type of bed does not have the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 battery inside does not have a 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.880
 battery is in the movie 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.420
 every time you buy a young 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.130
 battery you put it works 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.390
 I hope it works because it does not 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.640
 to function 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.200
 the sky will be a fiasco as I was a 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.110
 video with some people opening already vi 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.300
 some boxes with more or 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.250
 I do not know 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.250
 I wonder how it makes us stay here? 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:00.300
 A little paper here is cool. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.540
 we put near as I understand it has 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.090
 different arts for this here every 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 beyond this question the contacts of the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.670
 battery is inside the movie 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 and this movie has eight photos is one 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.130
 colorful is kind of expensive movie type 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.400
 cost me 60 reais not 40 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.400
 real 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.310
 I guess I know I'll put you 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.880
 because of this here inside the camera gives 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:46.630
 to see the camera or take it from the side 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.390
 has a little button there can not really 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.340
 see your contacts on the bottom 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.670
 Behind it is a mirror, not even if it is fine. 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.870
 dirty arises also still perhaps that I 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.470
 I really want that I want him 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.019
 stay with the partner well with a 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.760
 detail understands even knows then 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:16.170
 I'll totally put it here. 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:20.040
 so we 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:24.180
 the gun that masses 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.300
 It works my camera and she is now 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.220
 loaded with battery and with the movie 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.490
 Luis has already lit here. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.890
 wait it turns green 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.930
 to and now I can take a picture 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.260
 I will not take a photo now what eight 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.980
 photos for 40 reais or more until 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.470
 I'm not going to take a photo now, take a photo 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.470
 Then show it to you, but I know that. 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.190
 I wanted to show this company that 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.670
 bought Polaroid O tactical selling the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.450
 is the movie for her that's the one 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.730
 on here 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.350
 This is a colorful movie, what I know. 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.190
 as far as I know the quality is also not 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.720
 so good account of the original polaroid and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.210
 this type of film pilots jazz and then 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.400
 some years she also pays the photo goes 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.500
 erasing over time 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.330
 I do not know if this new one will work 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.960
 What I also know is that this type of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.730
 movie 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.000
 it was kind of experimental not a 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.860
 film type a technology still mastered 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.950
 is a new chemistry used to make 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.950
 these films tell the role inside 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.360
 so you have to stay the photo more or 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:47.770
 The less I hope it gets this way at the end. 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:53.500
 in this capacity that is speaking as 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.990
 use where to store this type of camera 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.960
 there is something else that we have 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.730
 watch the movie if you are not 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.220
 using hold inside a refrigerator 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.130
 something like that and if this movie 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.880
 company I still can not vote today 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.230
 because it reveals when it is hot to 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.350
 temperature will reveal 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:19.510
 So when you 're here, you 'll talk. 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.919
 works best between 13 and 28 degrees 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:26.350
 centigrade store it is but you 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.870
 will take the photo with the debate the photo that 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.870
 You do, you're open to it. 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.180
 here is the button of the 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.810
 or I know the trigger button is 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.670
 with her take her open take photos of 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.430
 take a picture you would see that the camera 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.760
 rear that come out and there's something 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.890
 capped the film that paulo no longer stay 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.880
 exposed you turn camera 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:52.160
 upside down because the light more 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.120
 strong will not end up having you here 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.680
 take the film and put it in your 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.840
 shirt something so it's a little 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.640
 warmer will already reveal the 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.760
 quality will be much better had already 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.070
 some videos showing the difference is 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.570
 much better 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.060
 so that's it, I'm very happy here 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.740
 with mine on my new toy 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.270
 I took stitching photography then 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.370
 I hope you enjoy being interested in 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.650
 this also photographing a good hobby 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.600
 what a beauty 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.280
 so that's it even more in the next 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.150
 video maybe the death of some photos 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.600
 for you guys 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.600
