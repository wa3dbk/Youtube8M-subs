00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220 
shot to be quite a significant player
but<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.600> an<00:01:00.780> apple<00:01:00.960> TV

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
but it's not just because of an apple TV

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
but it's not just because of an apple TV
device<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> iOS<00:01:02.489> ecosystem<00:01:02.640> and

has<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:34.979> shelved<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
has been shelved yeah I think it it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
has been shelved yeah I think it it's
actually<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.710> independent<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.700> easy

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
actually an independent thing it's easy

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
actually an independent thing it's easy
to<00:01:39.119> throw<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:39.600> together<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.259> my<00:01:40.890> guess

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to throw the two together but my guess

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
to throw the two together but my guess
is<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.820> TV<00:01:42.649> service<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.829> offer<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is any TV service they offer is going to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
is any TV service they offer is going to
work<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.030> existing<00:01:45.450> Apple<00:01:46.320> TV<00:01:46.649> boxes<00:01:46.979> too

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
work on existing Apple TV boxes too

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.990 
work on existing Apple TV boxes too
they're<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> make<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
they're not going to want to make it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
they're not going to want to make it
just<00:01:48.360> work<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> newest<00:01:49.079> devices<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
just work with the newest devices I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.710 
just work with the newest devices I
think<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.820> does<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.329> Crawford

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
think but what this does is Crawford

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
think but what this does is Crawford
pointed<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.890> allows<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.520> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pointed out is it allows them to have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
pointed out is it allows them to have
more<00:01:54.180> horsepower<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> run

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
more horsepower so that they can run

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.789 
more horsepower so that they can run
applications<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:57.390> things<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.049> overlay

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
applications and do things like overlay

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
applications and do things like overlay
content<00:01:59.520> from<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.820> program<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.079> another

content from one program on to another

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.749

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
program and do the kinds of things that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.780 
program and do the kinds of things that
frankly<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.479> saw<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.079> smart<00:02:04.469> TV<00:02:04.770> demos<00:02:05.100> 10<00:02:05.430> years

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
losing it but I will tell you that the

progress out of that company is

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.350 
progress out of that company is
significant<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.590> when<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.890> look<00:02:44.920> at<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
significant I think when you look at the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.970 
significant I think when you look at the
two<00:02:46.630> most<00:02:46.840> recent<00:02:46.959> products<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.860> they

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
two most recent products that they

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.949 
two most recent products that they
brought<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.250> they've<00:02:48.880> frankly<00:02:49.390> never<00:02:49.690> been

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
brought out they've frankly never been

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.809 
brought out they've frankly never been
better<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.500> yeah<00:02:50.920> they<00:02:51.130> blew<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.579> demand

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
better and yeah they blew it on demand

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.059 
better and yeah they blew it on demand
but<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.230> terms<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.500> forecasting

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
but and it's in terms of forecasting

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.220 
but and it's in terms of forecasting
demand<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.910> would<00:02:55.120> actually<00:02:55.450> put<00:02:55.630> i<00:02:55.840> would

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
demand but I would actually put i would

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.110 
demand but I would actually put i would
say<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.620> six<00:02:57.099> months<00:02:57.340> ago<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:58.000> you're

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
say that six months ago what you're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.050 
say that six months ago what you're
seeing<00:02:58.329> in<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.079> results<00:02:59.709> today

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
seeing in the in the results today

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.240 
seeing in the in the results today
represent<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.569> bad<00:03:02.440> decisions<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.099> were

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
represent the bad decisions that were

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.949 
represent the bad decisions that were
made<00:03:03.280> six<00:03:03.700> months<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.120> year<00:03:04.150> ago<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.690> I

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
made six months in a year ago and I

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.330 
made six months in a year ago and I
actually<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.620> they're<00:03:05.829> now<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.190> an

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
actually think that they're now on an

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.220 
actually think that they're now on an
upswing<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.239> may<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.480> seeing<00:03:07.810> kind<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.170> a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
upswing and we may be seeing kind of a

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.100 
upswing and we may be seeing kind of a
bottom<00:03:08.590> here<00:03:08.769> for<00:03:08.950> samsung<00:03:09.310> Bob<00:03:10.209> yeah<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:11.019> mean

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
bottom here for samsung Bob yeah I mean

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.630 
bottom here for samsung Bob yeah I mean
I<00:03:11.170> think<00:03:11.290> there<00:03:11.769> are<00:03:11.890> challenges<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.579> the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
I think there are challenges for the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.910 
I think there are challenges for the
smartphone<00:03:13.120> market<00:03:13.150> period<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.260> that's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
smartphone market period and that's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.400 
smartphone market period and that's
gonna<00:03:15.190> impact<00:03:15.819> Samsung<00:03:16.510> its<00:03:16.780> eventually<00:03:17.380> I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
gonna impact Samsung its eventually I

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.080 
gonna impact Samsung its eventually I
think<00:03:17.500> even<00:03:17.829> gonna<00:03:18.010> impact<00:03:18.370> Apple<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:18.970> what

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
think even gonna impact Apple but what

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.610 
think even gonna impact Apple but what
about<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.359> upgrade<00:03:19.660> cycle<00:03:20.079> that's<00:03:20.410> feeding

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
about the upgrade cycle that's feeding

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.620 
about the upgrade cycle that's feeding
up<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.459> don't<00:03:21.790> think<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.299> think<00:03:22.510> it's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
up and I don't think it is I think it's

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.030 
up and I don't think it is I think it's
lengthening<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.350> think<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.769> one<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
lengthening and I think that's one of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.530 
lengthening and I think that's one of
the<00:03:24.160> challenges<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.639> they're<00:03:24.880> facing<00:03:24.940> we're

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the challenges that they're facing we're

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.900 
the challenges that they're facing we're
also<00:03:25.690> seeing<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.280> high<00:03:27.459> end<00:03:27.489> where

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
also seeing that on the high end where

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.220 
also seeing that on the high end where
Samsung<00:03:28.299> has<00:03:28.450> focused<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.870> lot<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.109> their

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
Samsung has focused a lot of their

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.870 
Samsung has focused a lot of their
efforts<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:30.160> know<00:03:30.280> it's<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:30.849> very

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
efforts you know it's going to be very

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.030 
efforts you know it's going to be very
very<00:03:31.299> difficult<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.440> other<00:03:32.560> thing<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:32.829> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
very difficult the other thing is I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.440 
very difficult the other thing is I
think<00:03:33.099> we're<00:03:33.400> seeing<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.790> transformation<00:03:34.389> of

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
think we're seeing the transformation of

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.809 
think we're seeing the transformation of
Samsung<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.109> company<00:03:35.739> it's<00:03:36.489> gonna<00:03:36.670> be

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
Samsung as a company it's gonna be

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.220 
Samsung as a company it's gonna be
harder<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.299> harder<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.690> make<00:03:37.840> money<00:03:38.049> on

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
harder and harder to make money on

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.140 
harder and harder to make money on
devices<00:03:38.739> they're<00:03:39.160> looking<00:03:39.310> at<00:03:39.549> more<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.000> more

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
devices they're looking at more and more

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.479 
devices they're looking at more and more
on<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:40.569> semiconductor<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.500> components<00:03:42.340> side

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
on the semiconductor and components side

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.460 
on the semiconductor and components side
and<00:03:42.700> there's<00:03:42.910> better<00:03:43.180> margins<00:03:43.660> there<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.319> a

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and there's better margins there it's a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.110 
and there's better margins there it's a
much<00:03:44.829> different<00:03:45.069> company<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:45.790> sony

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
much different company just like sony

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.420 
much different company just like sony
has<00:03:46.359> evolved<00:03:46.780> i<00:03:46.870> think<00:03:47.049> samsung<00:03:47.560> may<00:03:48.069> follow<00:03:48.340> a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
has evolved i think samsung may follow a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.129 
has evolved i think samsung may follow a
similar<00:03:48.700> type<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.090> pet<00:03:49.209> what<00:03:49.329> about<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.810> brand

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
similar type of pet what about the brand

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.620 
similar type of pet what about the brand
i<00:03:50.349> mean<00:03:50.530> even<00:03:50.709> tom<00:03:51.069> brady<00:03:51.489> as<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.209> say

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
i mean even tom brady as you as you say

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.960 
i mean even tom brady as you as you say
that<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.310> earnings<00:03:54.609> announcement

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
that the the earnings announcement

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.000 
that the the earnings announcement
wasn't<00:03:55.209> great<00:03:55.389> but<00:03:55.569> tom<00:03:55.780> brady<00:03:56.079> saying<00:03:56.859> he

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
wasn't great but tom brady saying he

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.800 
wasn't great but tom brady saying he
threw<00:03:57.220> out<00:03:57.310> his<00:03:57.489> s6<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.329> switch<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.630> an<00:03:58.720> iphone

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
threw out his s6 to switch to an iphone

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.360 
threw out his s6 to switch to an iphone
and<00:03:59.319> that's<00:03:59.440> why<00:03:59.560> he<00:03:59.680> couldn't<00:03:59.889> turn<00:04:00.040> data

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
and that's why he couldn't turn data

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.550 
and that's why he couldn't turn data
over<00:04:00.669> to<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:00.940> NFL<00:04:01.120> investigators<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.380> might

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
over to the NFL investigators that might

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.669 
over to the NFL investigators that might
have<00:04:02.650> been<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.769> biggest<00:04:03.130> loss<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.549> week
