online<00:00:07.309> gameplay<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:09.120> found<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.260> far<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:11.010> when

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
online gameplay I found so far that when

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.299 
online gameplay I found so far that when
you<00:00:11.280> play<00:00:11.550> four<00:00:11.910> players<00:00:12.269> tops<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.309> online

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
you play four players tops in online

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.609 
you play four players tops in online
mode<00:00:14.820> that's<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.690> least<00:00:16.049> amount<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:17.119> at<00:00:18.119> least

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
mode that's the least amount of at least

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.429 
mode that's the least amount of at least
for<00:00:19.619> me<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.160> least<00:00:20.670> amount<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.300> lag<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
for me the least amount of lag that I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
for me the least amount of lag that I
can<00:00:22.710> handle<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> comes<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> gameplay

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
can handle when it comes to gameplay

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.450 
can handle when it comes to gameplay
I've<00:00:24.420> noticed<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.230> anytime<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> play<00:00:26.340> six

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
I've noticed that anytime you play six

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
I've noticed that anytime you play six
or<00:00:26.880> eight<00:00:27.090> players<00:00:27.449> at<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> same<00:00:27.840> time<00:00:28.230> online

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
or eight players at the same time online

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
or eight players at the same time online
they'll<00:00:29.039> live<00:00:29.580> becomes<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.269> bad

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
they'll live becomes really bad

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.920 
they'll live becomes really bad
specifically<00:00:31.439> because<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.790> game<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.600> host

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
specifically because this game is a host

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
specifically because this game is a host
player<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.399> call<00:00:35.670> duty<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
player it's like it's like call duty the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
player it's like it's like call duty the
the<00:00:36.360> players<00:00:36.690> host<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.320> game<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.160> if

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the players host the game so if the if

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
the players host the game so if the if
the<00:00:38.760> player<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.270> hosting<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.440> room

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the player that's hosting the the room

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
the player that's hosting the the room
the<00:00:41.399> match<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.120> has<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.870> bad<00:00:43.260> light

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the match it has like a really bad light

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
the match it has like a really bad light
connection<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:44.910> far<00:00:45.300> away

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
connection or they're really far away

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
connection or they're really far away
from<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> other<00:00:46.260> side<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> world

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
from you in the other side of the world

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
from you in the other side of the world
the<00:00:47.760> more<00:00:47.969> likely<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.719> game<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> be

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the more likely your game is going to be

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
the more likely your game is going to be
laggy<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> limit<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.510> amount<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
laggy so you want to limit the amount of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
laggy so you want to limit the amount of
players<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.610> game<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
players that you have in one game at the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
players that you have in one game at the
same<00:00:54.239> time<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
same time to kind of like a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.010 
same time to kind of like a
counterbalance<00:00:57.090> down<00:00:57.270> lag<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.840> game

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
counterbalance down lag that the game

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.010 
counterbalance down lag that the game
creates<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.850> players<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.809> month

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
creates so for players for me to month

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.450 
creates so for players for me to month

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
times so that's a total of six kills

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
times so that's a total of six kills
versus<00:01:44.520> four<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.939> they<00:01:45.090> automatically<00:01:45.570> won

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
versus four so they automatically won

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
versus four so they automatically won
and<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.649> primarily<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and that's primarily the thing that I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
and that's primarily the thing that I
want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> talk<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.530> when<00:01:49.530> you're<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
want to talk about when you're in a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
want to talk about when you're in a
battle<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> where<00:01:51.060> obviously<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
battle like this where obviously is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560 
battle like this where obviously is
pretty<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
pretty much one on two or two on one I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
pretty much one on two or two on one I
would<00:01:54.960> say<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.710> players<00:01:56.009> those<00:01:56.250> two<00:01:56.430> enemies

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
would say to players those two enemies

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
would say to players those two enemies
versus<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.750> teammate<00:01:58.140> only

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
versus me because my teammate only

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
versus me because my teammate only
killed<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.180> uphill<00:02:00.540> battle

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
killed one of them it's an uphill battle

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.770 
killed one of them it's an uphill battle
is<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.340> difficult<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.329> game<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
is very very difficult in this game to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.530 
is very very difficult in this game to
play<00:02:03.960> when<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.920> win<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
play when you're to win when you are the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.230 
play when you're to win when you are the
only<00:02:06.719> person

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
only person

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.150 
only person
fighting<00:02:08.170> against<00:02:08.500> two<00:02:08.649> people<00:02:08.950> at<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.069> same

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
fighting against two people at the same

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.650 
fighting against two people at the same
time<00:02:09.280> or<00:02:09.580> finding<00:02:09.729> two<00:02:09.970> or<00:02:10.060> three<00:02:10.240> people<00:02:10.420> at

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
time or finding two or three people at

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.600 
time or finding two or three people at
the<00:02:10.720> same<00:02:10.869> time<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.250> those<00:02:12.370> games

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the same time this is one of those games

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.550 
the same time this is one of those games
that<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.030> far<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.630> now<00:02:13.810> encountered<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that so far I have now encountered that

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.160 
that so far I have now encountered that
way<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:16.060> show<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.660> gap<00:02:16.870> between

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
way to actually show the gap between

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.600 
way to actually show the gap between
people<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.890> what<00:02:18.040> they're<00:02:18.130> doing<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
people that know what they're doing and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.309 
people that know what they're doing and
people<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.270> not<00:02:19.569> know<00:02:19.810> what<00:02:19.990> they're<00:02:20.080> doing

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
people that not know what they're doing

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.840 
people that not know what they're doing
not<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.770> saying<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:21.280> really<00:02:21.700> good

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
not that I'm saying that I'm really good

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.880 
not that I'm saying that I'm really good
at<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.030> game<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.870> I'm<00:02:22.959> saying<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.560> far

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
at this game that I'm saying that so far

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.290 
at this game that I'm saying that so far
I<00:02:24.100> have<00:02:24.280> pretty<00:02:24.670> much<00:02:24.760> figured<00:02:25.209> out

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
I have pretty much figured out

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.699 
I have pretty much figured out
everything<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.750> has<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.530> game

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
elements that have being able to figure

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.790

actually<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.380> top<00:05:30.590> player<00:05:30.860> when<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.160> comes<00:05:31.310> to

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
actually the top player when it comes to

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.520 
actually the top player when it comes to
overall<00:05:31.729> score<00:05:32.120> points<00:05:32.479> but<00:05:32.840> we<00:05:33.020> still<00:05:33.289> lose

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
overall score points but we still lose

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.380 
overall score points but we still lose
because<00:05:34.070> my<00:05:34.340> teammate<00:05:34.700> was<00:05:34.820> only<00:05:35.120> able<00:05:35.210> to

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
because my teammate was only able to

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.180 
because my teammate was only able to
kill<00:05:35.570> them<00:05:35.870> one<00:05:36.260> time<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.800> was<00:05:36.830> able<00:05:37.010> to

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.409 
kill them three times but like I said
hey<00:05:38.840> six<00:05:39.410> versus<00:05:39.800> four<00:05:39.830> scores<00:05:40.460> so<00:05:40.760> that's<00:05:41.300> my

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
hey six versus four scores so that's my

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
leave more balanced when it comes to two
