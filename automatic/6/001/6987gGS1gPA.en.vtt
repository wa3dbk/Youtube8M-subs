00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 Hello everyone, by name, you already understood 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 that today we will prepare cookies 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.240
 cookies which i am very original 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.400
 caused 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.400
 okay, let's go 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.360
 first we will melt the butter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.400
 mix it with cottage cheese 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.780
 and egg 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.460
 and sifted flour 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.390
 add baking powder and knead the dough 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.659
 she should be soft forcibly hammer 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.010
 flour neman put the dough in the fridge 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.680
 for 30 minutes 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.060
 although we need time to prepare our 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.340
 workplace 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.340
 pour flour on the table so that the dough to her 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 did not stick 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.619
 Now you need to roll out the dough thick floor 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 centimeter and cut circles 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.180
 I will do it the usual glass 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.150
 when all the circles are ready to fill 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.150
 their sugar 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.740
 now we put each circle two and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 dunk it with both sides into sugar 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.430
 don't be scared i didn't overdo sugar 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.040
 we should have something like 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.690
 triangles we lay them out on paper 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.250
 for baking and we will bake at a temperature 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.270
 200 degrees for about 15 minutes that's ready 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.680
 our cookie 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.680
