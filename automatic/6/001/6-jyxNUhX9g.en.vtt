00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.670
 finally an umpteenth vod on this pve patch and 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.990
 there we go it was a little bit 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.580
 the interface the new interface 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 absolutely beautiful 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 the league of legends in what will 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 arrive very soon in our country to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 all and on the real customer so 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 right now what strikes us is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 that everything has changed you can see it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 here it's not the same anymore if I 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 make every sibylline sentence everything has 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.849
 exchange 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 an interface a little higher we go 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.809
 to say purified a little more stylish a little bit more 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 aquatic is that makes think a theme 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.920
 a little more aquatic it's really 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 very very beautiful I think it's even 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.329
 prettier than the old style 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 finally here I like a lot 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 so we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.289
 the interface in terms of two suspects 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 both spel short champions 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.660
 I think it's more work 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.520
 so why not you can see on 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.350
 to whom I can see all of the one that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 I have four points on it since the 4 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010
 points on dry four times out of five that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 are illuminated here two points in the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 raid 0 in the e and 1 in the ultimate so 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 it was really nice to throw 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.659
 a quick look and no longer on a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 a little bit of memory 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 to know how much is passed on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.229
 and we're going to send back crystal slash 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.580
 in parentheses 4 and suddenly there we 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 was directly that I'm 4 so 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.180
 it's what's pretty good at 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
 level of ama order it 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 also changed a little bit too 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 so I think it's always 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 adjustable honestly I have not really 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.780
 test gold you do not do not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.430
 watch out for the greens behind it's because 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 we are on the ppe is not what is not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.759
 did not update it is a little bit 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 disgusting so I think if I put the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.680
 minimap scale if I do that that's it 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 reduced etc etc and we will put it back in 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.310
 big is not bad so 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.869
 so there's no problem with that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 always so friendly we can see 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
 also that there you have my camera but 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.670
 normally here we had the stuff to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.649
 adjust small settings etc 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 they were deported here so champion 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.640
 info here it is the shortcut it is 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 also to see it here what is at 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 board of flights and so also your bubble 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.630
 tabulation so there screen options 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 it's elusive and here camera setting so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 to know that here I'm locating the camera here 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.689
 quick game about it rags to know 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.940
 space if we stay pressed here it was 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.680
 just deported on the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.090
 on the map and that's why you 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.440
 can see when I'm here so 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.330
 I press the space here it stays 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.340
 to flash to show that I am I 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.000
 am doing ocs on the champion 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.160
 quite simply 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 then we have a big fat big 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.210
 improvement at the store level 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.670
 herself 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.260
 look at his voice the party do you a 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.940
 idea the recommended items are put under 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.580
 this form or in this form as 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.840
 you want to prevent here how it is 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.490
 wants if we want an overview or if 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 we want a detailed view 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.890
 simply 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.060
 I'm playing on seen overall I 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.580
 find it more interesting in any case 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.770
 on it and click in all items 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 here we come to this and it is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 find that the interface is really good 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.310
 thought here then these items per item with 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.870
 the tunes that cost etc etc and no 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.440
 as judy has seen this 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.630
 faster 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.770
 a quick look for varault 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.300
 to know said m so it's not bad and 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.220
 you can sort them out of course very 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.670
 easily so defense magic attack 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.900
 movement and consumables it's like this 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.980
 which was before except that it's a little 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.750
 faster since you have all who 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.090
 is already prepared so if I want 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.350
 quickly live if I say I'm going 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.840
 their attack on life if I click on it 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.010
 and I found all the items with 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.270
 live t he so it was really good 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.800
 makes the interface 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.540
 so when you're really used to 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.680
 other interfaces we say shit it's going 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.180
 maybe bothered me etc 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.590
 I'm hot since the beta honestly 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.730
 we do it quickly that's the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.470
 second time I come on the ppe 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.090
 I spent a lot of time actually 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.620
 but I think it's really enough 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.390
 intuitive fast enough so all that very 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.840
 very interesting and we should 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.700
 find 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.320
 very quickly is the new 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.400
 interface that really is not really 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.989
 wrong one can even do a search 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 directly here I am looking for I do not know 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.310
 me infiniti age 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.630
 infiniti g you see a kate movie that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.640
 arrives right away bar charfi which 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.140
 is very important that can be shot 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.370
 for those who do not want to search 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.390
 they are in it and abusive shit I 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.519
 no time I panic I do not say yes 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.230
 it takes aylward and to be able to 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.239
 poultry falls on world vision site 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.010
 world and no problem 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.620
 once again this trio you thought about 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.650
 everything then we also go by the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.360
 have to close this this video of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.800
 the display of scores that has changed in 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.420
 top right could see it's mostly 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.620
 a small line so some do not get there 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.910
 do not know for sure it's a little bit 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.070
 too long is not very good because 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.060
 before that was about pretty much 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.650
 in what I do to lassouts 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.300
 but it's still pretty 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.319
 friendly I really like me 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.970
 find that once again it's good 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.090
 thought it's pretty stylish so it starts 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.350
 with the thinks so there we are at 8 0 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.380
 at the game against bots and no glory 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.460
 the good but who has his dead insistence 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.020
 as usual then the crimes and 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.570
 behind the game time simply 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.820
 as well as the fps are made to control f 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.930
 here you have with the pig that is 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.889
 quite huge since we are sure 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.600
 pve as well as for your items cries 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.889
 a little bigger with your shortcuts 1 2 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.660
 3 when there is nothing that means 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.860
 it's a shortcut ksouri me it's 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.430
 a shortcut often in any case I am 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.410
 a repository 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.330
 it's a nice weather a button on the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.919
 aside that's why there is nothing 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.840
 of writing but otherwise one two three six 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.790
 I had then on one is there is a theme 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.900
 current here it will work and serves to 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.250
 everything is customizable as 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.380
 usually and in the cabins says that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.790
 can see here 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.100
 here it ends which is accessible here 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.850
 directly by pressing p that's it without 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.380
 problem 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.080
 here it was for the small interface 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.070
 the little change here I hope that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.639
 it will have answered a few questions 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.380
 also 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.910
 I kiss you on the tip of the muzzle 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.240
 and I say to you very soon like 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.240
 hold everything
