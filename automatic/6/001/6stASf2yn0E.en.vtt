00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.790
 why 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.049
 what is 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.310
 do not 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.200
 let's start good what we 're going to 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.079
 to do first is to have four frames of 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.860
 mdf as well as a maderita serves him 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.989
 okay 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.570
 it's going to be a painting that is going to be composed 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.990
 of four pieces and all will have a 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 design that come together 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.960
 as if they were non- rainbow circles 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.360
 continuous errant 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 this is a pretty good project for 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 decorate our homes to house 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 our times like to do it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 also as a pretty clear gift 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.219
 practical and recycled and above all you know 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 that what I like is that we're going 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.059
 to teach how they can do the dimension 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.369
 in these pictures it is no longer a picture 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.399
 flat but is a box with text relief 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.250
 let's see I hear you look what we 're going to 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.580
 need is paper pulp which 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 let's mix with vinyl cola we're going 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.600
 to result a mass like that enough 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.600
 flexible ok we mix it in the blender 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.330
 what we are going to do is apply with the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.390
 vinyl 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.390
 in our the surface of the frame 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.860
 and then 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.240
 let's take a piece 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.180
 the papier mache and we're going to extend it 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.390
 the surface 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.940
 of our frame so that it sticks well 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.760
 now the papier mache is wet 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.920
 so you can work easier and well 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 Now I'm going to show you the texture that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.650
 with a fork we can do 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.000
 easily 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.000
 let's go squeezing 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.989
 and regularly 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.579
 And you can also make this texture 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:18.450
 container but you can also be 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:20.510
 textures with a clear pencil and with this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.219
 Now you can be what is highlighted if 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.049
 we put it here if we want 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.319
 that we have a little more son 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:32.489
 we can put more glue and we're going 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.620
 with your hand adjusting it ok and we're going 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.230
 giving the shape that we want 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.510
 Now this is the original color of this 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.120
 shape is already when it is dry but you 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.590
 proposal is light white since it is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.959
 dry we can paint the color that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.669
 we want to see where we are going 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.150
 to start good what we are going to do 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:54.299
 first is to have four mdf frames 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.459
 same also a little marshmallow serves them ok 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.069
 it's going to be a painting that is going to be composed 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.470
 of four pieces and all will have a 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.440
 design that come together 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.410
 as if they were non- rainbow circles 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.780
 continuous 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.880
 this is a pretty good project for 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.560
 decorate our homes to house 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.810
 our times or to do it too 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.420
 as a clear gift is something quite 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.730
 practical and recycled above all you know 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.560
 that what I like is that we're going 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.960
 to teach how they can do the dimension 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.060
 in these boxes a is not a flat picture 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.910
 but it is a box with text highlighted to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.820
 see I hear you and look at me what we 're going to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.090
 need is paper pulp which the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.160
 let's mix with vinyl cola we're going 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.930
 to result a mass like that enough 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.930
 flexible ok we mix it in the blender 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.660
 what we are going to do is apply with the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.950
 vinyl on our surface the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.950
 frame that the abundant 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.410
 and then 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.820
 let's take some pieces 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.800
 and papier-mâché and we're going to extend it 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.950
 the surface 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:13.620
 of our frame so that it sticks well 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.620
 now the papier mache is wet 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.480
 so you can work easier and well 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.459
 Now I 'm going to show you the texture that 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.590
 with a fork we can do 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.590
 we will easily go squeezing 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.590
 and regularly 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.150
 And you can also make this texture 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:39.050
 container but you can also be 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:40.999
 textures with a clear pencil and with this 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.610
 Now you can do what relief is and 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:45.560
 in fact we put it here like this 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.770
 we want us to stay a little more fixed 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.969
 we can put more glue and what 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.039
 we go with the hand arranging it ok and you 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.169
 we are giving the form that we 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.419
 we want now this is the original color 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.340
 in this way it is already when it is dry 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.680
 but you for your proposal is blank 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.729
 Of course, because it's dry, we can paint it 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.729
 of the color that we want
