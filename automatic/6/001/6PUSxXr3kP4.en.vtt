00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 hi to all the boys I am then 95 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.520
 I black and today as you see from 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.290
 images we are here with a review of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320
 a very high end video card 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.470
 we are talking about the geforce gtx state 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.720
 80th to nvidia graphics card than to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.080
 moment represents the graphic card 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.059
 fastest single GPU ever made 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 in fact, even the competition is not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 able to make a video Tryst 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 fast and handsome in games 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 the card offers pure performance 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 speed up and play at 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 any video game with settings 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 ultrÃ  and resolutions up to 4k 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 in fact the card created with the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 final version of the cartier gk 110 to 28 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.410
 nanometers and is composed of seven v.le 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 comma billion transistor obvious 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 we could give each transistor a bus a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.539
 one every person on earth 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 exact or almost and precisely the 7 80th you have a 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.310
 total of 1880 bio cuda cores and 240 in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 texture and comparison of the titan 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:23.070
 who has 200 2688 la7 83 also enjoys of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.040
 an additional smx enabled 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 therefore at 192 shaders and 16 units of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 texture more 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.299
 moreover the vidia has also increased the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 GPU frequencies change from 837 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.509
 gtx titan megahertz to 875 billion 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.270
 in most loads of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.610
 plus job without forget the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.009
 gpu boost 2.0 which will increase 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.320
 further maintaining the frequencies 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.400
 always a maximum temperature of 83 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280
 degrees 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.750
 as far as memory is concerned instead 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.270
 nvidia didn't trust chips with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 frequency of one thousand and 500 megahertz set 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.170
 at 1,750 for a total of 7000 meilleurs 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 actual is a nice sweet up to 3 and 336 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.689
 gb 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.239
 according to the choice you probably have 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.000
 will limit the debate to the use of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.320
 3 GB of memory ddr5 the exact half of the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.030
 six jigs present on the gtx titan 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.080
 at the moment there are no problems in the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.390
 handle 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.170
 1080p action on three screens and the impact 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.480
 hd but in the future the amount of memory 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 gddr5 will become a major problem in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.960
 based on how the new ones will develop 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.510
 games regarding 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.180
 power consumption in envy 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.790
 indicates a tdp of 250 watts equal to that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.410
 of the titan and attitude 80 ne 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.400
 it follows that the same connectors 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.500
 auxiliaries 8 6 pins of the 70 of the titan 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.950
 here instead you are seeing some beige 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.300
 of the gtx 180 of ai on some games between 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 the most famous of the moment 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.230
 reminding us however that in the latter 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.620
 days the new drivers came out 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.060
 further increasing performance 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.100
 we would like to remind you of the images 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.400
 were taken from the tech site 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.650
 tomorrow we thank the first bank 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.160
 what you are seeing is to fight 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.240
 the 4 that as you see the video card 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.670
 gtx been so many ai is compared with the 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:23.550
 Rs 9290 hicks who represents the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.550
 prominent video card of the md as 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.220
 you can see on the battlefield 4 la7 80th 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.400
 ai holds an average framerate of 90 fps in 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 1080p 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.810
 therefore a framerate is rather high 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 instead here you are seeing a launch of 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.470
 crysis as you see in this too 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.920
 haiti's la7 80 game is neither an average nor 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.840
 1080p of 90 frames per second 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.730
 so a card shows a card 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.940
 very generous from the point of view of the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.380
 fps and is capable of holding everything to one 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.410
 very high graphics 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.320
 all the graphic effects obviously then 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.519
 let's put it up for auction and one 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:13.110
 of the last titles which is very heavy 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:16.859
 in fact here in the ultra we say the fps 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.680
 fall on 80 in 1080p and in any case 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.479
 always testifies to resign the summit 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.390
 when can 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.419
 in this case we see the given md 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.979
 to the optimization is in advantage of two 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.400
 ps 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.370
 well it doesn't change anything 60 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.620
 so to then move on to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.340
 maximum and minimum temperatures where 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.840
 we can see the goodness of the sink 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.150
 references of nvidia that allows us 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.440
 to hold a maximum temperature of 80 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.229
 2 degrees in full load and in idols 38 degrees 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.930
 and the 82 degrees are also intended for 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.729
 when the frequencies are reached 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.440
 1200 there is 1200 meyers so it really is 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.370
 a remarkable thing counting that for 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.320
 now at the locked voltage at 1.221 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.090
 volt 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.580
 in conclusion it is a card 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.020
 video that as already reiterated at the beginning 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.440
 video is aimed at an audience 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.300
 particularly demanding indeed the 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.860
 price of this video card is around 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.410
 around 600 euros 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.410
 then of course of penalty according to the 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.260
 shop where you will buy it but this is the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.130
 average price especially with heat sink 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.539
 stop while the custom ones will have gods 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.070
 prices that may vary depending on 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:38.710
 of the company that distributes them is fine 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.910
 guys this video is coming to an end 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.070
 I remind you to put it like 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.490
 share our video if there is 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.470
 so liked here a black greeting 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.470
 and apple 95
