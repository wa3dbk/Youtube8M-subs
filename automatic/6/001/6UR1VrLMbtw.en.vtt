00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.630
 Then welcome to the crazy 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.160
 inspired once again by the ex-husband 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.870
 is here because it will give a help 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 zico club 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.449
 I've been recording for some days already. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.430
 mini videos that in the water with the goal 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.830
 said that we come from there in a long 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 inspired shopping and then I wanted to test 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 how it works 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 dive in to take photos to do 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 underwater video for me this is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 very new news in Brazil then 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 wanted to test and if it really worked 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.450
 that's when we just said it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 that I'm going to leave those mini videos that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.829
 I made you guys to see with the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.899
 quality because they are very cool are 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 several videos several days ago that I made 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.140
 video and then I wanted him to help 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.160
 little to tell the difference of gopro silva 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 and black then the difference between 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 silva and black that the top of the line is that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.120
 black has a number of megapixels 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 bigger than silvia if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 They are 3MP while reversing 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.890
 in 10 for photo 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.840
 the two make 1,080 only that black yet 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 makes 4k what air 3.980 for something 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 maximum resolution has nothing to do with tv 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.580
 that almost 4 card 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.960
 through it which is the silver today is 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 that the most people buy because the most 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.509
 into account as well because it will also more 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.610
 only such an absurd difference is the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.229
 black has an input of a capture of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 A little better light if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 I think it has a slightly higher angle of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.000
 lens aperture is hardly 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.049
 annoying because one sees much improvement 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.689
 bigger 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.220
 It 's incredible here we are. 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.200
 accustomed to business to take photo 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 front and right grip type but a little 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.470
 here o 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.079
 she's right here I put mine 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.899
 hand on the side you can still see the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.170
 my mother is on the side she picks up 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 exactly the 180 is and that's why a lot 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 People talk but she has no display. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 I was a little tense with this light not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 I can see what I 'm up against but in the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.679
 It's true that she has this very angle. 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 broad 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.080
 Where you hit you will pick up 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.610
 are you wanting that has no stress but 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.410
 anyway to whoever has a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.600
 display separate what you buy for 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.000
 to dock it has several accessories 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.560
 They have legal head guys outta there 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.830
 disney for roller coasters have a 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.300
 Default We have a bad guy 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 some also have a long inspired 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.630
 shopping has a buoy for you to bring 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.460
 she marries in the frame of the case the proof 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.950
 I gave into the pool or 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.440
 transport the beach because it is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 she fall she does not sink you do not lose 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.850
 she floats like this with a float 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.180
 yellow will put the dollar on the dollar 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.250
 on the maxwell board I want to ask what 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.680
 it 's a business so you're doing fine 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.040
 with the cane you know if you up there 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.190
 cup she then gets high point 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.590
 great cop is the people doing the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 is very fun the good is that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.220
 she has that accessory then policy 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.800
 about its image on the market because of 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.630
 accessories can be used in any 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.420
 thing out of the water in the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.070
 image stabilization somewhat absurd 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.180
 You have now seen from my last 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.560
 videos 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.300
 The folks are talking a lot about ours. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.610
 with great camera quality is 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.410
 using go pro she stabilizes a lot 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.330
 When we walk in a maintained 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.950
 usually this camera would do so she 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.470
 do not do such a thing there is much more 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.620
 subtle does not leave you that vertigo of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.390
 guy I'm getting dizzy is not I'm 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.460
 loving this real camera that I 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.180
 I really like the lack of the display that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.959
 I felt I'm not feeling anymore and it's just 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.270
 love 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.490
 the amateur camera he spoke part 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.470
 technique because it's not me I'm going 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.450
 leave you with the mini videos that I 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.230
 I did during those sunny days here in 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.920
 florida 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.920
 let's see there 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.110
 and then people like the videos will stay 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.880
 in a video right? 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.280
 I put some of the photos for you 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.770
 Also that I took were very cool. 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.720
 I really love people at least from my 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.400
 personal profile my friends amaro 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410
 even my family also always 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.320
 I always liked eating new beautiful photo no 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.770
 I know it's clear, too. 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.510
 very beautiful but that's it folks if you 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.980
 if you also want to have a 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.540
 equipment like that we sell 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.890
 We inspired a long shopping us 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.050

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.640
