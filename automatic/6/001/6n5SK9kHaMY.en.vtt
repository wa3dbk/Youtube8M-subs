00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
the world from the state of relative

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.140 
the world from the state of relative
inexperience<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.950> what<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.819> learned<00:02:22.030> from

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
inexperience and what I learned from

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.000 
inexperience and what I learned from
that<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.719> feel<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.409> can<00:02:23.560> sometimes

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that I I feel like I can sometimes

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.649 
that I I feel like I can sometimes
channel<00:02:24.549> some<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.939> knowledge<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.540> know

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
channel some of that knowledge you know

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.929 
channel some of that knowledge you know
backwards<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.829> know<00:02:26.920> some<00:02:27.129> of<00:02:27.159> what<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.400> found

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
backwards you know some of what I found

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.059 
backwards you know some of what I found
out<00:02:28.150> later<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.599> because<00:02:29.230> it'll<00:02:29.769> loop<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> back

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
out later on because it'll loop it back

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.250 
out later on because it'll loop it back
around<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.879> somebody<00:02:31.299> was<00:02:31.750> younger<00:02:32.049> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
around this and somebody was younger and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.630 
around this and somebody was younger and
doesn't<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.890> advantage<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.489> I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
doesn't have the advantage of that I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.050 
doesn't have the advantage of that I
think<00:02:33.939> it's<00:02:34.090> um<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.889> it's<00:02:36.340> really

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
think it's um you know it's it's really

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.879 
think it's um you know it's it's really
interesting<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.689> really<00:02:37.719> like<00:02:38.019> doing<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.439> again

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
interesting I really like doing it again

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.759 
interesting I really like doing it again
I<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.219> a<00:02:39.250> certain<00:02:39.549> satisfaction<00:02:39.700> from<00:02:40.359> seeing

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
I get a certain satisfaction from seeing

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.789 
I get a certain satisfaction from seeing
people<00:02:42.659> from<00:02:43.659> watching<00:02:43.900> people<00:02:44.349> learn<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
people from watching people learn I

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.129 
people from watching people learn I
think<00:02:45.609> most<00:02:45.790> learning<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.239> done<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.750> your<00:02:47.019> own

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
think most learning is done on your own

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.349 
think most learning is done on your own
it<00:02:47.620> must<00:02:47.829> be<00:02:47.919> real<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.609> real<00:02:48.639> actual<00:02:49.060> learning

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
it must be real the real actual learning

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.080 
it must be real the real actual learning
is<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:50.169> way<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.889> absorb<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.489> information<00:02:51.609> is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
is the way you absorb the information is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.270 
is the way you absorb the information is
something<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.569> by<00:02:52.720> yourself<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:54.099> you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
something you do by yourself that you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.179 
something you do by yourself that you
know<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.730> teacher<00:02:54.939> can<00:02:55.659> present<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.980> make

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
know the teacher can present it and make

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.589 
know the teacher can present it and make
it<00:02:57.220> available<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.120> have<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.389> do<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
it available that you have to do the

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.960 
it available that you have to do the
work<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.079> I<00:02:59.769> get<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.340> chance<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.700> see<00:03:00.849> how

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
work so I get to a chance to see how

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.909 
work so I get to a chance to see how
different<00:03:01.299> people<00:03:01.510> approach<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.230> process

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
different people approach that process

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.509 
different people approach that process
of<00:03:03.040> learning<00:03:03.189> teaching<00:03:03.879> ourselves<00:03:05.519> and

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
of learning teaching ourselves and

really liked it sort of you know sort of

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.160 
really liked it sort of you know sort of
inspiration<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.180> he<00:05:06.390> would<00:05:06.540> be<00:05:06.660> interesting

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
inspiration on he would be interesting

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.610 
inspiration on he would be interesting
to<00:05:07.200> put<00:05:08.040> together<00:05:08.130> something<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:09.230> maybe<00:05:10.230> find

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
to put together something and maybe find

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.470 
to put together something and maybe find
a<00:05:10.740> way<00:05:10.890> to<00:05:11.340> disseminate<00:05:11.790> some<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.300> my<00:05:12.420> music

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
a way to disseminate some of my music

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.330 
a way to disseminate some of my music
that<00:05:13.110> way<00:05:13.350> rather<00:05:13.710> than<00:05:13.890> through<00:05:14.280> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
that way rather than through the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.730 
that way rather than through the
commercial<00:05:15.060> record<00:05:15.480> business<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:16.170> think

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
commercial record business I think

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.680 
commercial record business I think
that's<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.980> wave<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.490> future<00:05:17.580> as<00:05:18.300> far<00:05:18.570> as

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
that's the wave of the future as far as

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.650 
that's the wave of the future as far as
getting<00:05:19.170> your<00:05:19.380> music<00:05:19.650> out<00:05:19.770> there<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:21.180> think

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
getting your music out there and I think

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.450 
getting your music out there and I think
the<00:05:21.840> recordings<00:05:22.410> are<00:05:22.620> becoming<00:05:23.070> more<00:05:23.310> like

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
the recordings are becoming more like

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.100 
the recordings are becoming more like
calling<00:05:23.940> cards<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:24.390> other<00:05:24.750> opportunities

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
calling cards for other opportunities

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.230 
calling cards for other opportunities
and<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.160> hope<00:05:26.340> do<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:26.640> know<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.790> play<00:05:27.060> more
