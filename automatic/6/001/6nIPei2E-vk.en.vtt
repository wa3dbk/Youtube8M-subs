00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.559
 what's new youtube community 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.259
 343 and we're already a week away from 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.050
 between 2012 with the world premiere of 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.270
 40th century as it went on all week 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.369
 the same madman keeps filtering every time 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.559
 more and more halo 4 and it seems that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.239
 Microsoft has not yet crouched but 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.070
 Well the leaks are the 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.110
 following and this time they are leaks 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.270
 more serious so in this video 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.100
 expect a lot of really good content 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.190
 in this first image we will see what it says 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.460
 as if it already had its floral power 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.040
 fire of hope powell fire sniper laurel 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
 4000 now 25 blocked 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640
 we see treaties that says something about how your 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.370
 options to finish what the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 assault rifle the one with m &amp; r the grenade 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.540
 auto fragmentation I included that says that 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.880
 it's a new armor skill 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.620
 because it was not 15 I have no idea 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.500
 how can fire power work 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.140
 tactical package is not required and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.729
 below says none that is a 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.799
 media update here we see 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.180
 new armor skills but not 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.249
 inside the game here has 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.640
 selected the self- interest but the 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.159
 true 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.590
 managed to decipher what is after addition 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.840
 promises to regeneration fields 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.510
 hologram hard drive 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.540
 that would translate it as a shield of light 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.060
 hard or light tense active camouflage and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.190
 package of propellers I do not know what you mean 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.690
 with all these things package of propellers 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.340
 it could be the new name for the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.890
 jetpack or something like that since 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 our image we see 15 tactical package 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.060
 that you have selected at this time 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.740
 the firepower that possibly is 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.970
 stop your firepower be more 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.860
 strong or something like that 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.130
 we see the result that is like 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.140
 extra supplies grenadier to warnes that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.750
 it's like consciousness I have no idea of â€‹â€‹a 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 which shield should be referred these 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 extras and it 's really not deciphering 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.660
 I do not know what says part says existence or 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.300
 something like that 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 the truth is not enjoying here we see 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.050
 an elite image of assault shooting 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.940
 against the Spartans that seems to be of 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.100
 blue color the hurdes are very 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 exiled from water for the quality of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.289
 image 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.120
 I can not banish much more that is in 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 the web map in this image we see the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.650
 target locator or at least something 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 quite similar and there is the locator 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 of targets this one 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.770
 in match making thing that never for nothing 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.510
 we saw in halo reach so this is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.270
 could be the target locator for 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.490
 first time in the multiplayer mode of 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.500
 halo or could it be something else not 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.290
 I have an idea and here we see what it looks like 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.690
 be a new style covenant rifle I do not know 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 whether it's the halo 3 rifle beat or the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.880
 focus rifle halo reach the truth 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.310
 I personally much prefer my 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.990
 own opinion the halo ace 3 rifle 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.780
 that they reach halo scope rifle 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.310
 because it went from useless to annoying 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.710
 depending on the side that was 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.590
 being used if they attacked him was annoying 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.420
 and it was used was useless as it is let in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.790
 the comments that far from you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.680
 they prefer to be reflected again and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.530
 three or yale focus rifles the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.210
 rings seems my own opinion a little 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.110
 more to the rich focus rifle but 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.720
 everything can happen is a very rocky place 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.430
 with quite a lot of very cool structures 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.520
 style to someone but rock texas 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.580
 in this picture we see the normal magnum 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.320
 pointing to the floor and trying to be 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.270
 changed by some other weapon if 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.280
 we judge by the actions of the player 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.260
 since it seems to indicate that it is for the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.910
 radio with the armh you want 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.740
 change but here we see the design of the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 magnum itself seems to be hitting 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.960
 towards the floor for no reason and one of 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.060
 my favorite images is this here 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.980
 we see a spartan forcing the network with 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 possibly to confirmation but 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 It is also very similar to the network is 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.760
 aiming to cope and we see what 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.130
 it seems to be a goes there good what 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.810
 seems to be not what is a like and in 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.060
 front parked without any pilot 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.560
 it seems to be just walking the map and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.170
 is pointing a structure 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.150
 only with the special ship weapon and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.530
 that is all community hopefully they have 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.420
 liked the video 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.790
 Give it a thumbs up if it was like that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.230
 subscribe you form information and say 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.030
 in the comments that seem to 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.710
 you all this new information 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.600
 Well, I say goodbye to you and even the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.600
 next bertran 343
