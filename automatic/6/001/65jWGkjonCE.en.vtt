00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
simple so go ahead and open flash I'm

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
simple so go ahead and open flash I'm
using<00:00:34.770> cs4<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.820> okay<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.360> using<00:00:36.510> an

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
using cs4 it's okay if you're using an

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
using cs4 it's okay if you're using an
earlier<00:00:36.960> version<00:00:37.380> that's<00:00:37.860> fine<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:39.079> cs4

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
earlier version that's fine too but cs4

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
earlier version that's fine too but cs4
is<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> little<00:00:41.160> different<00:00:41.489> if

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

you're<00:00:42.000> using<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.600> previous<00:00:43.020> version<00:00:43.850> but<00:00:44.850> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you're using a previous version but if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.410 
you're using a previous version but if
there's<00:00:45.120> anything<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:46.789> you<00:00:47.789> know<00:00:47.820> really

symbol<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.440> there's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.800> few<00:02:37.280> different<00:02:37.640> types

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
symbol and there's a few different types

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.420 
symbol and there's a few different types
assembled<00:02:38.390> there's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.600> movie<00:02:38.960> clip<00:02:39.430> graphic

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
assembled there's a movie clip graphic

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.940 
assembled there's a movie clip graphic
and<00:02:40.700> button<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:42.410> today<00:02:42.680> we're<00:02:42.920> just

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
and button and for today we're just

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.120 
and button and for today we're just
going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> select<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.850> movie<00:02:44.720> clip<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.830> do

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
going to select a movie clip so to do

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.820 
going to select a movie clip so to do
that<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:47.570> can<00:02:48.520> hit<00:02:49.520> f8<00:02:50.560> which<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.740> the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
that you can hit f8 which is the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.620 
that you can hit f8 which is the
shortcut<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.640> definitely<00:02:53.240> something<00:02:53.510> to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
shortcut for it definitely something to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.000 
shortcut for it definitely something to
remember<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.530> using<00:02:54.740> that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
remember you're going to be using that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.070 
remember you're going to be using that
quite<00:02:55.430> often<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> here's<00:02:59.150> where<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.930> can

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
quite often so here's where you can

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.270 
quite often so here's where you can
choose<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:01.160> type

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
choose what type

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.080 
choose what type
and<00:03:03.370> we're<00:03:03.790> gonna<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:04.270> give<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.840> name<00:03:06.090> they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
and we're gonna just give it a name they

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.390 
and we're gonna just give it a name they
may<00:03:07.240> become<00:03:07.770> semi-important<00:03:08.770> later<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.160> but

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
may become semi-important later on but

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160 
may become semi-important later on but
for<00:03:09.580> now<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:10.120> really<00:03:10.360> doesn't<00:03:10.780> matter<00:03:10.870> what

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
for now it really doesn't matter what

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.620 
for now it really doesn't matter what
you<00:03:11.230> name<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.740> it's<00:03:12.520> all<00:03:12.700> how<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.180> choose<00:03:13.600> to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
you name it it's all how you choose to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.330 
you name it it's all how you choose to
name<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:16.200> okay<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.260> now<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.680> converted<00:03:18.160> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
name it okay so now it's converted and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.230 
name it okay so now it's converted and
we're<00:03:18.430> ready<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> animate<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.800> okay<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.850> we

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
we're ready to animate it okay so we

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.820 
we're ready to animate it okay so we
need<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.570> look<00:03:22.840> at<00:03:22.990> our<00:03:23.110> take<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> look<00:03:23.650> at<00:03:23.740> our

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
need to look at our take a look at our

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.220 
need to look at our take a look at our
timeline<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.480> brief<00:03:25.720> explanation<00:03:28.230> by

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
timeline just a brief explanation by

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.570 
timeline just a brief explanation by
default<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.740> set<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.980> 24<00:03:30.760> fps<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:33.250> in

default is set to 24 fps I think in

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.030 
default is set to 24 fps I think in
previous<00:03:33.940> versions<00:03:34.510> default<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.020> 12<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.830> can't

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
previous versions default is 12 it can't

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.400 
previous versions default is 12 it can't
be<00:03:36.190> certain<00:03:36.610> though<00:03:36.790> but<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.750> okay<00:03:38.140> if<00:03:38.260> it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
be certain though but it's okay if it's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.920 
be certain though but it's okay if it's
not<00:03:39.570> 24<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:41.020> means<00:03:41.700> 24<00:03:42.700> frames<00:03:43.120> per<00:03:43.300> second

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
not 24 just means 24 frames per second

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.710 
not 24 just means 24 frames per second
which<00:03:44.110> means<00:03:44.140> every<00:03:44.739> 24<00:03:45.250> frames<00:03:45.610> that'll<00:03:46.600> be

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
which means every 24 frames that'll be

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.400 
which means every 24 frames that'll be
one<00:03:46.930> second<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:49.270> can<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.870> change<00:03:50.200> it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
one second and you can you can change it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.640 
one second and you can you can change it
to<00:03:50.560> whatever<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.130> want<00:03:51.400> however

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
to whatever you want however

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.699 
to whatever you want however
how<00:03:53.069> you<00:03:53.129> want<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:54.060> know<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.290> will

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
how you want but know that that will

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.530 
how you want but know that that will
definitely<00:03:55.950> affect<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:57.390> speed<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:58.049> your

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
definitely affect the speed of your

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.410 
definitely affect the speed of your
animation<00:04:01.010> so

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
animation so

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.890 
animation so
we're<00:04:04.230> going<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.760> right-click<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:06.240> our<00:04:06.480> symbol

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
we're going to right-click on our symbol

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.840 
we're going to right-click on our symbol
and<00:04:07.770> click<00:04:08.400> create<00:04:08.640> motion<00:04:09.120> tween

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
and click create motion tween

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.000 
and click create motion tween
and<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.180> course<00:04:11.450> by<00:04:11.660> default<00:04:12.110> since<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.500> 24

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
and of course by default since it's 24

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.670 
and of course by default since it's 24
frames<00:04:13.520> per<00:04:13.700> second<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.960> will<00:04:15.110> automatically

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
frames per second it will automatically

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.710 
frames per second it will automatically
assume<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:19.640> shortest<00:04:20.090> animation<00:04:20.630> will

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
assume that the shortest animation will

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.340 
assume that the shortest animation will
be<00:04:20.870> one<00:04:21.410> second<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.880> put<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.600> at<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.810> 24th

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
be one second and put you at the 24th

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.070 
be one second and put you at the 24th
frame<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.790> can<00:04:25.970> always<00:04:26.090> move<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.720> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
frame and you can always move that to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.570 
frame and you can always move that to
however<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.710> want<00:04:27.890> but<00:04:28.100> we're<00:04:28.310> going<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.490> go

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
however you want but we're going to go

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.960 
however you want but we're going to go
back<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.790> 24<00:04:29.390> for<00:04:29.930> now<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.770> right<00:04:34.490> here's

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
back to 24 for now and so right here's

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.370 
back to 24 for now and so right here's
what<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> will<00:04:35.390> look<00:04:35.510> like<00:04:35.570> at<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.960> beginning

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
what it will look like at the beginning

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.740 
what it will look like at the beginning
right<00:04:36.560> here<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.670> wanted<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.330> look<00:04:38.420> like<00:04:38.480> at

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
right here so I wanted to look like at

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.440 
right here so I wanted to look like at
the<00:04:38.900> end<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:40.520> we<00:04:40.640> want<00:04:40.790> to<00:04:40.880> move<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.210> just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
the end so if we want to move it just

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.880 
the end so if we want to move it just
across<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.930> stage<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:43.640> can<00:04:43.790> do<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.120> and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
across the stage you can do that and

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.530 
across the stage you can do that and
you'll<00:04:45.890> see<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.310> green<00:04:46.610> line<00:04:46.880> I'll<00:04:47.210> get<00:04:47.390> more

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
you'll see this green line I'll get more

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.460 
you'll see this green line I'll get more
into<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.110> second<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:48.530> using<00:04:48.890> cs4<00:04:50.470> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
into that in a second if using cs4 and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.760 
into that in a second if using cs4 and
to<00:04:52.400> just<00:04:52.640> test<00:04:52.910> what<00:04:53.090> you've<00:04:53.270> done<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.650> can

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
to just test what you've done you can

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.000 
to just test what you've done you can
just<00:04:54.950> hit<00:04:55.070> enter<00:04:55.570> plate<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.810> there<00:04:57.770> we<00:04:57.890> go

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
just hit enter plate and there we go

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.180 
just hit enter plate and there we go
right<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:59.240> um<00:04:59.570> definitely<00:05:00.530> moved<00:05:00.950> across

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
right that um definitely moved across

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.180 
right that um definitely moved across
the<00:05:01.280> screen<00:05:01.550> like<00:05:01.640> we<00:05:01.970> wanted<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:03.290> I'll<00:05:03.980> play

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
the screen like we wanted and I'll play

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.390 
the screen like we wanted and I'll play
it<00:05:04.250> again<00:05:04.430> that's<00:05:05.300> one<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:06.860> we<00:05:07.220> can

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
it again that's one and so we can

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.750 
it again that's one and so we can
shorten<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:07.970> down<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.290> about<00:05:09.410> half<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.830> put

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
shorten it down to about half that put

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.080 
shorten it down to about half that put
it<00:05:10.910> 12<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:12.350> know<00:05:12.380> go<00:05:12.650> half<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:13.670> know<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:13.820> little

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
it 12 you know go half you know a little

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.500 
it 12 you know go half you know a little
faster<00:05:14.930> we<00:05:15.050> can<00:05:15.170> put<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.500> at<00:05:15.880> 70<00:05:16.880> if<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.240> want

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
faster we can put it at 70 if you want

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.640 
faster we can put it at 70 if you want
it<00:05:17.630> course<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.260> little<00:05:18.470> much<00:05:19.220> slower

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
it course it a little much slower

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.410 
it course it a little much slower
it's<00:05:21.220> definitely<00:05:21.520> something<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:22.060> play

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
it's definitely something you just play

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.790 
it's definitely something you just play
around<00:05:22.660> with<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.050> get<00:05:23.170> a<00:05:23.260> feel<00:05:23.470> for<00:05:23.500> the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
around with and get a feel for the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.150 
around with and get a feel for the
timeline<00:05:24.270> how<00:05:25.270> much<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.660> want<00:05:25.960> how<00:05:26.710> fast<00:05:26.980> you

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
timeline how much you want how fast you

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.460 
timeline how much you want how fast you
want<00:05:27.280> your<00:05:27.460> animations<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.150> be<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:29.260> we'll<00:05:29.380> go

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
want your animations to be so we'll go

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.880 
want your animations to be so we'll go
back<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.830> 24<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:31.260> if<00:05:32.260> you're<00:05:32.380> using<00:05:32.500> status

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
back to 24 and if you're using status

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.540 
back to 24 and if you're using status
for<00:05:33.190> I<00:05:33.430> want<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.330> point<00:05:34.510> out<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:35.130> new<00:05:36.130> feature

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
for I want to point out a new feature

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.680 
for I want to point out a new feature
which<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.350> definitely<00:05:38.430> definitely<00:05:39.480> so<00:05:40.480> much

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
which is definitely definitely so much

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.230 
which is definitely definitely so much
easier<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.290> use<00:05:41.320> if<00:05:42.160> you've<00:05:42.400> used<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.790> previous

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
easier to use if you've used a previous

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.940 
easier to use if you've used a previous
version<00:05:43.570> of<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.690> flash<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.740> know<00:05:44.830> I'm

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
version of the flash you know I'm

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.540 
version of the flash you know I'm
talking<00:05:45.100> about<00:05:45.370> but<00:05:45.850> if<00:05:46.510> you<00:05:46.990> haven't

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
talking about but if you haven't

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.790 
talking about but if you haven't
considered<00:05:48.550> self<00:05:49.000> lucky<00:05:49.390> this<00:05:50.200> is<00:05:50.410> just<00:05:50.650> the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
considered self lucky this is just the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.890 
considered self lucky this is just the
path<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.960> screen<00:05:53.380> lies<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> path<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.490> takes

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
path to screen lies a path that it takes

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.680 
path to screen lies a path that it takes
and<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.990> can<00:05:56.170> alter<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:56.590> path<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:58.240> if<00:05:58.510> we

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
and you can alter that path so if we

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.290 
and you can alter that path so if we
made<00:05:59.140> it<00:06:00.150> arced<00:06:01.150> like<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:02.760> it'll<00:06:03.760> arc<00:06:03.970> like

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
made it arced like that it'll arc like

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.280 
made it arced like that it'll arc like
that<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:05.230> play<00:06:05.590> through<00:06:06.540> if<00:06:07.540> we<00:06:07.780> bring<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.200> up

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
that and play through if we bring it up

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.240 
that and play through if we bring it up
here<00:06:08.800> it'll<00:06:10.260> down<00:06:12.720> so<00:06:13.720> for<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.110> side

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
here it'll down so for this side

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.940 
here it'll down so for this side
now<00:06:15.760> you<00:06:15.880> can<00:06:16.030> just<00:06:16.150> play<00:06:16.420> with<00:06:16.540> it<00:06:16.600> every<00:06:17.050> ever

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
now you can just play with it every ever
