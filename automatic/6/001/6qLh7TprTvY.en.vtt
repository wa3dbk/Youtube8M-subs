00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello sweet girls here is Max and I've tried something 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.620
 Jam as a child totally in the pants yesterday that's the only one 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.530
 Game of 20% I've found what percent in the hollow hacker 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.850
 Hackers great surfers 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.349
 although the hackers 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.009
 and I want sperm and teleported here a and thank God was ours 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.619
 Victory did not manage 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.090
 so statute unplayable 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.070
 I was so I can do it good things old coach has repeatedly inserted 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650
 I read in yours 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.580
 that he is improving her so much 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.290
 but have to honestly say if you're up to it, it still persists 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.800
 unplayable 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.660
 Cord five is equally pointless 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.490
 So those who do not want to get upset right now unfortunately better 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.860
 Fingers from NEC 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 Unfortunately, one can not say otherwise 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.500
 we are sad as small as I've said often enough like Klein Support 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 I will write again also with many other manufacturers 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.320
 Support is where you can save the easiest 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 by some miracle that there are many people now by a hotline 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 also in Bulgaria or something comes out 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.980
 So support is the thing grandma easiest way to save money 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.800
 what looks like what is synonymous directly not noticeable and that causes easy 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.020
 after sale pronounces on the money you got 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.410
 only costs Las Vegas that the first thing is saved 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.150
 it's a bit sad ending, too, who cares about it 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.820
 Games have come to life there are fortunately not all as bad as 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 Activision in which in the case, however, who now great again Elop z 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 EA is really no demanow had to have that there too 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.060
 certainly to their quirks 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 be nice to the other topic because the video goes Klose r I believe you 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.190
 more than three minutes 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.480
 In the near future, not thousands of subscribers actually have insight 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.790
 Arias won if I'm right there 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 and I find them strange that hosts of happiness for many clear 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.330
 is that I do school or something else in Ganspe 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.460
 and I have to say it honestly 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 I can not think of anything I could do and that is so briefly defended 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.229
 Hausen I should have taken the iPhone long ago when I'm there 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.530
 what wants to make bigger on the i think nothing is likely this time 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.429
 simply nothing at all 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.019
 You have to say there are already many things that are not available elsewhere 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.609
 So not at all with a minus of 2 Anja never two hours 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.779
 that's legal of the special I'm here 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.509
 El general 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.119
 and in that sense 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.149
 I think I can agree that there is no more complaint 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.089
 purely" 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.880
 a little must can only stress one of the NABU never want to give it 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.689
 that has its reasons 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.019
 I can never tell you that exactly, but some excitement 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.669
 not just the surfaces or anything else 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:43.939
 but on 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.849
 yes that's my decision when I say that's it then it's too 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.329
 accept and investment like taste 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 he just had bad luck until his fall very easy 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.539
 Unfortunately, the game is over 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.209
 what percent 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.439
 End by the still questions 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.929
 I do not know where I am either 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.799
 By the way, he should always complete cars in all parts 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.609
 Pelletier was 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.959
 So wich cars did not matter how skinny they are with no and no weapons 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.729
 there is also no such thing in this Cottier 5 6 Simone roof area 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.869
 Throwing cars in the best protection in the whole game I've heard 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 um and yes it is so synonymous on the PC so the divide so 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:28.499
 yes, those who see in the sky who goes into it, if you are lucky 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:33.079
 Play more than 1 out of 20 30 My official does not apply 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.849
 Also, really everyone can see what it looks like on the ps3 there it should 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.669
 supposedly be better 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.350
 However, he annoyed that always new tubers 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.350
 Relief for more on it again Morin can 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.539
 So we take that in addition to your experience with hackers even more so me 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.280
 currently has to be absolutely unplayable 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.559
 and it's fun too 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.349
 yes it is short and crisp over this swing 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.999
 Place Gulbis first bye bye
