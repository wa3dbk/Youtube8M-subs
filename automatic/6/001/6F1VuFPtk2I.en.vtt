00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.189
 henning smiles a bit 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.560
 right, look at this man 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.890
 original Bavarian costume looks at you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.849
 These are waiting for these shoes and this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.510
 face that 's andrew mcpherson hello 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 How are you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.100
 Servus good in it I think I have to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.540
 Do not ask for long this costume comes 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.559
 from his bavarian home city 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 landsberg not so but that was it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 but not garmisch has another 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.580
 color in which it but Bavarian 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 for me it is really you 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.750
 you like it or do it like that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 Forced election parties I love it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.559
 can wear it every day that's nice 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.089
 so I find it difficult to find it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.979
 Funny but I'm a nice one too 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.320
 I am german herzig had to ask 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.580
 if you are in Canada then look yourself 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.290
 the people a bit askance 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.760
 do not ask that in Canada I have yes 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.049
 I'm scared I know that one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 a little different but here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.130
 this is great maybe an oktoberfest 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 in Canada but not every day 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 I've already met 45 fans 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 who said that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 My favorite game as Andrew McPherson 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.130
 and I pray for a bremerhaven 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 stay now give us one more time 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.460
 signal but we have to wait 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 I think so, but I think so 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.759
 I think that's perfect for female players 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 everything oh yeah that's always up for a game 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 that's perfect platzeck that's what 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.280
 we do not know why but no 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.079
 decision do you hope that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 maybe from the dl still an offer 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.109
 comes or is it about more money or is 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.539
 it just something completely different now 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:48.420
 keep on wm and then we'll look 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.939
 But the trend is great harbor so you 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.819
 always always so he always says 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.469
 he heard that bremerhaven sees it 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.549
 good at that andrew we stay pressed 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.240
 the thumbs and hope that of course 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.240
 also thanks the endo 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.810
 i'll play alfred three 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.970
 team manager of the fishing town penguin six 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 I needed this man for years 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.000
 to commit 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.290
 it never worked out he always did 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940
 differently decided now I have him 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.100
 get it and it's a real one 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.510
 Friendship emerged that way I am 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 again matthias by link over whom does he have 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.590
 that probably said about chris straube the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.860
 stands next to me you 'll get the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.420
 leave fischtown pinguins but yes how 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.190
 is that one goes with a sad 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.630
 Hearts or do you say I have to do something 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.140
 make new and I take the positive 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.930
 with happy 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.490
 the upgrade said that was many 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.430
 years not because clearly that 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.930
 at least one year in bremerhaven 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.560
 felt before I stopped 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.430
 and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.560
 I would be happier we would 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.270
 have indeed beaten and more 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.510
 come 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.489
 that would have been earned but is 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 no wish you can say you are 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.489
 happy that means you have one 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.540
 perspective now after ice hockey what 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:13.239
 you do what you want to one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:17.709
 new club change something outside 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:23.620
 but always separate the ice 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.170
 if that works then worst 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.060
 If so, it could be that 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.220
 but unique white again ingo different it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.840
 then it may be that you are in the top league 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.340
 Would you say to yourself that you are me 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.140
 christ screw i know what i do not know 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.000
 second league and below I do 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.500
 nothing because that has something with mine 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.620
 to do honor 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.120
 but not necessarily easy on the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.900
 stage where ice hockey I'll be 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.490
 not go below the second league 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 but who are bad when you are against us 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.880
 plays and makes us clean the gates 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.860
 I mean that you have an eye 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.080
 a feeling for the hockey that has 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.100
 everyone seen from there is so much 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.410
 many also like to see you here 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.700
 bremerhaven would have seen further oh yes 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.680
 that 's nice to hear but he says 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.320
 Ice hockey business of faith 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.709
 bremerhaven is more right here 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.570
 right way with this ice hockey 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.390
 midrange with the great trainer mike 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.110
 stewart saw what he got in this first one 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.530
 has made year can only upwards 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.880
 go until we wish you all the best 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.880
 it makes you feel good for your future 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.630
 I just finished watching a reprimand 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.670
 get from the fans of fischtown 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.560
 penguin, if I have something of that 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.960
 May I want to know players 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.040
 but please stand behind and not 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.900
 just penetrate 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.670
 I'm sorry but I 'll get it 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.370
 a kind of rigid here with a microphone 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.560
 That's why I have to get in front of me 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.250
 the young wg the bremerhaven topfit 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.080
 ralf rinke and marvin miethke how much 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.080
 expensive seasonal review from marvin 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.140
 Playoffs have a bit of a page in it 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.660
 seventh game but I think it was 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.060
 nevertheless strong comeback that not 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.710
 was rewarded in the end but in the big and 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.400
 I think we are doing quite well 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.500
 beaten 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.600
 the campsite has bidding home 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.280
 said in the main round bremerhaven has 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.930
 to become the champion master yourself 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.210
 in front of the penguins in eight and I believe 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.750
 he was not wrong yes it is true 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.040
 together 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.540
 I have a lot of trainers in the league 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.890
 said that if that 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.400
 surprise team are that we 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.540
 but also have enough depth in the squad 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.590
 that we can become masters 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.930
 but in the end it did not work out 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.430
 next to her is the ralf ralf yours 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.160
 contract with the freezers wolf i believe 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.960
 another two years but that also means that 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.910
 You maybe per year 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.040
 I'm coming back 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.840
 another year in hamburg but just like it 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.820
 I will be perfect again 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.870
 only player windows of the regulation 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.400
 gives with the de 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.720
 we have to clear that up now 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.250
 among themselves the first and the second 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.700
 league and then we'll look like it 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.710
 running 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.390
 have you heard something with this dl 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.290
 for the license regulation that gave something 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.230
 will yes or no 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.800
 yes and no as chantal rumored heard 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.810
 but everything decides 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.850
 I only have to go in August 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.710
 Ravensburg for you a spießrutenlaufen 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.360
 first you have supposedly been driving 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.150
 Halo it broken then you are the one who lives 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.460
 Rohde to 3 do not like you then 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.090
 More so I was warming up too 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.350
 and look up to date like that 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.680
 got news of death and so on 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.780
 car not booed on poison though 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.190
 you have to handle it with criticism leave 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.290
 I do not let provoke further 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.600
 what the cool put away exactly 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.520
 I have 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.750
 it just does not react 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.760
 right that the ravensburg police 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.710
 negotiating with a face posters 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 I do not know but I printed 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.850
 have seen other posters where so 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.370
 Sayings on it were background to see 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.800
 we now the poster ralf's in 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.820
 the main ralf rinke 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.340
 Film actor is one 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.050
 measure yes I could make me loose 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.050
 I'm looking forward to it
