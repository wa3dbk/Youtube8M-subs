00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
12 Jags we're gonna actually start

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.110 
12 Jags we're gonna actually start
reducing<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.680> we're<00:02:26.830> only<00:02:27.010> using<00:02:27.250> 11

jugs<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:30.070> our<00:02:30.220> carbon<00:02:30.790> footprint<00:02:31.300> is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
jugs and so our carbon footprint is

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.620 
jugs and so our carbon footprint is
vastly<00:02:31.960> improved<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.970> world<00:02:34.180> our<00:02:34.390> last

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.460 
think that where I ever gonna win lose
or<00:03:21.820> draw<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:23.350> see<00:03:23.530> any<00:03:23.680> other<00:03:23.830> way<00:03:24.070> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
or draw I don't see any other way and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.750 
or draw I don't see any other way and
it's<00:03:26.470> definitely<00:03:26.860> going<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.130> be<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.310> win<00:03:27.550> lose

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
it's definitely going to be a win lose

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
it's definitely going to be a win lose
or<00:03:27.970> draw<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.720> we<00:03:29.440> score<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.310> when<00:03:30.910> maybes<00:03:31.540> win

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
