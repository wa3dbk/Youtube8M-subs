hello<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.250> short<00:00:02.820> tutorial<00:00:03.389> about<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
hello this is a short tutorial about the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.230 
hello this is a short tutorial about the
baby<00:00:04.680> Dan<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.569> flexi<00:00:06.569> fit<00:00:06.779> wood<00:00:07.940> baby<00:00:08.940> gate

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
baby Dan and flexi fit wood baby gate

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720 
baby Dan and flexi fit wood baby gate
and<00:00:09.599> I've<00:00:10.380> been<00:00:10.590> doing<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.130> hours<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and I've been doing this for hours so I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.339 
and I've been doing this for hours so I
thought<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> would<00:00:12.300> let<00:00:12.509> someone<00:00:12.840> else<00:00:13.049> have

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
thought I would let someone else have

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.400 
thought I would let someone else have
the<00:00:13.500> benefit<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> my<00:00:14.280> headache<00:00:15.199> here<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.260> go

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the benefit of my headache here we go

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.769 
the benefit of my headache here we go
I've<00:00:16.920> actually<00:00:17.100> assembled<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.090> pretty<00:00:18.600> much

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I've actually assembled it pretty much

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.370 
I've actually assembled it pretty much
fully<00:00:19.730> without<00:00:20.730> put<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> wall<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
fully without put it on the wall so the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.460 
fully without put it on the wall so the
this<00:00:22.920> part<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> hinge<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this part this is the hinge and the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.019 
this part this is the hinge and the
spring<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:25.920> inside<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.609> hinge

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.999 

yeah<00:00:30.029> that's<00:00:30.269> inside<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.779> hinge<00:00:30.990> when<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
yeah that's inside that hinge when you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.380 
yeah that's inside that hinge when you
do<00:00:32.130> these<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:34.640> these<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.670> screws

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
do these up these are these are screws

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.600 
do these up these are these are screws
and<00:00:36.570> screw<00:00:36.690> sockets<00:00:37.200> these<00:00:37.440> are<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> shorter

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and screw sockets these are the shorter

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.040 
and screw sockets these are the shorter
ones<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.079> four<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> those

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
ones you get I can get four of those

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
ones you get I can get four of those
four<00:00:43.050> sets<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.559> those<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.460> four

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
four sets of those and then you get four

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
four sets of those and then you get four
sets<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.329> ones<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.200> sort<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
sets of these ones as well these sort of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
sets of these ones as well these sort of
bracket<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.090> gate<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bracket things this gate that's the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.340 
bracket things this gate that's the
whole<00:00:49.020> gate<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.129> stretch<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.350> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
whole gate so you stretch this out it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.569 
whole gate so you stretch this out it
doesn't<00:00:52.620> break<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> middle<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.430> anything

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
doesn't break in the middle or anything

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.000 
doesn't break in the middle or anything
like<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.570> gate<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.590> but

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
like that is just like one gate and but

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 
like that is just like one gate and but
this<00:00:56.309> having<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.050> allows<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.469> stretch<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this having to allows you to stretch it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.560 
this having to allows you to stretch it
out<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> different<00:00:59.609> lengths<00:01:00.030> according<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
out to different lengths according to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.520 
out to different lengths according to
where<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.609> wide<00:01:02.910> your

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
where you are you know how wide your

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
where you are you know how wide your
you're<00:01:04.530> around<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:06.030> walls<00:01:06.600> are

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you're around you know walls are

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're around you know walls are
etcetera<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:08.520> thing<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.740> just<00:01:10.740> took<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
etcetera this thing here just took me a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.289 
etcetera this thing here just took me a
while<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> work<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.200> here

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
while to work out this little thing here

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.390 
while to work out this little thing here
this<00:01:15.299> thing<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.780> swivels<00:01:16.439> around<00:01:16.560> because

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
this thing here swivels around because

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690 
this thing here swivels around because
you<00:01:17.939> might<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.830> put<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> against<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you might want to put this against the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
you might want to put this against the
wall<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.689> gate<00:01:21.869> goes<00:01:22.170> against

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
wall that way so the gate goes against

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
wall that way so the gate goes against
the<00:01:22.590> wall<00:01:22.740> rather<00:01:22.979> than<00:01:23.130> against<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> wall

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the wall rather than against the wall

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.679 
the wall rather than against the wall
there<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.610> operate<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.180> prating

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
there and when it's operate well prating

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.179 
there and when it's operate well prating
this<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:30.210> pull<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.840> back

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
this thing here you pull that back

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
this thing here you pull that back
whether<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> lift<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> gate<00:01:33.960> up

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
whether I can lift it it's the gate up

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.010 
whether I can lift it it's the gate up
on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> bottom<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.450> thing<00:01:36.780> here

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
on the bottom it's got this thing here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.980 
on the bottom it's got this thing here
and<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:39.600> fits<00:01:40.049> into<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.600> thing<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:44.990> which

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and that fits into this thing here which

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
and that fits into this thing here which
is<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.829> plastic<00:01:47.040> doo-dah<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.780> got

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is a little plastic doo-dah and it's got

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.270 
is a little plastic doo-dah and it's got
a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.909> angle<00:01:51.350> plastic<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.590> which

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
a little the angle plastic there which

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.260 
a little the angle plastic there which
fits<00:01:53.579> into<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:56.030> like<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:58.909> okay<00:01:59.909> and<00:01:59.939> that's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
fits into it like that okay and that's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
fits into it like that okay and that's
just<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> direction<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
just to do with the direction of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
just to do with the direction of the
gate<00:02:02.159> whether<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> want<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.270> in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
gate whether you want it to just go in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
gate whether you want it to just go in
one<00:02:03.509> direction<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:04.140> two<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.710> obviously<00:02:04.979> if

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
one direction or two so obviously if

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.970 
one direction or two so obviously if
it's<00:02:05.369> two<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.420> wouldn't<00:02:06.689> use<00:02:06.869> that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
it's two then you wouldn't use that

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.810 
it's two then you wouldn't use that
and<00:02:08.070> with<00:02:08.400> this<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.760> well<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:10.740> can<00:02:10.980> choose<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and with this as well you can choose to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.020 
and with this as well you can choose to
open<00:02:12.710> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.890> choose<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.370> go<00:02:14.790> one

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
open you can choose to have it go one

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.910 
open you can choose to have it go one
way<00:02:15.180> or<00:02:15.210> another<00:02:15.380> there's<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.680> thing<00:02:16.890> in

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
way or another there's a little thing in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.270 
way or another there's a little thing in
here

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
here

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
here
let's<00:02:20.280> give<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.360> out<00:02:21.600> this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
let's give it that get this out this

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.430 
let's give it that get this out this
thing<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:23.550> thing<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:23.970> slots<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:25.020> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
thing here this thing here slots in to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.010 
thing here this thing here slots in to
there<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.850> put<00:02:27.330> get<00:02:27.570> pen<00:02:27.840> or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
there and if you just put get pen or

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.810 
there and if you just put get pen or
anything<00:02:28.290> sort<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.890> sharp<00:02:29.130> object<00:02:29.490> push<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
anything sort of sharp object push that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.610 
anything sort of sharp object push that
in<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.240> pull<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> out<00:02:30.600> again<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:31.470> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
in you can pull it out again if you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
in you can pull it out again if you
don't<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.210> can<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.390> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
don't like that so then you can have you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.540 
don't like that so then you can have you
gates<00:02:33.720> swing<00:02:33.840> both<00:02:34.140> ways<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.190> else<00:02:38.340> can

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
gates swing both ways and what else can

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.570 
gates swing both ways and what else can
I<00:02:38.580> tell<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.440> hint<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:40.830> I've

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
I tell you that's a hint there I've

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.190 
I tell you that's a hint there I've
showed<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.120> already<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:45.030> base<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.110> do

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
showed you that already the base to do

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140 
showed you that already the base to do
is<00:02:46.380> line<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.730> that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
is line up like that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
is line up like that
because<00:02:48.720> then<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.960> can't<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.380> any<00:02:49.530> other

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
because then you can't do it any other

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.010 
because then you can't do it any other
way<00:02:49.710> anyway<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.970> these<00:02:51.120> things<00:02:51.360> because<00:02:51.810> of

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
way anyway with these things because of

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.000 
way anyway with these things because of
the<00:02:52.050> way<00:02:52.200> they<00:02:52.350> are<00:02:52.380> they're<00:02:52.680> actually

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the way they are they're actually

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.820 
the way they are they're actually
exactly<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:54.720> stat<00:02:55.320> distance<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:58.710> know

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
exactly that stat distance and you know

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.330 
exactly that stat distance and you know
obviously<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.490> want<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.910> make<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.750> wider

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
obviously if you want to make it wider

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.700 
obviously if you want to make it wider
longer<00:03:02.390> then<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.960> undo<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.530> these

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
longer then you have to undo all these

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.440 
longer then you have to undo all these
four<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.610> whenever<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.090> when<00:03:06.330> you're

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
four so whenever you can when you're

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.210 
four so whenever you can when you're
doing<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.930> never<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> anything<00:03:08.010> up

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
doing this up never do anything up

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 
doing this up never do anything up
really<00:03:08.460> tight<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> beginning<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.480> leave

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
really tight in the beginning just leave

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.230 
really tight in the beginning just leave
it<00:03:10.440> sort<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.430> know<00:03:11.490> quite<00:03:11.760> loose<00:03:12.000> and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
it sort of a you know quite loose and

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.960 
it sort of a you know quite loose and
then<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.600> change<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.770> as<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.520> go<00:03:14.850> along

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
then you can change it as you go along

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.830 
then you can change it as you go along
infinitive<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.570> really

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
infinitive and so that's about it really

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
infinitive and so that's about it really
I<00:03:18.870> can't<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.800> anything<00:03:19.920> else<00:03:20.160> these

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
I can't think of anything else these

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.470 
I can't think of anything else these
things<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:22.320> tighten<00:03:23.160> how's<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:26.450> yeah<00:03:27.450> I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
things you tighten how's that yeah I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.090 
things you tighten how's that yeah I
think<00:03:27.600> that's<00:03:27.930> about<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.500> any

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
think that's about it really any

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.580 
think that's about it really any
questions<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:30.750> let<00:03:31.530> me<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.680> thank<00:03:32.520> you
