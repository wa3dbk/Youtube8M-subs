00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 before we battlefield 3 in late 2011 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.069
 we can play a few 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.830
 to overcome minor obstacles 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 first there will be the origin registration 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.790
 this will just around the launch around 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 a real political 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.960
 and not just because the players 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.199
 Forces any software 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.539
 Use the steam competitor's origin 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.000
 at first very very curious and left 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.410
 data from the pcs of the user from the for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 the functionality of the program 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 not at all significant 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 origin has the reputation of being one of the first 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 spyware gone the whole 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.510
 problematic is rocking through the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 Terms of use of origin still 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.040
 Continue on in which is a passus 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 that is allowed to the publisher 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 the data collected for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 marketing purposes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 but not long by the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 resistance of the players and the medial 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 not least because of gangster pressure 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 electronic arts forced the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 addressed passage completely closed 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 to brush 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 but who believes then with the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.860
 registration at origin it is done the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.200
 is wrong 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 a double registration is necessary to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.610
 to play battlefield 3 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.590
 at origin and in battlelog in contrast 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.600
 but this is original 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.259
 a meaningful extension of the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 battlefield experience the player search 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 works easy and comfortable 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 It is also easily possible 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 in scotts together or 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.650
 to follow a friend in a game 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.650
 but now it's time to get canned 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.930
 plöckl t3 convinces like the bet 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 Company parts with a well-made 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.430
 singleplayer campaign 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.380
 In addition, the game has a co- op mode 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.660
 in marschgepäck but the veteran knows 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.360
 all the bells and whistles on the multiplayer 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.010
 battlefield is valid and convinced here 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.010
 Battlefield 3 complete 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 well so disturb a few small things 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.860
 then miss the commander mode 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 many fans of the second part and the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 destroying possibilities of the environment 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.880
 falls in comparison to bad company 2 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 less extensive 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.290
 a few problems with the classes 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
 balance of the assault roughly combines the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.220
 strongest weapon type with the strongest 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 skills and masses 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.209
 resuscitation and healing a lot 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.240
 faster experience points than that 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.730
 other classes 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.920
 measured by the many many positive ones 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.870
 Aspects of multiplayer experience 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.730
 not quite outgrown the classes 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.450
 Balance, however, only a drop on 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.450
 the hot stone 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.840
 starting with the technical aspects 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.210
 the look in battlefield 3 makes us happy 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.460
 the frostbite engine 2 out of the shoes 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.410
 even if the lighting effects something 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.300
 turn over the top and irritating 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.300
 such a pretty multiplayer shooter 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.090
 There was never any added to it before 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.550
 a top class sound everywhere 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.030
 rumst it the weapons sounds super easy 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.030
 Top 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.090
 on this framework unfold the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.940
 typical battlefield battles with 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.220
 all sorts of hills of armor 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.800
 from helicopters and jazz all the way to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.960
 a skid steer is all there 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.060
 the variety the destructive 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.250
 possibilities of the environment and the great 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.520
 webdesign create your very own 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.410
 feeling of freedom in battlefield 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.210
 just this non-linearity in the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 games aside from the whole 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.900
 free circuits sunset ascended to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.480
 the long-term motivation 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.220
 to increase this still pushes dice 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.650
 several dlcs behind 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.270
 in sum, five each of the four 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.750
 maps and next to it also new 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.160
 Game modes and weapons included 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.320
 we can summarize the dlcs too 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.510
 acquire as battlefield premium with 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.540
 an earlier entrance and lower the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.720
 the total price is linked to the quality 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.210
 the dlcs varies however positively 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.610
 to highlight are back to karkand and 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.090
 aftermath represents the biggest disappointment 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.440
 the balancing art kilda at klosters 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.440
 on the other hand, the spirits are divorced 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.860
 the extension breaks with old ones 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.810
 Traditions vehicles are missing and the 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.049
 cards are for battlefield relationships 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.880
 how fair tiny waters set 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.460
 on fast run and gun action of all 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.460
 call of duty finally play 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.170
 the maps but really good 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.410
 Battlefield 3 was and is one 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.510
 A fantastic game that fans too 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.790
 after a playing time in three digits 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.680
 hourly area still captivates because it's new 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.010
 standards in the multiplayer experience 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.210
 has set medlock despite origins wang 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.210
 and premium model
