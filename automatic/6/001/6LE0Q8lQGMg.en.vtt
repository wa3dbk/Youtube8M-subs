00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620 
any of these get yourself a fabric
stabilizer<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:21.880> that's<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.360> lot<00:03:22.510> of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
stabilizer so that's what the lot of

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.600 
stabilizer so that's what the lot of
these<00:03:22.750> lace<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.290> treated<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:23.920> they<00:03:24.340> put<00:03:24.579> a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
these lace is treated and they put a

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.370 
these lace is treated and they put a
stabilizer<00:03:25.269> on<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.660> that's<00:03:25.810> what<00:03:25.930> makes<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.200> so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
stabilizer on it that's what makes it so

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.140 
stabilizer on it that's what makes it so
tough<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.400> notice<00:03:27.730> after<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
tough and then if you notice after you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.940 
tough and then if you notice after you
ventilator<00:03:28.600> with<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.989> wash<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.440> all<00:03:29.620> that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
ventilator with you wash it all that

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.520 
ventilator with you wash it all that
that<00:03:30.340> their<00:03:30.730> hardness<00:03:31.030> goes<00:03:31.360> away<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.350> then

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
that their hardness goes away and then

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.039 
that their hardness goes away and then
if<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.769> don't<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.280> any<00:03:34.000> fabric<00:03:34.360> stabilized

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
if you don't have any fabric stabilized

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.460 
if you don't have any fabric stabilized
you<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.350> take<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:36.070> good<00:03:36.280> um<00:03:37.290> spritz<00:03:38.290> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
you can take a really good um spritz a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.770 
you can take a really good um spritz a
really<00:03:38.829> super<00:03:39.250> strong<00:03:39.549> spritz<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.209> sprinted

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
really super strong spritz and sprinted

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.539 
really super strong spritz and sprinted
and<00:03:41.140> then<00:03:41.290> also<00:03:41.530> what<00:03:41.920> it's<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.400> is
