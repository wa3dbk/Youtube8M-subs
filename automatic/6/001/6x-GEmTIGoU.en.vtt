00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
done all right let's get back up the I'm

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.930 
done all right let's get back up the I'm
not<00:03:21.500> sure<00:03:21.680> how<00:03:21.830> long<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.130> DLC<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.700> mean

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
not sure how long this DLC is I mean

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.150 
not sure how long this DLC is I mean
it's<00:03:23.030> only<00:03:23.120> one<00:03:23.450> zone<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.080> assume<00:03:24.440> anyway<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
it's only one zone I assume anyway the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.380 
it's only one zone I assume anyway the
legend<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.519> outer<00:03:25.700> zone<00:03:25.970> when<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.150> think

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
legend is outer zone when you think

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.759 
legend is outer zone when you think
about<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:26.810> exactly<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.440> long<00:03:27.590> either

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
about it's not exactly that long either

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.670 
about it's not exactly that long either
