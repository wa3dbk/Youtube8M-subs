00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160

chance for Maria because at some point

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
chance for Maria because at some point
we<00:00:34.499> would<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:34.949> that<00:00:35.010> she<00:00:35.129> is<00:00:35.429> gonna<00:00:35.640> beat

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
we would think that she is gonna beat

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
we would think that she is gonna beat
Serena<00:00:36.239> Williams<00:00:36.600> again<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
Serena Williams again and I think that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.739 
Serena Williams again and I think that
serena<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.609> been<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.149> bit<00:00:39.480> vulnerable

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
serena has been a little bit vulnerable

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.439 
serena has been a little bit vulnerable
in<00:00:40.649> some<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.159> matches<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.909> and

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
in some of the matches here and and

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.930 
in some of the matches here and and
Maria<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.320> such<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> fierce<00:00:44.129> competitor<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Maria is such a fierce competitor and I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
Maria is such a fierce competitor and I
really<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.749> she<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> able<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.499> put<00:00:46.710> all

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
really think that she is able to put all

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
really think that she is able to put all
those<00:00:47.190> matches<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.420> her<00:00:48.510> mind<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:48.960> go

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
those matches out of her mind and go

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.919 
those matches out of her mind and go
back<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.859> when<00:00:50.129> she<00:00:50.429> beat<00:00:50.670> her<00:00:50.699> in<00:00:50.999> 2004<00:00:51.780> and

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
this semi-final so Matt is there any

quick fix that she can try and achieve

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
quick fix that she can try and achieve
before<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.070> matchup<00:01:29.340> um<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.270> mean<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.930> really

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
before this matchup um I mean not really

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
before this matchup um I mean not really
I<00:01:31.469> guess<00:01:32.070> she<00:01:32.310> could<00:01:32.520> take<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.420> off

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I guess she could take a little bit off

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
I guess she could take a little bit off
her<00:01:33.719> first<00:01:34.020> server<00:01:34.289> make<00:01:34.560> sure<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.009> goes<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
her first server make sure that goes in

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
her first server make sure that goes in
but<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> same<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.270> she<00:01:36.479> does<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> lot

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
but at the same time she does get a lot

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.779 
but at the same time she does get a lot
of<00:01:37.079> free<00:01:37.350> points<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.979> first<00:01:38.189> sir<00:01:38.399> so<00:01:38.609> I

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
of free points on the first sir so I

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.240 
of free points on the first sir so I
really<00:01:39.359> feel<00:01:39.539> like<00:01:39.570> she<00:01:39.899> lives<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.979> dies<00:01:41.189> by

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
really feel like she lives and dies by

has<00:02:19.400> had<00:02:19.610> 10<00:02:20.000> less<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.110> Sharapova's<00:02:21.740> forehand

in<00:02:25.569> 2004<00:02:26.569> but<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.260> good<00:02:27.560> enough<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.950> deal

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
in 2004 but is it good enough to deal

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.740 
in 2004 but is it good enough to deal
with<00:02:28.250> an<00:02:28.340> improved<00:02:28.670> Serena<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.510> time<00:02:29.720> around

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
with an improved Serena this time around

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
with an improved Serena this time around
well<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.470> think<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.950> Maria<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.490> different

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
well I think for Maria it's different

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.600 
well I think for Maria it's different
because<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.300> 2004<00:02:33.080> she<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.440> unpolished<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.490> I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
because in 2004 she was unpolished and I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.520 
because in 2004 she was unpolished and I
think<00:02:34.790> she<00:02:34.910> went<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.360> more<00:02:35.570> winners<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
think she went for more winners on the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.840 
think she went for more winners on the
forehand<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.010> she<00:02:37.220> must<00:02:37.340> fully<00:02:37.550> had<00:02:37.700> more

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
forehand and she must fully had more

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.600 
forehand and she must fully had more
unforced<00:02:38.270> errors<00:02:38.600> as<00:02:38.750> well<00:02:38.900> today<00:02:39.590> she<00:02:40.100> keeps

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
unforced errors as well today she keeps

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.430 
unforced errors as well today she keeps
it<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:40.940> place<00:02:40.970> as<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.780> more<00:02:41.900> topspin<00:02:42.350> on

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
it in place as a little more topspin on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.050 
it in place as a little more topspin on
it<00:02:42.590> there<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.100> two<00:02:43.190> hits<00:02:43.340> less<00:02:43.580> winners<00:02:43.910> but

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
it there for two hits less winners but

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.360 
it there for two hits less winners but
on<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.330> other<00:02:44.450> hand<00:02:44.570> Serena<00:02:45.440> Williams<00:02:45.980> were

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
on the other hand Serena Williams were

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.670 
on the other hand Serena Williams were
missing<00:02:46.820> way<00:02:47.090> more<00:02:47.480> back<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.170> now<00:02:48.620> she

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
missing way more back then and now she

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.949 
missing way more back then and now she
as<00:02:49.190> well<00:02:49.459> has<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> little<00:02:49.880> bit<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.269> shape<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.870> her

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
as well has a little bit of shape on her

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.960 
as well has a little bit of shape on her
forehead<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:52.459> she<00:02:52.550> takes<00:02:52.760> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
forehead and I think she takes it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.509 
forehead and I think she takes it
earlier<00:02:53.660> more<00:02:54.200> inside<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> baseline<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.190> she

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
earlier more inside a baseline and she

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.070 
earlier more inside a baseline and she
goes<00:02:55.700> for<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.000> more<00:02:56.209> while<00:02:56.600> some<00:02:56.780> good<00:02:56.930> news

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
goes for it more while some good news

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.630 
goes for it more while some good news

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
from maria is that she is performing

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.759

percent again tournament average is
sixty-five<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.390> they<00:03:23.480> are<00:03:23.600> both<00:03:23.750> above

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019

Maria's<00:03:28.130> success<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:28.730> think<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.299> these<00:03:29.570> days

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
Maria's success I think it is these days

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.660 
Maria's success I think it is these days
again<00:03:30.380> she<00:03:30.620> tries<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.860> keep<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.310> ball<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.519> play

again she tries to keep the ball in play
I<00:03:32.209> think<00:03:32.450> in<00:03:32.600> many<00:03:32.720> ways<00:03:32.870> she's<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.230> much<00:03:33.530> better

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
I think in many ways she's a much better

I think in many ways she's a much better

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650

if Maria can extend the rallies she has
a<00:03:38.930> good<00:03:39.200> chance<00:03:39.380> well<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.130> should<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.310> a
