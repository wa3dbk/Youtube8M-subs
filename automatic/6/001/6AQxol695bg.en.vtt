00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
lot from the photo tripod design so you
actually<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.530> three<00:01:49.799> independent<00:01:50.189> leg

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
actually have your three independent leg

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually have your three independent leg
positions<00:01:51.149> each<00:01:51.840> leg<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.439> set

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
positions each leg can be set

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
positions each leg can be set
independently<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> other<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.329> if

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
independently of the other two so if

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
independently of the other two so if
you're<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.930> stairs<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.860> any<00:01:56.430> kind<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you're doing like stairs or any kind of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.590 
you're doing like stairs or any kind of
rocky<00:01:56.909> terrain

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
rocky terrain

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.730 
rocky terrain
you<00:01:57.840> don't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> look<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> flat

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
you don't have to look for a flat

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.499 
you don't have to look for a flat
surface<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.400> mount<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.670> anywhere<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
surface you can mount this anywhere and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.390 
surface you can mount this anywhere and
you<00:02:00.630> will<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.840> spiked<00:02:01.170> feet<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.100> carrying

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
you will get spiked feet and a carrying

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640 
you will get spiked feet and a carrying
case<00:02:02.549> along<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.229> buy<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.409> head

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
case along with it do you buy the head

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.870 
case along with it do you buy the head
and<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> leg<00:02:05.040> separately

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and the leg separately

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.370 
and the leg separately
is<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> bundle<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> buy<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> head

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
is it a bundle you can buy the head

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.779 
is it a bundle you can buy the head
separately<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.190> need<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> flat

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
separately if you just need that flat

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
separately if you just need that flat
base<00:02:08.970> head<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.350> aluminum

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
base head but we do have the aluminum

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.190 
base head but we do have the aluminum
kit<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.850> aluminum<00:02:12.030> kit<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.630> right<00:02:13.020> now

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
kit so the aluminum kit is right now

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.460 
kit so the aluminum kit is right now
it's<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.470> promo<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.310> was<00:02:14.459> 395<00:02:15.260> carbon<00:02:16.260> fiber

this<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.360> arrow<00:02:39.360> tripod<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.250> reverse

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
this is the arrow tripod it's a reverse

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.759 
this is the arrow tripod it's a reverse
folding<00:02:42.090> video<00:02:42.390> tripod<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.410> lot<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> guys

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
something I can bring on the plane I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.530 
something I can bring on the plane I
don't<00:02:46.440> want<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.830> check<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.069> tripod

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
don't want to check my tripod

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
don't want to check my tripod
documentary<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:50.130> need<00:02:50.430> something<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
documentary work and I need something I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.970 
documentary work and I need something I
can<00:02:50.940> put<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> rolling<00:02:51.569> case<00:02:51.830> actually<00:02:52.830> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
can put in a rolling case actually this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
can put in a rolling case actually this
will<00:02:53.100> fit<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.519> roadie<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> larger

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
will fit in a roadie we have a larger

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.870 
will fit in a roadie we have a larger
size<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.530> detach<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.190> head<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.670> put<00:02:56.790> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
size that detach the head you can put it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.180 
size that detach the head you can put it
in<00:02:56.970> any<00:02:57.090> rolling<00:02:57.390> case<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:58.739> way<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.069> can

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
in any rolling case this way you can

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.750 
in any rolling case this way you can
just<00:02:59.310> put<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> overhead<00:03:01.579> let's<00:03:02.579> see

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
just put it in the overhead let's see

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.310 
just put it in the overhead let's see
let's<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.299> lets<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.959> its<00:03:04.079> but<00:03:04.200> yeah

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
let's see it lets see it do its but yeah

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 
let's see it lets see it do its but yeah
there<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.650> these<00:03:04.799> reverse<00:03:05.100> folding<00:03:05.459> legs<00:03:05.610> here

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
there so these reverse folding legs here

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.160 
there so these reverse folding legs here
it's<00:03:06.450> real<00:03:06.630> easy<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:07.049> deploy

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
it's real easy to deploy

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
it's real easy to deploy
you<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.260> your<00:03:10.380> flip<00:03:10.590> flops<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.250> can

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you have your flip flops you can

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.250 
you have your flip flops you can
actually<00:03:12.480> adjust<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.810> height<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.109> center

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
actually adjust the height of the center

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.349 
actually adjust the height of the center
column<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.829> now<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.310> way<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.700> works<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.180> we

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
column and now the way this works is we

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.720 
column and now the way this works is we
actually<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> fixed<00:03:16.350> half<00:03:16.739> leveling<00:03:17.549> ball

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
actually have a fixed half leveling ball

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
actually have a fixed half leveling ball
in<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> center<00:03:18.359> column<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.140> don't<00:03:19.290> have

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
in the center column so you don't have

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.690 
in the center column so you don't have
to<00:03:19.500> worry<00:03:19.799> about<00:03:19.859> leveling<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
to worry about leveling this with the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.550 
to worry about leveling this with the
legs<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.900> level<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.230> right<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
legs you can level it right here and the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.380 
legs you can level it right here and the
