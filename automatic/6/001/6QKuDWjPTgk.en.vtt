00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.470
 to make an arrangement so one 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 nonsense 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.580

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
 every button is often ready 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.450
 so must the others , however 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.320
 That's why I go 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.320

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.730

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.610
 Entrance doors and the portal opens 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.320

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.320
 you get to the respective ships 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.250
 built a kind of engine 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.800
 and then mine is on the ships 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.250
 for some reason for that 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250
 labeling 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.090
 Something weirdly likes something 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.380
