00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
so these techniques the I'm about to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.100 
so these techniques the I'm about to
discuss<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.320> used<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.799> any<00:00:13.980> hair<00:00:14.280> type

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
this can be cream lotion or milk but you

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.310 
this can be cream lotion or milk but you
want<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.730> make<00:00:27.850> sure<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.270> it's<00:00:28.540> water-based

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
and full of millions and millions can be

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.400 
and full of millions and millions can be
things<00:00:32.410> like<00:00:32.790> coconut<00:00:33.790> oil<00:00:34.180> or<00:00:34.420> olive<00:00:34.450> oil<00:00:34.960> and

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
want now guys I want to be honest I

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.970 
want now guys I want to be honest I
really<00:03:03.890> don't<00:03:04.459> understand<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.329> technique

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
really don't understand this technique

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.119 
really don't understand this technique
because<00:03:06.980> oil<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.109> oil<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.650> water<00:03:09.829> don't

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
because oil we know oil and water don't

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.539 
because oil we know oil and water don't
mix<00:03:10.250> even<00:03:11.000> though<00:03:11.269> oil<00:03:11.659> is<00:03:12.190> permeable<00:03:13.190> meaning

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
mix even though oil is permeable meaning

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.069 
mix even though oil is permeable meaning
that<00:03:13.700> water<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.209> pass<00:03:14.390> through<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
that water can pass through it

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.869 
that water can pass through it
I<00:03:15.109> don't<00:03:15.530> know<00:03:15.650> how<00:03:15.859> much<00:03:16.040> water<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.609> going<00:03:16.670> to

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
I don't know how much water is going to

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.660 
I don't know how much water is going to
pass<00:03:17.120> from<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.780> cream<00:03:18.019> based<00:03:18.319> moisturizer

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
pass from the cream based moisturizer

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.640 
pass from the cream based moisturizer
through<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.849> oil<00:03:20.090> before<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.720> dries<00:03:21.079> out<00:03:21.349> and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
through the oil before it dries out and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.839 
through the oil before it dries out and
so<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:21.799> don't<00:03:21.950> think<00:03:22.159> you're<00:03:22.400> going<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:22.609> get<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
so I don't think you're going to get the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.149 
so I don't think you're going to get the
maximum<00:03:23.359> benefits<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> cream<00:03:24.859> based

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
maximum benefits from the cream based

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.729 
maximum benefits from the cream based
moisturizer<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.750> variation<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
moisturizer and so a variation of the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.979 
moisturizer and so a variation of the
loc<00:03:27.919> method<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.669> lco<00:03:29.090> method<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.870> you're

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
loc method is the lco method and you're

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.309 
loc method is the lco method and you're
pretty<00:03:30.200> much<00:03:30.319> with<00:03:30.950> switching<00:03:31.489> how<00:03:31.669> you<00:03:31.730> apply

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
pretty much with switching how you apply

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.620 
pretty much with switching how you apply
your<00:03:33.319> cream<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.220> oil<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.819> so<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.120> apply<00:03:35.450> your

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
your cream and oil and so you apply your

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.170 
your cream and oil and so you apply your
liquid<00:03:36.139> leave<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:37.099> liquid<00:03:37.340> moisturizer

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
liquid leave in your liquid moisturizer

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.479 
liquid leave in your liquid moisturizer
on<00:03:38.329> your<00:03:38.480> leave-in<00:03:38.959> then<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.709> apply<00:03:40.160> your

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
on your leave-in then you apply your

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.520 
on your leave-in then you apply your
cream<00:03:40.700> based<00:03:41.090> moisturizer<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:42.230> then<00:03:42.379> you

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
cream based moisturizer and then you

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.890 
cream based moisturizer and then you
apply<00:03:42.799> your<00:03:42.980> oil<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.430> fill<00:03:43.639> it<00:03:43.790> all<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.480> so

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
apply your oil to fill it all in and so

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.289 
apply your oil to fill it all in and so
you're<00:03:45.109> getting<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.620> thin<00:03:45.919> layer<00:03:46.129> of

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
you're getting a thin layer of

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.210 
you're getting a thin layer of
moisturizer<00:03:47.299> which<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.109> readily<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:49.069> will

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
moisturizer which is readily that will

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.520 
moisturizer which is readily that will
readily<00:03:49.549> absorb<00:03:50.030> into<00:03:50.239> your<00:03:50.720> hair<00:03:50.930> strands<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
readily absorb into your hair strands a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.349 
readily absorb into your hair strands a
thicker<00:03:52.069> layer<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.549> moisturizer<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.269> then

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
thicker layer of moisturizer and then

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.780 
thicker layer of moisturizer and then
you<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:54.230> sell<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.500> all<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:55.579> that

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
you have to sell it all in and so that

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.300 
you have to sell it all in and so that
makes<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.120> little<00:03:56.269> bit<00:03:56.480> more<00:03:56.690> sense<00:03:57.379> to<00:03:57.530> me<00:03:57.799> then

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
makes a little bit more sense to me then

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.099 
makes a little bit more sense to me then
the<00:03:58.489> loc<00:03:58.669> method<00:03:58.699> does<00:03:59.239> now<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.870> last

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
the loc method does now the last

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.990 
the loc method does now the last
technique<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.799> little<00:04:00.949> bit<00:04:01.310> crazy<00:04:01.519> hence

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
technique is a little bit crazy hence

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.449 
technique is a little bit crazy hence
the<00:04:02.180> name<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.569> lowepro<00:04:03.019> method<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:04.099> the

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
the name the lowepro method and it's the

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.939 
the name the lowepro method and it's the
loc<00:04:04.669> method<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.930> add<00:04:06.169> another<00:04:06.590> layer<00:04:06.919> of

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
loc method and you add another layer of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.729 
loc method and you add another layer of
oil<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.699> top<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.449> so<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:09.079> two<00:04:09.379> layers

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
oil on top of it so you have two layers

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.490 
oil on top of it so you have two layers
of<00:04:09.949> moisturizer<00:04:10.730> or<00:04:11.389> two<00:04:11.599> layers<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.989> moisture

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
of moisturizer or two layers of moisture

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.390 
of moisturizer or two layers of moisture
and<00:04:12.680> two<00:04:13.010> layers<00:04:13.280> um<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:15.019> act<00:04:15.230> as<00:04:15.410> Vasili

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and two layers um to act as Vasili

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.629 
and two layers um to act as Vasili
and<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.389> really<00:04:18.019> don't<00:04:18.440> suggest<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:19.370> you

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
and so I really don't suggest that you

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.780 
and so I really don't suggest that you
do<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.479> lock<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.139> LCL<00:04:21.650> method<00:04:22.010> or<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.400> local

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
do the lock the LCL method or the local

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.150 
do the lock the LCL method or the local
method<00:04:23.150> no<00:04:23.840> more<00:04:24.080> than<00:04:24.229> one<00:04:24.410> or<00:04:24.530> two<00:04:24.560> times<00:04:24.889> a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
method no more than one or two times a

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.820 
method no more than one or two times a
week<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.639> prevent<00:04:25.970> product<00:04:26.630> build-up<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.620> so

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
week to prevent product build-up and so

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.040 
week to prevent product build-up and so
that<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.400> my<00:04:28.610> take<00:04:28.910> on<00:04:28.970> how<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.479> effectively

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
that is my take on how to effectively

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.629 
that is my take on how to effectively
moisturize<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:30.889> hair<00:04:31.010> throughout<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> week
