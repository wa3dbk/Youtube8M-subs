Japanese sets where they've been
revealed<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.030> far<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:39.989> if

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
revealed for so far so I don't know if

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
revealed for so far so I don't know if
that's<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.829> new<00:00:40.920> cards<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.460> Japan<00:00:41.760> as

that's all the new cards for Japan as

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.639 
that's all the new cards for Japan as
well<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.450> assume<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.320> gonna<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
well I assume you know it's gonna be the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.740 
well I assume you know it's gonna be the
same<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:44.940> Japan<00:00:45.120> diseases<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.629> us

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
same for you know Japan diseases for us

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
same for you know Japan diseases for us
I<00:00:45.960> assume<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.500> both<00:00:46.680> sets<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.100> be

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I assume you know both sets will be

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
I assume you know both sets will be
exactly<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> same<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.450> yeah<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> guess<00:00:49.110> there

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
exactly the same but yeah I guess there

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
exactly the same but yeah I guess there
could<00:00:49.440> possibly<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.980> some<00:00:50.280> more<00:00:50.430> card<00:00:50.700> short

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
could possibly be some more card short

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.310 
could possibly be some more card short
pants<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.420> thought<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> say

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
pants so I thought I should kind of say

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830 
pants so I thought I should kind of say
that<00:00:52.559> real<00:00:52.829> quick<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> TCG<00:00:54.480> version

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that real quick but the TCG version

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
that real quick but the TCG version
whatever<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.410> heard<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> did

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
whatever we heard more about it it did

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
whatever we heard more about it it did
say<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.300> were<00:00:57.390> only<00:00:57.510> five<00:00:58.050> new<00:00:58.230> cards<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
say there were only five new cards so it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
say there were only five new cards so it
makes<00:00:59.879> sense<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
makes sense so the first one we have is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.299 
makes sense so the first one we have is
a<00:01:02.250> drag<00:01:03.090> ido<00:01:03.359> i<00:01:03.600> guess<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> hey<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.040> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
a drag ido i guess is hey it's kind of a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
a drag ido i guess is hey it's kind of a
weird<00:01:05.339> card<00:01:05.790> anyway<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> dart<00:01:07.140> fiend

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
weird card anyway it is a dart fiend

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.760 
weird card anyway it is a dart fiend

have<00:03:22.950> monster<00:03:23.370> effects<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:24.030> other<00:03:24.600> than<00:03:24.780> that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
have monster effects but other than that

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110 
have monster effects but other than that
it<00:03:25.260> stops<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.859> lot<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> stuff<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.639> this<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:26.940> kind

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it stops a lot of stuff so this is kind

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.190 
it stops a lot of stuff so this is kind
of<00:03:27.150> interesting<00:03:27.299> car<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

of interesting car this is one of the
cards<00:03:28.470> I'm<00:03:28.590> wondering<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.250> might<00:03:29.280> end<00:03:29.430> up

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579

because like I said it can really set up

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.240 
because like I said it can really set up
a<00:03:32.940> lot<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.239> OT<00:03:33.480> Cade's<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.139> stuff<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.069> know

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
many people going to use this I think

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.599 
many people going to use this I think
it's<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> thing<00:03:52.829> could<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.099> really<00:03:53.489> useful

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
it's a thing could be really useful

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.729 
it's a thing could be really useful
though<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.239> lot<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.419> different<00:03:54.630> X<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.590> the

last coin we have talked about is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.990 
last coin we have talked about is
multiple<00:03:57.900> destruction<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:58.919> normal<00:03:59.430> trap

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
multiple destruction it is a normal trap

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000 
multiple destruction it is a normal trap
card<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.540> its<00:04:00.720> effect<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.139> if<00:04:01.709> both<00:04:01.859> players

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
basically to wait to get rid of cards

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.110 
basically to wait to get rid of cards
out<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:17.010> your<00:04:17.099> hand<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.489> then<00:04:17.579> draw<00:04:17.849> more

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
out of your hand and then draw more

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.539 
out of your hand and then draw more
cards<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.919> guess<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.130> gain<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> few<00:04:20.430> extra

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
cards I guess you can gain a few extra

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.069 
cards I guess you can gain a few extra
cards<00:04:20.880> too<00:04:21.000> because<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.269> says<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.690> had<00:04:21.810> three

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
cards too because it says it had three

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.360 
cards too because it says it had three
or<00:04:22.229> more<00:04:22.409> cards<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.830> their<00:04:22.919> hand<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.219> if<00:04:23.280> you

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
or more cards in their hand so if you

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.980 
or more cards in their hand so if you
only<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.610> like<00:04:23.760> three<00:04:24.150> then<00:04:24.659> you<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.900> do

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
only have like three then you can do

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.990 
only have like three then you can do
that<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.260> get<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.500> five

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
that and get a five

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.020 
that and get a five
cards<00:04:26.270> interesting<00:04:27.220> card<00:04:28.220> i'm<00:04:28.370> wondering<00:04:28.790> on

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
cards interesting card i'm wondering on

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.790 
cards interesting card i'm wondering on
what<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:29.810> could<00:04:29.930> really<00:04:30.080> work<00:04:30.170> with<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.620> don't

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
what this could really work with I don't

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.760 
what this could really work with I don't
have<00:04:30.980> any<00:04:31.130> ideas<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.090> top<00:04:32.240> my<00:04:32.360> head<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:33.170> it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
have any ideas up top my head but it

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.410 
have any ideas up top my head but it
seems<00:04:34.160> pretty<00:04:34.430> interesting<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.090> mean<00:04:35.120> being

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
seems pretty interesting I mean being

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.080 
seems pretty interesting I mean being
able<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.750> get<00:04:36.410> five<00:04:36.620> cards<00:04:37.010> again<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.520> then

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
able to get five cards again and then

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.240 
able to get five cards again and then
you<00:04:38.480> lose<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.930> guess<00:04:39.140> 300<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.620> points<00:04:39.920> though<00:04:40.040> for

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
you lose I guess 300 I points though for

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.040 
you lose I guess 300 I points though for
each<00:04:40.310> return<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.030> decks<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.570> I'm

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
each return to the decks so I'm

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.260 
each return to the decks so I'm
wondering<00:04:42.580> what<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.730> could<00:04:43.970> really<00:04:44.150> work

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
wondering what this could really work

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.790 
wondering what this could really work
with<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.930> don't<00:04:45.080> really<00:04:45.170> like<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.560> said<00:04:45.680> I'm

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
with I don't really like I said I'm

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.140 
with I don't really like I said I'm
really<00:04:45.890> having<00:04:46.070> ideas<00:04:46.220> top<00:04:46.490> my<00:04:46.640> head<00:04:46.670> but<00:04:47.000> I'm

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
really having ideas top my head but I'm

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.000 
really having ideas top my head but I'm
kind<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.600> hoping<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.170> will<00:04:48.350> be<00:04:48.860> pretty

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
kind of hoping that this will be pretty

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.040 
kind of hoping that this will be pretty
usable<00:04:49.310> too<00:04:49.670> cuz<00:04:49.910> I'm<00:04:50.000> as<00:04:50.360> always<00:04:50.690> hoping<00:04:50.990> that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
usable too cuz I'm as always hoping that

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.600 
usable too cuz I'm as always hoping that
any<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> newer<00:04:51.920> cards<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.310> come<00:04:52.430> out<00:04:52.490> with

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
any of the newer cards to come out with

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.540 
any of the newer cards to come out with
our<00:04:52.670> worth<00:04:53.180> printing<00:04:53.600> obviously<00:04:54.440> but<00:04:55.070> yeah<00:04:55.520> I

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
our worth printing obviously but yeah I

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.740 
our worth printing obviously but yeah I
don't<00:04:55.760> remember<00:04:55.850> who<00:04:56.030> use<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.300> either<00:04:56.480> I

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
don't remember who use this either I

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.900 
don't remember who use this either I
mean<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.140> guess<00:04:57.560> one<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.950> characters<00:04:58.730> use

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
mean I guess one of the characters use

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.340 
mean I guess one of the characters use
this<00:04:59.060> too<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.419> if<00:04:59.480> anyone<00:04:59.750> remembers<00:04:59.930> course

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
pack I said I guess this will be 40 g

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.030 
pack I said I guess this will be 40 g
and<00:05:07.580> TCG<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.090> guess<00:05:08.419> we'll<00:05:08.600> get<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.930> same<00:05:09.110> cards

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
and TCG I guess we'll get the same cards

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.350 
and TCG I guess we'll get the same cards
on<00:05:10.190> there<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:10.700> what<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.060> guys<00:05:11.120> think<00:05:11.240> about

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
on there but what you guys think about

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.640 
on there but what you guys think about
these<00:05:11.510> cards<00:05:11.810> do<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:11.930> have<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> favorite<00:05:12.560> of

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
these cards do you have a favorite of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.530 
these cards do you have a favorite of
all<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.830> them<00:05:12.980> for<00:05:13.550> me<00:05:13.640> I<00:05:13.669> guess<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.120> has<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.300> be

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
all of them for me I guess it has to be

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.150 
all of them for me I guess it has to be
the<00:05:14.810> new<00:05:14.930> winged<00:05:15.110> dragon<00:05:15.440> overall<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
the new winged dragon overall the the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.190 
the new winged dragon overall the the
sphere<00:05:16.370> mode<00:05:16.669> but<00:05:17.270> other<00:05:17.660> than<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:18.140> really

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
sphere mode but other than that I really

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.670 
sphere mode but other than that I really
like<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.810> anti-magic<00:05:20.810> arrows<00:05:21.140> I<00:05:21.500> think

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
like the the anti-magic arrows I think

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.050 
like the the anti-magic arrows I think
that's<00:05:21.830> gonna<00:05:22.010> be<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.190> really<00:05:22.310> useful<00:05:22.400> card<00:05:22.850> and

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
that's gonna be a really useful card and

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.360 
that's gonna be a really useful card and
I<00:05:23.510> like<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.290> let's<00:05:24.950> do<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.100> right<00:05:25.160> here<00:05:25.250> I

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
I like this let's do it right here I

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.830 
I like this let's do it right here I
think<00:05:25.580> he's<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.700> really<00:05:26.240> cool<00:05:26.270> effect<00:05:26.450> to

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
think he's a really cool effect to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.990 
think he's a really cool effect to
Corregidor<00:05:27.560> like<00:05:28.070> I<00:05:28.160> said<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.400> don't<00:05:28.790> really
