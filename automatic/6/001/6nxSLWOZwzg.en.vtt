harmony<00:00:43.680> year<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.789> people<00:00:45.120> won't

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
harmony year is that most people won't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
harmony year is that most people won't
really<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.840> too<00:00:46.110> many<00:00:46.289> coins<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.039> that

really have too many coins and that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
really have too many coins and that
means<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.879> won't<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.570> squads

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
means they won't have like two squads

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690 
means they won't have like two squads
because<00:00:49.170> normally<00:00:49.590> most<00:00:50.070> people<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.520> like

because normally most people have like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520 
because normally most people have like
two<00:00:50.879> squads<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.660> fitness<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.379> for

two squads one for fitness and one for
playing<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
playing but because that we're at the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
won't have too many coins because they

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
won't have too many coins because they
won't<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.899> been<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> web<00:00:58.530> app<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
won't have been on the web app so you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
won't have been on the web app so you
know<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> perfect<00:01:01.079> opportunity

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
know you know it's a perfect opportunity

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
know you know it's a perfect opportunity
because<00:01:01.770> they'll<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.039> forced<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.609> buy<00:01:02.760> score

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
because they'll be forced to buy score

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
because they'll be forced to buy score
fitness<00:01:03.510> cards<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.290> put<00:01:04.470> fitness<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.070> their

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
fitness cards to put fitness on their

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
fitness cards to put fitness on their
team<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.390> why<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> price<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> squad

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
team so that's why the price of squad

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.750 
team so that's why the price of squad
fitness<00:01:07.619> card<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> rise<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> the

how long it will take I think could be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
how long it will take I think could be
pretty<00:01:49.020> instant<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.799> we'll<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pretty instant but we'll just have to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
pretty instant but we'll just have to
see<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.700> p15<00:01:51.329> works<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.750> year<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.439> it

see how p15 works this year because it
can<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.850> last<00:01:54.060> year<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
can be a lot different to last year so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
can be a lot different to last year so
we'll<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.110> goes<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.979> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that this time web app I mean most

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670
