about it and we'll see where it goes it

about it and we'll see where it goes it
is<00:02:27.709> part<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> reason<00:02:28.430> why<00:02:28.610> he<00:02:28.730> gets<00:02:28.910> an

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
is part of the reason why he gets an

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.699 
is part of the reason why he gets an
opportunity<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.840> he's<00:02:30.140> been<00:02:30.349> here<00:02:30.680> he's

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
opportunity because he's been here he's

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.640 
opportunity because he's been here he's
been<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> part<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.819> yeah<00:02:32.360> yeah<00:02:32.780> he<00:02:33.110> can

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
been a part of this yeah yeah he can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.630 
been a part of this yeah yeah he can
always<00:02:33.769> played<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.190> position<00:02:34.280> before

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
always played the position before

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.970 
always played the position before
although<00:02:34.970> not<00:02:35.239> much<00:02:35.420> here<00:02:35.750> he<00:02:36.350> understands

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
although not much here he understands

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.360 
although not much here he understands
our<00:02:37.069> concept<00:02:37.610> i<00:02:38.260> think<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.470> when<00:02:40.190> we're

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
our concept i think is when we're

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.100 
our concept i think is when we're
teaching<00:02:40.580> our<00:02:40.880> team<00:02:41.120> concept<00:02:41.660> whether<00:02:41.930> you're

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
teaching our team concept whether you're

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.140 
teaching our team concept whether you're
a<00:02:42.140> defenseman<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.709> forward<00:02:43.190> you're<00:02:43.790> still

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
a defenseman a forward you're still

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.650 
a defenseman a forward you're still
learning<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.049> other<00:02:45.170> parts<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.660> we

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
learning the other parts of it and we

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.170 
learning the other parts of it and we
like<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.260> he's<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.120> he's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
like that you know he's you know he's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.729 
like that you know he's you know he's
done<00:02:53.480> some<00:02:53.660> good<00:02:53.780> things<00:02:53.840> it's<00:02:54.200> been<00:02:54.350> rfm

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
done some good things it's been rfm

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.910 
done some good things it's been rfm
sitting<00:02:55.040> out<00:02:55.160> here<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.580> think<00:02:56.239> Emmy<00:02:56.450> has<00:02:57.319> been

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
sitting out here I think Emmy has been

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.490 
sitting out here I think Emmy has been
more<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.340> physical<00:02:58.549> player<00:02:59.510> defensively<00:03:00.080> so

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
more of a physical player defensively so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.800 
more of a physical player defensively so
he<00:03:00.769> lost<00:03:01.010> his<00:03:01.250> spot<00:03:01.459> there<00:03:01.790> but<00:03:02.480> he's<00:03:02.599> played

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
he lost his spot there but he's played

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.400 
he lost his spot there but he's played
this<00:03:02.959> position<00:03:03.440> for<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.600> plate<00:03:05.840> I'm<00:03:06.049> a<00:03:06.200> bounce

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
this position for the plate I'm a bounce

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.870 
this position for the plate I'm a bounce
people<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:06.980> out<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.220> position<00:03:07.459> also

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
people in and out of that position also

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.569 
people in and out of that position also
it<00:03:08.359> also<00:03:08.630> gives<00:03:08.959> me<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.140> little<00:03:09.230> flexibility<00:03:09.890> as

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
it also gives me a little flexibility as

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.819 
it also gives me a little flexibility as
far<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:11.030> having<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.450> seventh<00:03:12.019> be<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.350> there<00:03:12.530> but

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
far as having a seventh be in there but

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.590 
far as having a seventh be in there but
not<00:03:12.980> really<00:03:13.190> playing<00:03:13.519> D<00:03:13.820> depends<00:03:14.359> on<00:03:14.480> what

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
not really playing D depends on what

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.750 
not really playing D depends on what
goes<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:14.870> with<00:03:15.019> some<00:03:15.140> other<00:03:15.230> guys<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:16.730> is

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
goes on with some other guys so this is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
goes on with some other guys so this is
way<00:03:17.030> we'll<00:03:17.209> start<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.500> we'll<00:03:18.680> see<00:03:18.859> what

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
way we'll start and and we'll see what

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.410 
way we'll start and and we'll see what
happens<00:03:19.070> as<00:03:19.430> we<00:03:19.720> continue<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.370> zouk<00:03:23.000> wasn't

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
happens as we continue so zouk wasn't

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.569 
happens as we continue so zouk wasn't
really<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.840> conversation<00:03:24.620> no<00:03:24.769> no<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:25.519> we

knowing<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.910> team<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.450> only<00:04:08.590> to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
knowing that the team not only to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.770 
knowing that the team not only to
survive<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:10.400> played<00:04:10.580> well<00:04:10.850> yeah<00:04:11.240> this

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
survive that but played well yeah this

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.210 
survive that but played well yeah this
comfort<00:04:12.200> there<00:04:12.350> there's<00:04:12.500> no<00:04:12.590> comfort<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
comfort there there's no comfort and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.920 
comfort there there's no comfort and
losing<00:04:13.550> Ryan<00:04:13.760> Kelly<00:04:14.000> right<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.570> wasn't<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
losing Ryan Kelly right it wasn't the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.780 
losing Ryan Kelly right it wasn't the
right<00:04:14.960> but<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.520> with<00:04:16.670> her

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
right but but just going with her

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.120 
right but but just going with her
question<00:04:17.270> here<00:04:17.480> it's<00:04:18.170> something<00:04:18.410> we<00:04:18.709> handled

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
question here it's something we handled

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.360 
question here it's something we handled
before<00:04:19.250> we've<00:04:20.120> had<00:04:20.300> to<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.860> I<00:04:21.860> think

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
before we've had to and I think

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.460 
before we've had to and I think
sometimes<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.240> galvanizes<00:04:23.720> your<00:04:23.990> team<00:04:24.170> even

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
sometimes it galvanizes your team even

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.650 
sometimes it galvanizes your team even
more<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.100> maybe<00:04:25.280> that's<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.670> good<00:04:25.700> should<00:04:26.510> say

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
more and maybe that's a good should say

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.390 
more and maybe that's a good should say
it's<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.870> good<00:04:27.050> thing<00:04:27.200> this<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.890> nothing<00:04:28.220> good

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
it's a good thing this is nothing good

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.790 
it's a good thing this is nothing good
about<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.350> need<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.560> try

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
about this but I think you need to try

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.260 
about this but I think you need to try
to<00:04:30.890> turn<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.220> into<00:04:31.490> something<00:04:31.790> that<00:04:31.970> will<00:04:32.150> help

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
to turn it into something that will help

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.300 
to turn it into something that will help
your<00:04:32.450> team<00:04:32.630> even<00:04:32.960> more<00:04:33.200> during<00:04:33.920> this<00:04:34.040> crunch

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
your team even more during this crunch

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.770 
your team even more during this crunch
time<00:04:34.550> for<00:04:34.610> us<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.210> that's<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.540> way<00:04:35.660> we're

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
time for us so that's the way we're

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.830
