00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.899 
that
and<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:13.129> opens<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.519> new<00:02:13.549> window<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:15.909> basically

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
and it opens a new window and basically

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.979 
and it opens a new window and basically
there's<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.359> readme<00:02:18.079> file<00:02:18.379> with<00:02:18.829> both<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> these

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
there's a readme file with both of these

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.959 
there's a readme file with both of these
and<00:02:20.989> what<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.769> have<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:22.159> is<00:02:22.310> replace<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
and what we have to do is replace the

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.740 
and what we have to do is replace the
provided<00:02:23.689> replace<00:02:24.680> our<00:02:24.950> old<00:02:25.239> files<00:02:26.239> which<00:02:26.629> is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
provided replace our old files which is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.490 
provided replace our old files which is
these<00:02:26.959> two<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.959> new<00:02:30.109> ones<00:02:30.290> they've

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
these two and with the new ones they've

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500 
these two and with the new ones they've
given<00:02:30.709> us<00:02:30.950> which<00:02:31.129> are<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> non<00:02:31.879> altered<00:02:32.389> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
given us which are the non altered and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.720 
given us which are the non altered and
 up<00:02:32.840> ones<00:02:33.049> but<00:02:33.889> before<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.700> that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
 up ones but before we do that

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.129 
 up ones but before we do that
before<00:02:35.000> windows<00:02:35.359> will<00:02:35.540> let<00:02:35.719> us<00:02:35.840> do<00:02:36.019> that

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
before windows will let us do that

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.420 
before windows will let us do that
because<00:02:36.349> it's<00:02:36.590> obviously<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.159> wind

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
because it's obviously in this wind

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.429 
because it's obviously in this wind
directory<00:02:37.909> and<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.269> not<00:02:38.510> an<00:02:38.659> actual<00:02:38.989> file

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
directory and it's not an actual file

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.899 
directory and it's not an actual file
path<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.980> they'll<00:02:40.099> let<00:02:40.280> us<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:40.579> without

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
path that they'll let us to do without

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.809 
path that they'll let us to do without
taking<00:02:41.239> control<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.739> system<00:02:43.159> you

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
taking control of the of the system you

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.210 
taking control of the of the system you
go<00:02:43.969> into<00:02:44.180> CMD<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:45.829> hit<00:02:45.980> start<00:02:46.340> run<00:02:48.220> run

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
go into CMD so you hit start run run

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.819 
go into CMD so you hit start run run
your<00:02:49.370> command<00:02:51.340> alright<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:54.280> there<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.459> a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
your command alright and there is a

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.690 
your command alright and there is a
simple<00:02:57.829> thing<00:02:57.980> here<00:02:58.189> that<00:02:58.219> stops<00:02:58.579> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
simple thing here that stops the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.429 
simple thing here that stops the
software<00:02:59.060> protection<00:02:59.209> service<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.230> that

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
software protection service and that

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.020 
software protection service and that
basically<00:03:00.680> allows<00:03:01.010> us<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.579> actually<00:03:01.669> copy

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
basically allows us to actually copy

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.069 
basically allows us to actually copy
these<00:03:02.209> files<00:03:02.269> over<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.810> right<00:03:08.810> there

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
these files over and that is right there

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.780 
these files over and that is right there
so<00:03:09.709> its<00:03:09.889> net<00:03:10.219> stop<00:03:10.669> spp<00:03:11.569> SVC<00:03:12.469> so<00:03:13.250> type<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.669> in

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
so its net stop spp SVC so type that in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.909 
so its net stop spp SVC so type that in
here<00:03:18.400> alright<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.090> software<00:03:20.449> process<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.169> not

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
here alright the software process is not

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.409 
here alright the software process is not
starting<00:03:22.459> place<00:03:22.669> well<00:03:22.909> that's<00:03:23.150> cuz<00:03:23.299> I've

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
starting place well that's cuz I've

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.360 
starting place well that's cuz I've
already<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.889> disabled<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.010> software

already are disabled the software

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.920 
already are disabled the software
protection<00:03:25.489> service<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:26.359> anyway<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.900> should

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
protection service but anyway it should

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.750 
protection service but anyway it should
say<00:03:27.229> it<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.500> stopping<00:03:27.979> and<00:03:28.220> then<00:03:28.340> should<00:03:28.579> say

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
say it is stopping and then should say

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.670 
say it is stopping and then should say
the<00:03:29.030> Nova<00:03:29.299> software<00:03:29.659> protection<00:03:29.810> service<00:03:30.379> is

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
the Nova software protection service is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.039 
the Nova software protection service is
stopped<00:03:31.250> alright<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.359> once<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:32.659> stopped

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049
