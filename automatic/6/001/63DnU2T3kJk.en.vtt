the amounts the amount of read rights

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.610 
the amounts the amount of read rights
that<00:03:09.400> Windows<00:03:09.760> uses<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.480> does<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.230> to

that Windows uses that does to the to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
that Windows uses that does to the to
the<00:03:11.910> SSD<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.989> as<00:03:14.260> says<00:03:14.560> these<00:03:14.769> do<00:03:15.040> have<00:03:15.069> a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the SSD because as says these do have a

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.319 
the SSD because as says these do have a

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
finite amount of read rights so you want

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.660 
finite amount of read rights so you want

to minimize as much unnecessary read

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.550 
to minimize as much unnecessary read
