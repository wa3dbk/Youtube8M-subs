00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
because you're not using electricity to

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.350 
because you're not using electricity to
open<00:03:00.560> doors<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:04.580> somewhat<00:03:05.000> impractical

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
open doors so it's somewhat impractical

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.540 
open doors so it's somewhat impractical
but<00:03:06.170> we'll<00:03:06.320> look<00:03:06.440> beyond<00:03:06.830> that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.460 

now<00:03:13.360> there<00:03:13.510> are<00:03:13.600> some<00:03:13.780> problems<00:03:14.020> with<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
now there are some problems with the

now there are some problems with the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
game and if you're going to nitpick it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.580 
game and if you're going to nitpick it
visually<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> game<00:03:16.570> does<00:03:17.020> start<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.320> look<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
visually the game does start to look the

at<00:03:37.480> least<00:03:37.510> one<00:03:38.440> major<00:03:38.680> rule<00:03:39.070> applies<00:03:39.460> you<00:03:39.820> do

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
at least one major rule applies you do

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.030 
at least one major rule applies you do
not<00:03:40.150> want<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.630> get<00:03:40.810> surrounded<00:03:41.440> by<00:03:41.620> enemies

then<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.820> becomes<00:03:43.180> very<00:03:43.270> difficult<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:44.020> defeat

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
then it becomes very difficult to defeat

then it becomes very difficult to defeat
them<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.650> want<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.980> try<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> pick<00:03:45.400> them<00:03:45.610> off

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
axe at least the one in the Genesis that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.740 
axe at least the one in the Genesis that
I<00:04:00.280> played<00:04:00.550> before<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.240> an<00:04:01.390> excellent

game to play with friends and this is a
pretty<00:04:04.030> massive<00:04:04.330> departure<00:04:05.080> from<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
pretty massive departure from the

the<00:04:07.840> combat<00:04:08.350> system<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.120> get<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.330> burn

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
the combat system but you do get to burn

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720 
the combat system but you do get to burn
people<00:04:11.020> with<00:04:11.140> monsters<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.890> cut<00:04:12.310> them<00:04:12.520> in

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
people with monsters and cut them in
