over here you could like pull these off
but<00:01:06.910> with<00:01:07.030> my<00:01:07.180> hoses<00:01:07.420> they<00:01:08.229> all<00:01:08.410> don't<00:01:08.710> really

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
but with my hoses they all don't really

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.070 
but with my hoses they all don't really
want<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.340> come<00:01:09.520> off<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.090> it's<00:01:10.750> too<00:01:10.930> much

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
think this is the intake this is the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.940 
think this is the intake this is the
exhaust

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.170 

okay<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.009> I'll<00:01:33.280> do<00:01:33.399> my<00:01:33.430> best<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.759> show<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.000> this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
okay so I'll do my best to show you this

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.020 
okay so I'll do my best to show you this
but<00:01:35.170> they<00:01:35.290> have<00:01:35.320> real<00:01:35.680> notches<00:01:36.190> right<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:36.759> here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
but they have real notches right in here

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
but they have real notches right in here
that<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.420> want<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> line<00:01:37.780> up<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:39.940> angle

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that you want to line up from this angle

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.280 
that you want to line up from this angle
yeah<00:01:41.560> everything<00:01:42.340> like<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:44.140> now

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
yeah everything like that you see now

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.420 
yeah everything like that you see now
they're<00:01:44.470> lined<00:01:44.680> up

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.990 

so<00:01:49.940> then<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.180> take<00:01:50.360> your<00:01:50.420> feeler<00:01:50.750> gauge<00:01:51.050> and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
so then you take your feeler gauge and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.210 
so then you take your feeler gauge and
just<00:01:54.160> end<00:01:55.160> up<00:01:55.310> going<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:56.320> feels<00:01:57.320> right<00:01:57.620> not<00:01:58.040> too

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
just end up going in feels right not too

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.390 
just end up going in feels right not too
loose<00:01:58.580> not<00:01:58.820> too<00:01:58.850> tight<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.980> let's<00:02:00.980> finish<00:02:01.130> it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
loose not too tight and let's finish it

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.790 
loose not too tight and let's finish it
for<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:03.400> now<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:05.540> intake<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.550> 0.1<00:02:07.550> 0<00:02:08.649> plus<00:02:09.649> or

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
for that now the intake is 0.1 0 plus or

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.150 
for that now the intake is 0.1 0 plus or
minus<00:02:10.160> okay<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.440> plus<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:12.590> minus<00:02:12.650> point

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
minus okay and the plus or minus point

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250 
minus okay and the plus or minus point
zero<00:02:13.220> 30<00:02:13.610> millimeters<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.690> exhaust<00:02:14.990> is

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
zero 30 millimeters and the exhaust is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.220 
zero 30 millimeters and the exhaust is
0.1<00:02:16.040> 9<00:02:16.310> plus<00:02:17.000> or<00:02:17.150> minus<00:02:17.480> point<00:02:17.750> zero<00:02:17.810> three

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
0.1 9 plus or minus point zero three

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.710 
0.1 9 plus or minus point zero three
millimeters<00:02:18.820> what'd<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.120> did<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:20.660> take

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
millimeters what'd you do did you take

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.940 
millimeters what'd you do did you take
one<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.900> gauges<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.820> just<00:02:25.820> stick<00:02:26.090> them<00:02:26.209> in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
one of the gauges you just stick them in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:37.089 
one of the gauges you just stick them in
see<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.010> they'll<00:02:28.220> go

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.750 

so<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> looks<00:02:37.939> like

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.500 

point<00:02:41.510> zero<00:02:41.930> two<00:02:43.090> which<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.239> freaking<00:02:45.110> like

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
point zero two which is freaking like

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.380 
point zero two which is freaking like
aluminum<00:02:47.510> foil<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:50.030> goes<00:02:50.209> between

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
aluminum foil and then that goes between

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:01.809 
aluminum foil and then that goes between
them<00:02:51.159> like<00:02:52.159> that<00:02:56.230> okay<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:59.500> no<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> have<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.610> just

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
them like that okay so no I have to just

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.009 
them like that okay so no I have to just
slide<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.269> over<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.900> little<00:03:03.560> rocker<00:03:03.739> arm<00:03:04.069> I

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
slide this over a little rocker arm I

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.259 
slide this over a little rocker arm I
put<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.319> already<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.760> it'll<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.120> pop

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
put this on already and it'll just pop

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.360 
put this on already and it'll just pop
right<00:03:08.329> off<00:03:09.730> as<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.859> well<00:03:13.040> based<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
right off as you can see it well based I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.259 
right off as you can see it well based I
don't<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.549> if<00:03:13.609> you<00:03:13.670> can't<00:03:13.849> see<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.000> or<00:03:14.150> not

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
don't know if you can't see it or not

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
don't know if you can't see it or not
but<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.620> says<00:03:15.859> 180<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.840> I'll<00:03:18.409> show<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
but this says 180 so I'll show you the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.420 
but this says 180 so I'll show you the
calculations<00:03:20.920> I'll<00:03:21.920> just<00:03:22.099> show<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.280> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
calculations I'll just show you this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.399 
calculations I'll just show you this
from<00:03:22.579> my<00:03:22.670> manual<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.959> actually<00:03:24.290> what<00:03:24.379> I

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
from my manual this is actually what I

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.910 
from my manual this is actually what I
had<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:24.950> that's<00:03:25.129> how<00:03:25.250> they<00:03:25.459> label<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.030> and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
had but that's how they label it and

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.990 
had but that's how they label it and
this<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.069> how<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:29.389> use<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.139> equation<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> now

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
this is how you use the equation so now

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.410 
this is how you use the equation so now
on<00:03:32.510> my<00:03:32.690> calculator<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:34.700> ahead<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:35.030> show<00:03:35.180> you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
on my calculator go ahead and show you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.789 
on my calculator go ahead and show you
you<00:03:36.230> ever<00:03:36.319> take<00:03:36.650> B<00:03:37.069> which<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.629> reported<00:03:39.349> so

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
you ever take B which is the reported so

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.770 
you ever take B which is the reported so
I<00:03:39.859> mine<00:03:40.129> ended<00:03:40.639> up<00:03:40.730> being<00:03:41.379> 2000<00:03:42.379> two

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
I mine ended up being 2000 two

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.129 
I mine ended up being 2000 two
subtracting<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.930> from<00:03:45.280> what<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.430> want<00:03:47.139> point

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
subtracting it from what you want point

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.050 
subtracting it from what you want point
one<00:03:48.590> zero<00:03:49.419> equals<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:51.819> then<00:03:52.819> you're<00:03:52.970> gonna

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
one zero equals that then you're gonna

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.189 
one zero equals that then you're gonna
add<00:03:53.389> that<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:58.250> sim<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.299> in

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
add that to the sim that you have in

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.770 
add that to the sim that you have in
there<00:04:00.500> right<00:04:00.709> now

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.800 

and<00:04:02.930> that's<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:04.640> it's<00:04:04.820> plus<00:04:05.060> or<00:04:05.270> minus<00:04:05.660> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and that's so it's plus or minus a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
and that's so it's plus or minus a
number<00:04:05.990> so<00:04:06.500> you're<00:04:06.860> wondering<00:04:07.100> you're<00:04:07.490> gonna

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
number so you're wondering you're gonna

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.540 
number so you're wondering you're gonna
want<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.030> get<00:04:08.120> point<00:04:08.900> zero<00:04:09.200> seven<00:04:11.110> shim<00:04:12.110> or<00:04:12.550> the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
want to get point zero seven shim or the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.590 
want to get point zero seven shim or the
number<00:04:14.060> would<00:04:14.240> be<00:04:14.950> seven<00:04:15.950> or<00:04:16.390> 170<00:04:18.130> okay<00:04:19.600> so

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
number would be seven or 170 okay so

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.670 
number would be seven or 170 okay so
then<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.840> pretty<00:04:20.989> much<00:04:21.079> just<00:04:21.170> do<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.530> same

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
then you pretty much just do the same

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.760 
then you pretty much just do the same
thing<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.300> bottom<00:04:23.540> one

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
thing to the bottom one

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.290 
thing to the bottom one
and<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.430> think<00:04:25.490> that's<00:04:25.729> gonna<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:25.970> pretty<00:04:26.150> much

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and I think that's gonna be pretty much

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.270 
and I think that's gonna be pretty much
the<00:04:26.449> end<00:04:26.509> of<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.720> video<00:04:26.960> because<00:04:27.220> once<00:04:28.220> you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
the end of the video because once you

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.129 
the end of the video because once you
bring<00:04:28.430> out<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> shin<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.090> need<00:04:29.240> you

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
bring out the shin that you need you

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.050 
bring out the shin that you need you
swap<00:04:30.500> them<00:04:30.759> and<00:04:31.810> you're<00:04:32.810> good<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:32.990> go
