00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.940
 cozy somehow me up for make up na'vi or 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.919
 when will they start pulling the guys 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.200
 they'll start hauling you guys 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.580
 virtus.pro 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 for example, more precisely the guys in us do 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 such as how virtuspro was done when 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 started dragging the main lineup of virtus.pro 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.769
 firstly when the second composition appeared 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 hail of bullets from the second lineup manager 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.939
 who sat at virtus.pro he did not understand 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 what happened to his team when they 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 play against each other there all the players 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 began to play sharply as if they were me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 I do not know as if they will win 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 world title and as a result 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 have they been very pleased because 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.649
 this feeling you competition then when 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 no longer go against other teams they 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.120
 there is something under relaxed alone and in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770
 the end is not so cool she made here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 same upstairs was a review I don't know 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 make two compositions 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 this is one of the options of course bargaining 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.260
 but all the same, and a composition of wins 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 leave or make two compositions 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 one ended on I would change the approach not 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 I know you cut for a pet I don't know three times 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.260
 but you give installation guys win 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 show results sap and increases 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 there are six seven elementary times 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 motivation with the same leaflets already 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.560
 spent the example you're on the street 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.170
 you stand standing you know leaflets 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.290
 no one cares about you at all 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.799
 you just don't care and you're not even 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.360
 interest 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:34.140
 not interested in having these 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 flyers at least give someone for m0 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.299
 motivation panic dandy after chinese 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 internet create new topic 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 no guys from the site actually so 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.049
 such an organization which in the future 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.229
 maybe we will have strength 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.000
 just starting this one over here 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.600
 warm up the people here we really want 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.250
 so that everything was good think growth could 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 would help a navin at all might 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.490
 naturally I think everyone can help 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.469
 navi any person who has experience 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.360
 I think that for example any trainer 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.439
 any one but any sports organization 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.899
 there for example cisco and dynamo we have an application 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.970
 kim kiev dynamo or these 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 there anyone can help on 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.769
