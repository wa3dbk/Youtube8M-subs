00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.330
 Hello 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.430
 Hanyang University Admission Office, which establishes entrance examination policy with students 'and parents'

 We do not do interviews either. 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.200
 Let me give you some more information about Sunyoung's big frame. 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:08.360
 The applicant will be a graduate of high school in Korea or a graduate student . 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.920
 The total number of students to be recruited is 915. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.110

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.020
 Typical elements are the student group assessment without other elements, as I mentioned earlier, 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.700

 Comprehensive review and evaluation of 10 or more evaluation items 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 Among the items we have focused on are award-winning creative experiential activities 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.380
 Of course , items after that are also items that we refer to when evaluating. 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.759
 I want to tell you. 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.020
 Through these assessments, we are able to identify the aptitude, personality, and potential 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.909
 To evaluate . 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.740

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:30.020
 I'm asking you how you would rate your grade in the overall selection. 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 We do not conduct GPA is arithmetically quantitative rating of the place of students 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.720

 As mentioned before, the competency is award-winning Seven is especially in the incense situation 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.940
 Through the three-dimensional evaluation of the student department through behavioral characteristics and comprehensive opinions, 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.190
 Measure your academic competence 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:56.360
 So, the results for the 2015 school entrance exam are as follows: 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.290

 Compare the grades of the student division with those of the assessment items that we actually evaluated. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.650

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:26.600
 The students whose class size is above the average area of ​​the earthen walls have their academic ability 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.489

 On average, students have a variety of experiences and high school achievements, 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.739
