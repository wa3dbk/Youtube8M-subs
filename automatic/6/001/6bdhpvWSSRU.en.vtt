is<00:01:34.530> fifty<00:01:34.829> percent<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.189> effective<00:01:35.640> ah<00:01:36.829> not

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
is fifty percent more effective ah not

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.420 
is fifty percent more effective ah not
fantastic<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.479> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.659> thing<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.229> helps<00:01:41.189> but

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
fantastic but it's a thing it helps but

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.020 
fantastic but it's a thing it helps but
not<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:42.210> much<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:44.490> worry<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
not very much so we worry about that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.130 
not very much so we worry about that
definitely<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.020> wells<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.829> recharge<00:01:47.220> faster

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
definitely all wells to recharge faster

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.389 
definitely all wells to recharge faster

weird<00:02:22.159> I've<00:02:23.159> put<00:02:23.459> points<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.840> my<00:02:25.049> last

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
weird I've put points here as my last

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.339 
weird I've put points here as my last
trait<00:02:25.860> line<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.909> because<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> would

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
trait line just because but I would

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.080 
trait line just because but I would
recommend<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.860> into<00:02:29.250> curses<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.760> using<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
recommend going into curses and using a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
recommend going into curses and using a
scepter<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.750> your<00:02:30.959> other<00:02:31.170> weapon<00:02:31.560> set<00:02:31.769> though

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
scepter in your other weapon set though

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.110 
scepter in your other weapon set though
because<00:02:33.650> scepters<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.920> actually<00:02:35.730> very<00:02:35.970> very

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
because scepters are actually very very

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.539 
because scepters are actually very very
powerful<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.690> conditions<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.799> no<00:02:38.370> matter

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
powerful and conditions you no matter

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.740 
powerful and conditions you no matter
what<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> she<00:02:39.329> isn't<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.569> dagger

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
what you do on the she isn't a dagger

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.000 
what you do on the she isn't a dagger
you're<00:02:40.049> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:40.319> tons<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.769> tons<00:02:40.860> of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you're going to get tons and tons of

Death Magic the benefits from curses and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.149 
Death Magic the benefits from curses and

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
my build what I've got right here then

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.249 
my build what I've got right here then
you'll<00:05:08.090> be<00:05:08.120> able<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.479> level<00:05:08.719> up<00:05:08.779> fairly<00:05:09.020> easily

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
you'll be able to level up fairly easily

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.499 
you'll be able to level up fairly easily
and<00:05:09.500> once<00:05:10.039> you've<00:05:10.189> once<00:05:10.909> you've<00:05:11.060> played<00:05:11.330> the

necro for as long as I have or for not
even<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.960> long<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.289> be<00:05:15.379> honest<00:05:15.620> you'll<00:05:16.219> pick

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
even that long to be honest you'll pick

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.920 
even that long to be honest you'll pick
it<00:05:16.460> up<00:05:16.699> you'll<00:05:17.000> understand<00:05:17.509> it<00:05:17.599> a<00:05:17.659> lot<00:05:17.810> more

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
it up you'll understand it a lot more

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.649 
it up you'll understand it a lot more
easily<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.520> then<00:05:19.520> you'll<00:05:19.699> be<00:05:19.819> making<00:05:20.120> builds

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
easily and then you'll be making builds

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.899 
easily and then you'll be making builds
and<00:05:20.810> more<00:05:21.129> effective<00:05:22.129> than<00:05:22.310> what<00:05:22.490> i<00:05:22.520> have<00:05:22.699> here

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
and more effective than what i have here

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.529 
and more effective than what i have here
it's<00:05:23.539> just<00:05:23.719> a<00:05:23.810> general<00:05:24.229> guide<00:05:24.409> like<00:05:24.650> and

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
it's just a general guide like and

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.369 
it's just a general guide like and
eventually<00:05:26.539> i'll<00:05:26.719> come<00:05:26.930> up<00:05:26.990> with<00:05:27.050> some<00:05:27.289> more

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
eventually i'll come up with some more

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.010 
eventually i'll come up with some more
builds<00:05:27.710> that<00:05:28.639> I've<00:05:28.909> you<00:05:29.180> still<00:05:29.479> tried<00:05:29.779> and

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.089 
tested and be able to talk about that

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.559 
tested and be able to talk about that
later<00:05:32.740> in<00:05:33.740> other<00:05:34.159> videos<00:05:34.490> anyway<00:05:35.300> thanks<00:05:35.539> for
