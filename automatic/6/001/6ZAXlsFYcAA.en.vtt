00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.610
 i wait for you 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.060
 is the name is how much more is stretched is 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.060
 easier 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
 all right 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.600
 is very manageable is very 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.890
 and you can talk 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.520
 Perez CandÃ¡s 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 yes 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.500
 to her 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.149
 the psp life 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.570
 and good 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.210
 I think it fits very well to what one 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.810
 wants 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.600
 the fact that it is so lend all 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 the conditions that are 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.950
 Strong rugged that is off-road is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.610
 a little the off-road mobile of are and in 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.460
 that sense 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.800
 a man for me yes for me yes 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.460
 because the monkey the fact that it is that 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.400
 can be used under water is a 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.260
 innovative new condition and I think that it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 it can give you a lot of utility 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 not now since there is nowhere 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.390
 where not where you can not take photos 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.019
 now he is taking a shower you can do 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.239
 you can take pictures, that is, give a 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.370
 step in what is technology and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.060
 the advances that there are 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.940
 well I always say the same thing to me 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.760
 unique moments are those that those who 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.290
 I have with my people with my family with 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.079
 my friends and good if it's not under water 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.650
 well outside the water I will try to do very 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.970
 good pictures 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.349
 Of course I would like it good that with this 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.620
 phone also have the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.140
 opportunity to record or photograph 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.230
 great moments this season hopefully and 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.950
 so be it 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.220
 good until now, everything is 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.920
 coming out very well and nothing will try 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.400
 that distance then try 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.470
 keep it as new as possible 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.140
 I did not get very good and just take 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.540
 also to be with my daughter because 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.500
 because today we had to travel another 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.440
 but yes, yes, it is him 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.150
 I found out about the result and with a raise it is 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.150
 a very very difficult field 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.720
 not good basically the way and doing 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.000
 of things are still being 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.370
 the same by the fact that he has 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.139
 been a long time with one in fact has 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.009
 been during all this stage with 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.910
 we the players are basically 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:43.729
 the same and good point things out 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.660
 that everyone has words I think we're going 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.390
 on the right path 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.830
 well I do not think it's a matter of 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.830
 belie I think 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:05:00.679
 in the field there are situations that are 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:05.059
 normal that happen like like two 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:07.309
 comrades are not talking about why they have 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.979
 to get along badly, much less me 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:14.929
 I think so if they did not get along well 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:17.929
 the successes or the performance of them 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:22.220
 no it would not be the one that is therefore it is 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:25.490
 something that is a unasur 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.850
 each each club each each one 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.940
 use the quarry from your 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.590
 point of view his way of seeing it I just 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.890
 I can say that I'm where I've been 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.560
 been in the ideal club because they did not 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.500
 quarry but above all, as the 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.260
 people trust her and that's the most 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.290
 important I 've always said that I 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.670
 I'd like to be there to be there 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.560
 because it's something something beautiful that people 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.300
 recognize your thing but it's good 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.230
 I've always said also that it's not something 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.160
 that obsesses me I do not always like that 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.230
 people judge me from outside do not 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.990
 I like to judge myself 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:16.780
 we know we know how we are and so 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.680
 I prefer it to be from abroad 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:24.910
 and take the opportunity to send a photo from 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:30.390
 from panama with the xperia go and try 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:33.270
 make it a beautiful and happy photo 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.730
 for sony xperia goes our new 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.590
 bet the latest smartphone the most 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.970
 resistant market and we hope 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.760
 that surprises all of our 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.580
 followers 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.100
 with hesperia go make a bet 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.540
 fundamental for us and we give a 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.810
 step more that is what we like to do 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.940
 every day trying to open and empower 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.840
 a category that we believe every time 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.810
 it is more important for our 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.640
 consumers the smartphone is clear 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.950
 which is a device that always carries 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.650
 with you and that every time we submit to 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.270
 most important challenges then good 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.490
 to have a smartphone with the 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.160
 latest market features and that 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.670
 It also allows us to subject or expose 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.820
 to challenges where you can face water 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:20.330
 or the blows and situations 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.910
 difficult with which we live we passed 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.950
 every day, well, we think it's going to 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.670
 very well be a very interesting bet 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.380
 for the consumer and that will have a 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.710
 very very good host 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:37.200
 good that I'm going to tell you about it and 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:40.650
 to be able to count on one of the most 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.210
 relevant aspects of world football and that 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.389
 also represents some very values 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.410
 that fits very well with are and as a brand 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:52.280
 The truth is that it is a luxury and 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.930
 we are having very collaboration 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.509
 interesting I think we 're both 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.090
 very happy and also that is being 

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:01.090
 transmitting to our fans
