alike and two examples for each pattern
enjoy<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> first<00:00:21.660> pattern<00:00:22.289> I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

show you is Oregon it can be any shape
and<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.510> read<00:00:27.720> clockwise<00:00:28.260> or

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and to read clockwise or

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.260 
and to read clockwise or
counterclockwise

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.370 

there's<00:00:36.270> tipple<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
there's tipple in it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.139 
there's tipple in it
just<00:00:37.950> lots<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> circles<00:00:40.399> next<00:00:41.399> pattern<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
just lots of circles next pattern is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
just lots of circles next pattern is
Kiko<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.710> reminds<00:00:44.219> me<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.000> basket<00:00:45.950> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Kiko it reminds me of the basket this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840 
Kiko it reminds me of the basket this
one<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.640> does

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.700 

ona<00:00:52.570> motto<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:53.579> string<00:00:54.579> or<00:00:55.030> rope<00:00:55.780> made<00:00:56.680> of

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
ona motto a string or rope made of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.270 
ona motto a string or rope made of
silicosis<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:58.480> looks<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:59.050> like<00:00:59.170> his<00:00:59.559> name<00:00:59.920> on

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
silicosis it looks just like his name on

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.790 
silicosis it looks just like his name on
a<00:01:00.340> motto<00:01:00.820> as

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.370 

well<00:01:05.390> Wow<00:01:06.860> okay<00:01:08.240> draw<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.510> either<00:01:09.780> clockwise

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
well Wow okay draw it either clockwise

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.820 
well Wow okay draw it either clockwise
or<00:01:10.740> counterclockwise

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.990 

I've<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.610> realized<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.450> looks<00:01:22.660> like<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:23.170> fan

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I've just realized it looks like a fan

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020 
I've just realized it looks like a fan
stripe<00:01:25.000> egg<00:01:25.380> basically<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:27.040> just<00:01:27.220> lots<00:01:27.820> of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
stripe egg basically it's just lots of

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.480 
stripe egg basically it's just lots of
stripes<00:01:28.410> but<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.590> think<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.010> difficult

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.850 

can<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.180> see<00:01:34.390> what<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.840> secret<00:01:35.020> shaving<00:01:35.680> is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
can you see what the secret shaving is

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.300 
can you see what the secret shaving is
out

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.970 

printouts<00:01:39.480> I've<00:01:40.480> seen<00:01:40.930> four<00:01:41.260> kinds<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.800> this

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
printouts I've seen four kinds of this

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.160 
printouts I've seen four kinds of this
pattern<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.700> I'm<00:01:43.090> not<00:01:43.270> sure<00:01:43.510> which<00:01:43.750> one<00:01:43.960> is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
pattern and I'm not sure which one is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.070 
pattern and I'm not sure which one is
correct<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.740> be<00:01:44.770> honest<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.550> guess<00:01:46.330> it's<00:01:46.630> okay

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
correct to be honest I guess it's okay

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.190 
correct to be honest I guess it's okay
to<00:01:47.110> draw<00:01:47.530> any<00:01:47.830> of<00:01:48.040> them<00:01:48.310> I've<00:01:49.240> added<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.990> little

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
to draw any of them I've added a little

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
to draw any of them I've added a little
bit<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.830> shade<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.840> here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
bit of shade to this one is here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.130 
bit of shade to this one is here
chaining<00:01:55.380> looks<00:01:56.380> like<00:01:56.710> hair<00:01:57.280> braids

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.410 

just<00:02:01.140> thought<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.860> could<00:02:02.010> be<00:02:02.190> like<00:02:02.460> us<00:02:02.880> leaves

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just thought it could be like us leaves

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.120 
just thought it could be like us leaves
then<00:02:04.190> paradox<00:02:05.750> start<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:06.990> any<00:02:07.350> corner<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
then paradox start from any corner you

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.540 
then paradox start from any corner you
like<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.990> sure<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> spaces<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.310> not

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
like and make sure the spaces are not

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.510 
like and make sure the spaces are not
too<00:02:11.820> big<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.140> result<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:13.920> really

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
too big or the result would not really

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.340 
too big or the result would not really
look<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.760> paradox<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.160> experience<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
look like paradox just my experience I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.750 
look like paradox just my experience I
love<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.560> pattern<00:02:19.890> because<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.459> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
love this pattern because it is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.510 
love this pattern because it is
surprising<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.500> wouldn't<00:02:22.860> really<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.100> what

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
surprising you wouldn't really know what

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
surprising you wouldn't really know what
it<00:02:23.670> would<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:24.000> look<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> end

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it would actually look like in the end

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.520 
it would actually look like in the end
when<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.680> drying<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.810> quandary<00:02:27.810> is

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
when you are drying it a quandary is

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.320 
when you are drying it a quandary is
like<00:02:29.400> flowers<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.630> six<00:02:31.200> petals<00:02:31.530> each<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
like flowers with six petals each and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.850 
like flowers with six petals each and
this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.870> how<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> draw<00:02:34.709> it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.680 

it<00:02:40.310> was<00:02:40.670> inspired<00:02:41.300> by<00:02:41.540> rewind<00:02:42.290> button<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it was inspired by rewind button the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.990 
it was inspired by rewind button the
last<00:02:44.900> pattern<00:02:45.670> true<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:48.020> process<00:02:48.740> on<00:02:49.010> top<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
last pattern true to process on top and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:08.280 
last pattern true to process on top and
a<00:02:50.720> flower<00:02:51.010> Qaeda<00:02:52.120> underneath

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.130
