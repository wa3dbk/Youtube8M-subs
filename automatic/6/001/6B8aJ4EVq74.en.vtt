00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
die I think she will and even if she

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.630 
die I think she will and even if she
doesn't<00:02:56.170> even<00:02:56.320> if<00:02:56.620> she<00:02:56.800> lives<00:02:57.040> she'll<00:02:57.340> be<00:02:57.459> too

doesn't even if she lives she'll be too
weak<00:02:57.940> she's<00:02:58.239> she's<00:02:59.110> born<00:02:59.500> three<00:02:59.980> weeks<00:03:00.220> early
