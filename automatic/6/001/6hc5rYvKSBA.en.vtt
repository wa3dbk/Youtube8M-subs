00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
mostly forgot that the thumbstick was

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
mostly forgot that the thumbstick was
even<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.210> once<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> while<00:00:42.989> when<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> needed

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
even there once in a while when I needed

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
even there once in a while when I needed
to<00:00:43.530> peek<00:00:43.680> around<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.950> corner<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.399> something<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to peek around a corner or something it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.240 
to peek around a corner or something it
was<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.390> helpful<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> time

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
was a little helpful but most the time

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
was a little helpful but most the time
of<00:00:47.489> Z<00:00:47.579> targeting<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.719> more<00:00:48.960> handy

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
of Z targeting just like is more handy

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.660 
of Z targeting just like is more handy
because<00:00:49.620> most<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> Zelda<00:00:50.460> game<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
because most time in a Zelda game you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.160 
because most time in a Zelda game you
just<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> looking<00:00:51.390> forward<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:52.020> any

review to the new 3d the super stable 3d

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
review to the new 3d the super stable 3d
is<00:00:59.039> their<00:00:59.219> marketing<00:00:59.850> name<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
is their marketing name for it but it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
is their marketing name for it but it
really<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:00.780> work<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.699> made

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
really does work and that actually made

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
really does work and that actually made
me<00:01:02.879> play<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.390> 3d<00:01:04.040> more<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> game<00:01:05.610> than<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
me play in 3d more in this game than I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
me play in 3d more in this game than I
think<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.510> probably<00:01:07.080> any<00:01:07.320> 3gs<00:01:07.710> game

a review you're trying to complete the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.310 
a review you're trying to complete the
game<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> sometimes<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.080> would<00:01:28.200> be

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
game so that sometimes I would be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
game so that sometimes I would be
starting<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> path<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> side<00:01:30.119> quest

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
starting down the path of a side quest

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
starting down the path of a side quest
would<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
would be like I need to get back on the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
would be like I need to get back on the
main<00:01:31.740> path<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:34.049> might<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:34.650> me

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
main path and that might be what bit me

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200 
main path and that might be what bit me
later<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> didn't<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.030> enough

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
later when I when I didn't have enough

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
later when I when I didn't have enough
side<00:01:36.390> quests<00:01:36.750> finished<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.470> into<00:01:37.650> some

use<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.780> most<00:03:16.990> are<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.710> Deku<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> Quran<00:03:18.580> in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
use the most are the Deku the Quran in

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.990 
use the most are the Deku the Quran in
the<00:03:18.790> Zora<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:20.140> those<00:03:21.010> are<00:03:21.040> still<00:03:21.580> just<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
the Zora and those are still just in the

in<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.330> masks<00:03:22.750> menu<00:03:22.990> there's<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.260> there's<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
in the masks menu there's a there's a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.990 
in the masks menu there's a there's a
dedicated<00:03:23.920> masks<00:03:24.340> button<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.880> can

dedicated masks button that you can
press<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:26.170> just<00:03:26.380> brings<00:03:26.530> up<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.770> masks<00:03:27.070> menu

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
press that just brings up the masks menu

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.730 
press that just brings up the masks menu
but<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.580> start<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.880> swap<00:03:28.060> them<00:03:28.240> out<00:03:28.300> manually

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
but you start to swap them out manually

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.840 
but you start to swap them out manually
it'd<00:03:29.740> be<00:03:29.860> nice<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.460> like<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> quick

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
it'd be nice to do is just like a quick

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.520 
it'd be nice to do is just like a quick

main<00:03:32.800> mask<00:03:33.220> really<00:03:34.060> quick<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.680> would<00:03:35.800> have

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
main mask really quick that would have

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.230 
main mask really quick that would have
been<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.010> little<00:03:36.130> more<00:03:36.310> handy<00:03:36.670> i<00:03:36.700> also<00:03:36.940> think

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
been a little more handy i also think

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.090 
been a little more handy i also think
one<00:03:37.690> thing<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.870> i<00:03:38.020> noticed<00:03:38.050> while<00:03:38.770> while

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
one thing that i noticed while while

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.390 
one thing that i noticed while while
trying<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> navigate<00:03:39.550> an<00:03:39.940> extremely<00:03:40.630> tricky

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
trying to navigate an extremely tricky

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.150 
trying to navigate an extremely tricky
portion<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.670> Goron<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:44.200> end<00:03:44.350> there's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
portion of the Goron at the end there's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.410 
portion of the Goron at the end there's
one<00:03:45.220> part<00:03:45.550> where<00:03:45.670> there's<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.970> very<00:03:46.209> narrow

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
one part where there's a very narrow

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.580 
one part where there's a very narrow
path<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.140> have<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.350> be<00:03:47.410> looking

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
path you really have to be looking

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.050 
path you really have to be looking
straight<00:03:47.920> on<00:03:48.040> when<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.310> start<00:03:48.340> rolling<00:03:48.910> as

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
straight on when you start rolling as

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.020 
straight on when you start rolling as
the<00:03:49.180> Goron<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.620> occurred<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.860> me<00:03:50.950> that's<00:03:51.940> a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
the Goron and it occurred to me that's a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.110 
the Goron and it occurred to me that's a
lot<00:03:52.180> harder<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.750> 3ds<00:03:53.170> because<00:03:53.860> on<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> n64

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
lot harder on the 3ds because on the n64

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.170 
lot harder on the 3ds because on the n64
it<00:03:55.600> had<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.800> analog<00:03:57.130> stick<00:03:57.160> but<00:03:57.550> at<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:58.030> edge

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it had the analog stick but at the edge

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.699 
it had the analog stick but at the edge
of<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.420> analog<00:03:58.660> stick<00:03:58.720> for<00:03:59.020> those<00:03:59.140> eight<00:03:59.380> sort

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
of the analog stick for those eight sort

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.560 
of the analog stick for those eight sort
of<00:03:59.770> cardinal<00:04:00.160> points<00:04:00.520> so<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.270> wanted<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
of cardinal points so if you wanted to

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.270 
of cardinal points so if you wanted to
go<00:04:01.660> straight<00:04:01.959> forward<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.530> would<00:04:02.650> press<00:04:03.100> up

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
go straight forward you would press up

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.100 
go straight forward you would press up
and<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.520> would<00:04:03.610> stay<00:04:03.850> steady<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.750> on<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and it would stay steady on the on the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.470 
and it would stay steady on the on the
forward<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.520> 3d<00:04:06.730> s<00:04:06.880> doesn't<00:04:07.030> have<00:04:07.330> that

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
forward the 3d s doesn't have that

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.520 
forward the 3d s doesn't have that
eighth<00:04:07.660> cardinal<00:04:08.050> points<00:04:08.430> sort<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.520> geometry

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
eighth cardinal points sort of geometry

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.110 
eighth cardinal points sort of geometry
so<00:04:11.530> i<00:04:11.590> found<00:04:11.800> myself<00:04:11.950> sort<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.370> rolling<00:04:12.820> very

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
so i found myself sort of rolling very

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.330 
so i found myself sort of rolling very
slightly<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.900> side<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.380> side<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.860> rolling<00:04:15.190> off

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
slightly to side to side and rolling off

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.610 
slightly to side to side and rolling off
the<00:04:15.370> edge<00:04:15.610> one<00:04:15.880> way<00:04:16.000> or<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.209> other<00:04:16.270> and<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.780> was

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
the edge one way or the other and it was

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.840 
the edge one way or the other and it was
actually<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.920> lot<00:04:18.070> trickier<00:04:18.280> because<00:04:18.549> of<00:04:18.730> that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
actually a lot trickier because of that

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.940 
actually a lot trickier because of that
no<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:19.450> use<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.840> gyroscope<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.710> 3d

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
no can you use the gyroscope in the 3d

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
no can you use the gyroscope in the 3d
este<00:04:21.220> to

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
este to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.300 
este to
aim<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> go<00:04:22.360> around<00:04:22.510> or<00:04:22.690> no<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.800> don't<00:04:24.220> know

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
aim to go around or no I don't know

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.650 
aim to go around or no I don't know
about<00:04:24.400> aiming<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.850> Goron<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.360> didn't<00:04:25.540> actually

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
about aiming the Goron I didn't actually

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.090 
about aiming the Goron I didn't actually
try<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.440> turned<00:04:26.770> off<00:04:26.920> motion

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
try for that I turned off motion

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.510 
try for that I turned off motion
controls<00:04:27.610> um<00:04:28.390> almost<00:04:29.080> as<00:04:29.590> soon<00:04:29.800> as<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.160> figured

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
controls um almost as soon as I figured

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.460 
controls um almost as soon as I figured
out<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.700> they<00:04:30.880> were<00:04:30.940> on<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.900> was<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.350> the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
out that they were on it was one of the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.200 
out that they were on it was one of the
it<00:04:32.920> was<00:04:33.040> one<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.340> first<00:04:33.550> dungeons<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.090> had

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
it was one of the first dungeons you had

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.700 
it was one of the first dungeons you had
the<00:04:34.300> aim<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:34.600> arrow<00:04:34.780> very<00:04:35.080> carefully<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.650> I

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the aim and arrow very carefully and I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.900 
the aim and arrow very carefully and I
kept<00:04:35.920> missing<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.400> was<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:36.580> what<00:04:36.760> am<00:04:36.850> i

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
kept missing and I was like what am i

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.500 
kept missing and I was like what am i
doing<00:04:37.180> wrong<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.630> him<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:38.640> I'm<00:04:39.640> aiming<00:04:40.270> so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
doing wrong like him like I'm aiming so

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.060 
doing wrong like him like I'm aiming so
carefully<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.110> then<00:04:41.320> when<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.500> released<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
carefully and then when I released the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.650 
carefully and then when I released the
button<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.910> didn't<00:04:43.120> realize<00:04:43.300> was<00:04:43.510> when<00:04:43.630> I

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
button but I didn't realize was when I

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.060 
button but I didn't realize was when I
released<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.050> button<00:04:44.260> my<00:04:44.320> hand<00:04:44.530> was<00:04:44.680> moving

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
released the button my hand was moving

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.280

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
kind of hard not to recommend it but

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.470 
kind of hard not to recommend it but
it's<00:04:59.890> this<00:05:00.040> game<00:05:00.280> up<00:05:00.460> for<00:05:00.670> sure<00:05:00.820> by<00:05:01.030> should

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
wait so it goes lower or should you just

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.210

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
rent it or borrow from a friend I think

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.770 
rent it or borrow from a friend I think
that<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.670> depends<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.210> where<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.720> stand
