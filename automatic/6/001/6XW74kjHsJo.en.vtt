00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.389 

however<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.870> probably<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.829> nail<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
however i did probably like nail this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.790 
however i did probably like nail this
part<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.920> well<00:00:49.920> almost<00:00:50.370> sort<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
part like right here well almost sort of

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.520 
part like right here well almost sort of
and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.520> part<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.740 

and<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.250> overall<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.760> think<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.270> is<00:01:01.329> just<00:01:01.480> a

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
and so overall I think this is just a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.260 
and so overall I think this is just a
really<00:01:01.989> cool<00:01:02.590> mini<00:01:03.219> figure<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.830> yeah<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:07.000> not
