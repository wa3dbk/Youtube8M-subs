00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
10 you point out flaws because you're a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610 
10 you point out flaws because you're a
critic<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.389> some<00:03:09.900> people<00:03:10.200> when<00:03:10.349> they<00:03:10.470> buy

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
critic and some people when they buy

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
critic and some people when they buy
this<00:03:10.680> game<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.280> because<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.670> DBZ<00:03:11.970> cannot

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
this game and because as a DBZ cannot

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449 
this game and because as a DBZ cannot
handle<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.170> type<00:03:13.409> of<00:03:13.470> criticism<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.340> they

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
handle that type of criticism so they

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.640 
handle that type of criticism so they
say<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:15.120> suck<00:03:15.480> or<00:03:15.690> Joe<00:03:15.840> doesn't<00:03:16.079> understand
