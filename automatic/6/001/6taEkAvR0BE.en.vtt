accepts three parameters
there's<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.470> fade<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> time<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:57.719> long<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
there's the fade in time the how long it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
there's the fade in time the how long it
stays<00:01:58.079> around<00:01:58.469> time<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.640> fade<00:01:59.820> out<00:01:59.850> time

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
stays around time and the fade out time

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.359 
stays around time and the fade out time
and<00:02:00.570> these<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.200> in-game<00:02:01.560> ticks<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.189> are

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and these are in-game ticks which are

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
and these are in-game ticks which are
one<00:02:02.579> twentieth<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> second<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one twentieth of a second so here this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
one twentieth of a second so here this
is<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:05.299> five<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
is going to be five it's just going to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
is going to be five it's just going to
appear<00:02:08.129> instantly<00:02:08.399> stick<00:02:08.819> around<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.179> five

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
appear instantly stick around for five

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
appear instantly stick around for five
game<00:02:09.599> ticks<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:10.709> disappear<00:02:11.039> instantly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
game ticks and then disappear instantly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
game ticks and then disappear instantly
so<00:02:11.459> that'll<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> quarter<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> second<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
so that'll be a quarter of a second and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.510 
so that'll be a quarter of a second and
so<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> display<00:02:13.860> something<00:02:14.160> very

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
so you can display something very

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.500 
so you can display something very
quickly<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.820> but<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.090> says<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
quickly like that but this says the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
quickly like that but this says the
world<00:02:18.660> word<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> day<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.410> quibble<00:02:19.920> but

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
world word of the day is quibble but

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.280 
world word of the day is quibble but
yeah<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.090> there's<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.300> there's<00:02:21.930> quite<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> bit<00:02:22.260> of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
yeah so there's a there's quite a bit of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
yeah so there's a there's quite a bit of
configurability<00:02:22.800> there<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.850> think<00:02:24.000> it'll

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
configurability there and I think it'll

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
configurability there and I think it'll
be<00:02:24.150> definitely<00:02:24.510> very<00:02:24.750> useful<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> UI

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
be definitely very useful as a UI

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.000 
be definitely very useful as a UI
element<00:02:26.340> because<00:02:27.260> really<00:02:28.260> previously<00:02:28.830> there

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
element because really previously there

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.790 
element because really previously there
was<00:02:29.100> no<00:02:29.160> good<00:02:29.520> way<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.260> display<00:02:31.260> stuff<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
was no good way to display stuff to the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.550 
was no good way to display stuff to the
player<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.310> make<00:02:32.580> sure<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.150> saw<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
player and make sure they really saw it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.360 
player and make sure they really saw it
you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.740> also<00:02:34.860> use<00:02:35.160> title<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:37.190> reset<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> reset

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you can also use title a reset to reset

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.950 
you can also use title a reset to reset
the<00:02:38.760> amount<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.060> time<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.540> stuff<00:02:39.750> stays

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the amount of time that stuff stays

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.380 
the amount of time that stuff stays
around<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.670> press<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.180> one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
around for so if I if I press this one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.080 
around for so if I if I press this one
it's<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> show<00:02:43.980> things<00:02:44.190> quickly<00:02:44.520> then

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's going to show things quickly then

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.370 
it's going to show things quickly then
if<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.300> press<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> show

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
if I press this one it's going to show

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.270 
if I press this one it's going to show
quickly<00:02:46.770> again<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.670> title<00:02:48.330> at<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.660> reset<00:02:49.280> resets

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
quickly again so title at a reset resets

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
quickly again so title at a reset resets
my<00:02:50.460> my<00:02:50.970> timing<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.870> will<00:02:52.320> stick

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
my my timing so that it will stick

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.350 
my my timing so that it will stick
around<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:52.740> longer<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.820> other<00:02:53.970> thing<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.210> want

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
around for longer the other thing I want

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
around for longer the other thing I want
to<00:02:54.450> show<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.630> from<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> snapshot<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
to show you from the snapshot is just a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.460 
to show you from the snapshot is just a
really<00:02:56.100> simple<00:02:56.220> change<00:02:56.610> Mesa<00:02:57.540> biomes<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
really simple change Mesa biomes and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.680 
really simple change Mesa biomes and
deserts<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.310> stuff<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.940> now<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.540> have

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
deserts and stuff can now actually have

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990 
deserts and stuff can now actually have
caves<00:03:00.990> spawn<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.710> them<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.460> was<00:03:02.700> not

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
caves spawn in them this was not

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.480 
caves spawn in them this was not
possible<00:03:03.270> before<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:04.620> caves<00:03:04.950> were

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
possible before because when caves were

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.810 
possible before because when caves were
generated<00:03:06.090> they<00:03:06.830> wouldn't<00:03:07.830> cut<00:03:08.370> through

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
generated they wouldn't cut through

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.500 
generated they wouldn't cut through
stuff<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.810> stained<00:03:10.410> clay<00:03:10.770> or<00:03:11.100> sand<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.360> now

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
stuff like stained clay or sand so now

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.930 
stuff like stained clay or sand so now
you<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:13.140> these<00:03:13.770> funny-looking<00:03:14.100> caves<00:03:14.580> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
you have these funny-looking caves that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.960 
you have these funny-looking caves that
are<00:03:15.060> layered<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.320> go<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.940> look

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
are layered as you go down and they look

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.330 
are layered as you go down and they look
pretty<00:03:18.210> cool<00:03:18.360> actually<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.100> know<00:03:20.130> once

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
pretty cool actually but you know once

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
pretty cool actually but you know once
you<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.490> down<00:03:20.610> far<00:03:20.820> enough<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.270> going

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
you get down far enough it's just going

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.320 
you get down far enough it's just going
to<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.510> stoned<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:23.160> yeah<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.610> now<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
to be stoned but but yeah so now that

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.460 
to be stoned but but yeah so now that
now<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> Mesa<00:03:24.780> vibes<00:03:25.110> are<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
now the Mesa vibes are going to have a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.560 
now the Mesa vibes are going to have a
little<00:03:25.590> bit<00:03:25.740> more<00:03:25.890> stuff<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.580> them<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.970> so

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
little bit more stuff in them and so

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.990 
little bit more stuff in them and so
that's<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.930> think<00:03:27.960> it's<00:03:28.170> pretty<00:03:28.350> cool<00:03:28.500> because

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
that's I think it's pretty cool because

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.310 
that's I think it's pretty cool because
previously<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.180> was<00:03:30.630> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.900> hard<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.080> find

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
previously it was kind of hard to find

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.640 
previously it was kind of hard to find
caves<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.220> were<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.430> say<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> desert<00:03:33.650> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
caves if you were in say a desert so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.310 
caves if you were in say a desert so
yeah<00:03:34.800> that's<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.370> small<00:03:35.490> change<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.780> guess

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
yeah that's just a small change I guess

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720 
yeah that's just a small change I guess
there's<00:03:37.530> one<00:03:37.770> more<00:03:38.040> thing<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.400> want<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.610> mention

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
there's one more thing I want to mention

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.720 
there's one more thing I want to mention
let's<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.870> out<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.140> here

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
let's get out of here

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.520 
let's get out of here
what<00:03:41.730> borders<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.570> received<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.230> slight

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
what borders have received a slight

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.199 
what borders have received a slight
update<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.240> world<00:03:45.720> border<00:03:46.310> Center<00:03:47.310> tilde

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
update so it's world border Center tilde

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.230 
update so it's world border Center tilde
tilde<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.890> if<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.100> create<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.640> small<00:03:50.940> world

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
tilde so if I create a small world

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.480 
tilde so if I create a small world
border<00:03:51.600> say<00:03:52.230> five<00:03:53.209> whoops<00:03:54.209> set<00:03:54.750> five

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
border say five whoops set five

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.400 
border say five whoops set five
previously<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.850> couldn't<00:03:57.180> move<00:03:57.270> around<00:03:57.570> if

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
previously you couldn't move around if

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.600 
previously you couldn't move around if
you<00:03:58.590> set<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> were<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.550> outside

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
you set this and you were on the outside

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.030 
you set this and you were on the outside
which<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.570> bad<00:04:00.750> because<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.680> know<00:04:01.800> you're

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
which is bad because you you know you're

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
which is bad because you you know you're
taking<00:04:02.160> damage<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.030> if<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.720> go<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.930> game<00:04:04.080> on<00:04:04.200> zero

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
taking damage so if I go to game on zero

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.860 
taking damage so if I go to game on zero
here<00:04:04.620> I'm<00:04:04.680> taking<00:04:04.800> damage<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.570> can

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
here I'm taking damage so I can I can

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.960 
here I'm taking damage so I can I can
now<00:04:06.990> get<00:04:07.500> myself<00:04:07.680> inside<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> inside<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
now get myself inside the inside the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.960 
now get myself inside the inside the
world<00:04:09.240> border<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.459> won't<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.790> able<00:04:11.850> to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
world border and I won't be able to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.840 
world border and I won't be able to
leave<00:04:12.150> again<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.840> if<00:04:13.080> if<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.100> world<00:04:14.400> border

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
leave again but if if the world border

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.039 
leave again but if if the world border
let's<00:04:15.209> see<00:04:15.390> world<00:04:15.690> borders<00:04:16.109> set<00:04:17.450> say<00:04:18.450> 20<00:04:18.870> I

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
let's see world borders set say 20 I

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.440 
let's see world borders set say 20 I
come<00:04:19.530> out<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:20.010> now<00:04:20.160> let's<00:04:20.700> say<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.970> set<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.419> to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
come out here now let's say I set it to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.930 
come out here now let's say I set it to
five<00:04:21.810> over<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.410> next<00:04:22.530> five<00:04:22.710> seconds<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.820> know

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
five over the next five seconds you know

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.580 
five over the next five seconds you know
it<00:04:24.030> may<00:04:24.120> could<00:04:24.330> shrink<00:04:24.600> past<00:04:24.960> me<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.350> then<00:04:25.440> I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
it may could shrink past me and then I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.860 
it may could shrink past me and then I
start<00:04:25.860> taking<00:04:25.979> damage

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
start taking damage

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.230 
start taking damage
and<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.889> so<00:04:28.370> now<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:28.730> actually<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.120> way<00:04:29.180> to

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
and and so now there's actually a way to

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.760 
and and so now there's actually a way to
deal<00:04:29.449> with<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:30.080> that's<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.410> think<00:04:30.470> that's<00:04:30.620> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
deal with it so that's I think that's a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.800 
deal with it so that's I think that's a
good<00:04:30.889> change<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:32.240> yeah<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.389> guess<00:04:32.600> that's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
good change but yeah I guess that's

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.180 
good change but yeah I guess that's
that's<00:04:33.080> all<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.470> really<00:04:33.800> have<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.070> show

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
that's all that I really have to show

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.040 
that's all that I really have to show
you<00:04:34.250> again<00:04:34.639> quick<00:04:35.090> video<00:04:35.360> for<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.630> snapshot

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050
