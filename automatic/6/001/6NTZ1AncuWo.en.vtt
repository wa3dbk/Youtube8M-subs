00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
course its touch interface but before I

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.650 
course its touch interface but before I
get<00:00:29.439> too<00:00:29.769> far<00:00:29.800> into<00:00:30.400> describing<00:00:31.119> that<00:00:31.449> let's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
get too far into describing that let's

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.550 
get too far into describing that let's
just<00:00:31.779> look<00:00:31.929> at<00:00:32.050> some<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.410> physical

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
just look at some of the physical

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.170 
just look at some of the physical
characteristics<00:00:33.400> of<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.579> watch<00:00:33.820> itself

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
characteristics of the watch itself

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.970 
characteristics of the watch itself
we're<00:00:35.020> looking<00:00:35.260> at<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.440> thirty<00:00:35.740> nine

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
we're looking at a thirty nine

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.370 
we're looking at a thirty nine
millimeter<00:00:36.670> dial<00:00:37.060> size<00:00:37.240> so<00:00:37.780> it's<00:00:37.900> not<00:00:38.020> too<00:00:38.230> big

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
millimeter dial size so it's not too big

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.650 
millimeter dial size so it's not too big
it's<00:00:38.440> very<00:00:38.920> lightweight<00:00:39.250> it's<00:00:39.969> a<00:00:40.120> nossa<00:00:40.300> lock

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
it's very lightweight it's a nossa lock

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.350 
it's very lightweight it's a nossa lock

ridges<00:00:43.840> on<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.079> inside<00:00:44.500> here<00:00:44.860> for<00:00:45.070> comfort

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
ridges on the inside here for comfort

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.130 
ridges on the inside here for comfort
and<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:46.030> must<00:00:46.239> say<00:00:46.390> it's<00:00:46.570> actually<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.930> very

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
and I must say it's actually a very

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.900 
and I must say it's actually a very
comfortable<00:00:47.620> watch<00:00:47.770> it's<00:00:48.250> got<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.550> exposed

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
comfortable watch it's got the exposed

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.229 
comfortable watch it's got the exposed
battery<00:00:49.390> right<00:00:49.629> there<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.109> a<00:00:50.710> standard

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
battery right there and a standard

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.560 
battery right there and a standard
buckle<00:00:52.239> nothing<00:00:53.140> too<00:00:53.940> notable<00:00:54.940> there<00:00:55.120> one

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
buckle nothing too notable there one

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.060 
buckle nothing too notable there one
thing<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.930> consider<00:00:56.109> when<00:00:56.530> you're<00:00:56.590> buying<00:00:56.739> an

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
thing to consider when you're buying an

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.919 
thing to consider when you're buying an
all-white<00:00:57.519> watch<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:58.180> that<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.690> going<00:00:58.840> to

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
all-white watch is that this is going to

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.639 
all-white watch is that this is going to
show<00:00:59.170> dirt<00:00:59.969> faster<00:01:00.969> than<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.510> darker<00:01:02.350> colored

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
show dirt faster than a darker colored

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.110 
show dirt faster than a darker colored
watch<00:01:02.859> so<00:01:03.190> that's<00:01:03.370> just<00:01:03.550> something<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.910> need

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
watch so that's just something you need

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.050 
watch so that's just something you need
to<00:01:04.239> be<00:01:04.540> aware<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.370> set<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> think<00:01:06.820> it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
to be aware of with that set I think it

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.460 
to be aware of with that set I think it
would<00:01:07.180> be<00:01:07.270> relatively<00:01:07.660> easy<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.050> clean<00:01:08.350> this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
would be relatively easy to clean this

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.960 
would be relatively easy to clean this
up<00:01:08.530> since<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.100> just<00:01:09.160> silicon<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.850> not

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
up since it's just silicon it's not

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.330 
up since it's just silicon it's not
leather<00:01:10.180> or<00:01:10.450> anything<00:01:10.660> like<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:10.980> so<00:01:11.980> I'm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
leather or anything like that so I'm

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.860 
leather or anything like that so I'm
going<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.550> actually<00:01:12.790> put<00:01:13.120> this<00:01:13.240> on<00:01:13.300> my<00:01:13.660> wrist

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
going to actually put this on my wrist

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.690 
going to actually put this on my wrist
now<00:01:14.140> because<00:01:14.530> in<00:01:14.650> order<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.890> demonstrate<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
now because in order to demonstrate the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.630 
now because in order to demonstrate the
touch<00:01:15.910> features<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.660> find<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.410> easier<00:01:17.800> if<00:01:18.130> it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
touch features I find it easier if it's

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.510 
touch features I find it easier if it's
actually<00:01:19.150> fastened<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.960> my<00:01:20.140> wrist<00:01:20.440> so<00:01:20.800> bear

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
actually fastened to my wrist so bear

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.080 
actually fastened to my wrist so bear
with<00:01:21.550> me<00:01:21.760> one<00:01:22.030> moment<00:01:22.210> while<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.600> put<00:01:22.900> it<00:01:22.990> on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
with me one moment while I put it on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.630 
with me one moment while I put it on
nice<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.120> snug<00:01:28.140> ok<00:01:29.140> great<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:30.190> I'm<00:01:30.400> going<00:01:30.550> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
nice and snug ok great so I'm going to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.080 
nice and snug ok great so I'm going to
zoom<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:30.970> now<00:01:31.000> so<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.540> can<00:01:31.720> see<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:33.220> we<00:01:33.340> go

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.120 

so<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.810> area<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.350> bottom<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.950> screen

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
so the area at the bottom of the screen

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.010 
so the area at the bottom of the screen
here<00:01:39.430> this<00:01:39.640> is<00:01:39.850> your<00:01:40.030> touch<00:01:40.240> interface<00:01:40.720> and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
here this is your touch interface and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.930 
here this is your touch interface and
the<00:01:41.440> way<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.800> works<00:01:41.980> is<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.160> activate<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
the way that it works is to activate the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.780 
the way that it works is to activate the
touch<00:01:43.150> area<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.780> use<00:01:44.080> two<00:01:44.320> fingers<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.010> then

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
touch area you use two fingers and then

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.210 
touch area you use two fingers and then
you<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.090> swipe<00:01:46.510> through<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:47.140> features<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.770> we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
you can swipe through the features so we

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.090 
you can swipe through the features so we
got<00:01:48.490> time<00:01:48.730> one<00:01:49.060> time<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:50.280> date<00:01:51.300> cronograph

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
got time one time to date cronograph

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.190 
got time one time to date cronograph
what<00:01:54.100> was<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.340> alarm<00:01:54.670> timer<00:01:55.420> oops

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
what was that alarm timer oops

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.240 
what was that alarm timer oops
and<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.620> just<00:01:56.860> enter<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.460> into<00:01:57.580> timer<00:01:57.880> mode<00:01:59.250> so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
and I just enter it into timer mode so

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.100 
and I just enter it into timer mode so
now<00:02:00.370> I'm<00:02:00.460> setting<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.910> timer<00:02:01.150> using<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.900> same

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
now I'm setting the timer using the same

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.280 
now I'm setting the timer using the same
touch<00:02:02.350> interface<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.900> press<00:02:05.140> and

oops<00:02:12.849> that's<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.050> beep<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:15.190> we're<00:02:15.310> back

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
oops that's the beep and then we're back

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.809 
oops that's the beep and then we're back
to<00:02:15.489> time<00:02:15.819> one<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.590> interface<00:02:18.159> gets<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
to time one so the interface gets it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.979 
to time one so the interface gets it
takes<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.120> little<00:02:19.239> bit<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.510> getting<00:02:19.659> used<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
takes a little bit of getting used to

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.390 
takes a little bit of getting used to
I'm<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.469> to<00:02:20.560> lie

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
I'm not going to lie

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.580 
I'm not going to lie
additionally<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.390> find<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.900> font<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.560> little

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
additionally I find this font a little

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.920 
additionally I find this font a little
bit<00:02:24.010> distracting<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.910> know<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:25.599> supposed<00:02:25.720> to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
bit distracting I know it's supposed to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.729 
bit distracting I know it's supposed to
be<00:02:26.019> very<00:02:26.170> cool<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.690> me<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
be very cool but for me it's just a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.890 
be very cool but for me it's just a
little<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.849> bit<00:02:30.970> odd<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.750> I've<00:02:31.870> just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
little a little bit odd so I've just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.690 
little a little bit odd so I've just
activated<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.650> coronagraph<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.400> as<00:02:33.550> you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
activated the coronagraph there as you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.140 
activated the coronagraph there as you
can<00:02:33.760> see<00:02:34.440> start<00:02:35.440> stop<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.640> then<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.879> believe

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
can see start stop and then I believe

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.199 
can see start stop and then I believe
it's<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.360> press<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.780> hold<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.080> reset<00:02:38.590> again<00:02:39.209> so

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
it's a press and hold to reset again so

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's a press and hold to reset again so
you<00:02:40.480> know<00:02:40.569> overall<00:02:40.959> it's<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:41.860> definitely

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you know overall it's it's definitely

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400 
you know overall it's it's definitely
you<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.879> once<00:02:43.150> you've<00:02:43.330> once<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.930> understand

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you know once you've once you understand

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.500 
you know once you've once you understand
the<00:02:44.530> interface<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.489> not<00:02:45.700> too<00:02:45.910> hard<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.209> use

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the interface it's not too hard to use

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.479 
the interface it's not too hard to use
what<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.680> do<00:02:47.799> now<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.129> show<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.370> a

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
what I'm going to do now is show you a

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.220 
what I'm going to do now is show you a
shot<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> dark<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.599> does<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:50.080> an

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
shot in the dark this does have an

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.050 
shot in the dark this does have an
internal<00:02:50.560> backlight<00:02:51.099> which<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.489> activated<00:02:51.879> by

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
internal backlight which is activated by

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.729 
internal backlight which is activated by
two<00:02:52.209> fingers<00:02:52.750> pressing<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.829> holding<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:55.739> so

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
two fingers pressing and holding here so

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.330 
two fingers pressing and holding here so
there<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.040> can<00:02:57.069> see<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.459> backlight

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
there you can see the backlight

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.220 
there you can see the backlight
there<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.810> that's<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
there you go so that's what the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.470 
there you go so that's what the
backlight<00:03:01.680> looks<00:03:01.980> like<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.760> actually<00:03:03.090> very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
backlight looks like it's actually very

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.320 
backlight looks like it's actually very
bright<00:03:03.840> easy<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.709> read<00:03:04.980> with<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.819> exception

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
bright easy to read with the exception

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
bright easy to read with the exception
of<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> fact<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> font<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:07.800> hard

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
of the fact that that font is just hard

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.640 
of the fact that that font is just hard
to<00:03:08.069> read<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.000> does<00:03:09.750> well<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> dark<00:03:10.440> for

overall what are my impressions of this

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
overall what are my impressions of this
watch<00:03:14.910> well<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.630> think<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:16.020> important<00:03:16.440> to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
watch well I think it's important to
