00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.369 

applied<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> deep<00:00:41.969> sage<00:00:42.329> green<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> color<00:00:43.110> in

applied this deep sage green a color in

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860

a<00:00:43.469> v-shape<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> outer<00:00:44.700> corner<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.450> lid

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
a v-shape to the outer corner of my lid

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
a v-shape to the outer corner of my lid
I<00:00:46.110> knew<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> wear<00:00:47.399> red<00:00:47.670> lipstick

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
I knew I was going to wear red lipstick

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
I knew I was going to wear red lipstick
so<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> didn't<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.170> too<00:00:49.230> heavy<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so I didn't want to go too heavy but I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
so I didn't want to go too heavy but I
did<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.170> than<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
did want to do a little more than I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
did want to do a little more than I
typically<00:00:52.829> wear<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.850> also<00:01:00.059> apply<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
typically wear and then I also apply the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
typically wear and then I also apply the
same<00:01:00.930> color<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> outer<00:01:01.890> corner<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> my

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
same color on the outer corner of my

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.580 
same color on the outer corner of my
lower<00:01:02.789> lash<00:01:03.270> line<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:05.689> use<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.900> favorite<00:01:07.290> liquid

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lower lash line I use my favorite liquid

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
lower lash line I use my favorite liquid
liner<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:08.040> zuzu<00:01:08.520> luxe<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.869> apply<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
liner from zuzu luxe and just apply this

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160

to<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.280> top<00:01:11.520> lash<00:01:11.850> line<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> probably

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to my top lash line and this is probably

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
to my top lash line and this is probably
the<00:01:13.530> most<00:01:14.159> difficult<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.720> camera

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the most difficult thing to do on camera

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
the most difficult thing to do on camera
and<00:01:16.590> stay<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> focus<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.970> never<00:01:18.299> seem<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> do

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and stay in focus I can never seem to do

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.710 
and stay in focus I can never seem to do
this<00:01:19.290> right

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.050 

and<00:01:26.810> after<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.950> curled<00:01:28.250> my<00:01:28.310> lashes<00:01:28.400> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and after that I curled my lashes and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:42.280 
and after that I curled my lashes and
applied<00:01:29.750> my<00:01:29.990> mascara<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:41.450> highlight<00:01:41.810> under<00:01:42.110> my

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.660 
brow I use this off white color this is
a<00:01:44.480> mineral<00:01:44.750> shadow<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.620> has<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:46.070> little<00:01:46.490> bit

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
a mineral shadow so it has a little bit

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a mineral shadow so it has a little bit
of<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.880> sheen<00:01:47.150> but<00:01:47.330> not<00:01:47.630> too<00:01:47.870> much<00:01:47.900> shimmer<00:01:48.350> I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
of a sheen but not too much shimmer I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.510 
of a sheen but not too much shimmer I
used<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.050> bronzer<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.770> contour<00:01:51.800> so<00:01:52.490> I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
used in this bronzer to contour so I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.670 
used in this bronzer to contour so I
applied<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.940> along<00:01:53.660> with<00:01:53.750> my<00:01:53.840> temples<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
applied it along with my temples and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.470 
applied it along with my temples and
then<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.100> little<00:01:55.220> underneath<00:01:55.820> my<00:01:56.000> cheek<00:01:56.270> bone

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
then a little underneath my cheek bone

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.930 
then a little underneath my cheek bone
and<00:01:56.780> along<00:01:57.050> my<00:01:57.080> jawline<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.770> onto<00:01:58.310> my<00:01:58.430> neck<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
and along my jawline and onto my neck I

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.180 
and along my jawline and onto my neck I
really<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.170> bronzer<00:02:00.650> because<00:02:00.830> it's

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
really like this bronzer because it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.550 
really like this bronzer because it's
not<00:02:01.400> too<00:02:01.880> shimmery<00:02:02.180> although<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> does<00:02:03.080> have<00:02:03.110> a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
not too shimmery although it does have a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.520 
not too shimmery although it does have a
tiny<00:02:04.130> bit<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.790> light<00:02:05.510> reflecting<00:02:06.050> particles

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
tiny bit of light reflecting particles

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.080 
tiny bit of light reflecting particles
it's<00:02:06.740> not<00:02:06.950> something<00:02:07.460> that's<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.000> make

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
it's not something that's going to make

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.400 
it's not something that's going to make
you<00:02:08.240> look<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.510> you<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.899> glitter<00:02:09.140> all<00:02:09.229> over

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
you look like you have glitter all over

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.520 
you look like you have glitter all over
your<00:02:09.770> face<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.310> I'm<00:02:10.790> sure<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.600> are<00:02:11.630> all<00:02:12.050> sick

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
your face and I'm sure you are all sick

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
your face and I'm sure you are all sick

around the wand and only had to hold it
there<00:03:47.890> for<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.250> few<00:03:48.490> seconds<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.270> good<00:03:49.450> thing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
there for a few seconds the good thing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.940 
there for a few seconds the good thing
about<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.560> heats<00:03:50.770> up

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
about this one is that it heats up

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.460 
about this one is that it heats up
really<00:03:51.400> fast<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.090> stays<00:03:52.450> hot<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.200> you

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
really fast and it stays hot so you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.200 
really fast and it stays hot so you
don't<00:03:53.890> really<00:03:53.980> have<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.250> hold<00:03:54.580> your<00:03:54.760> hair<00:03:55.150> on

don't really have to hold your hair on
it<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.660> really<00:03:55.870> long<00:03:55.960> time<00:03:56.140> which<00:03:56.560> helps<00:03:57.190> a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
it for a really long time which helps a
