this<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.860> indeed<00:02:27.190> an<00:02:28.320> issue<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.950> you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
this is indeed an issue I think in you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.069 
this is indeed an issue I think in you
know<00:02:30.160> surface<00:02:30.610> right<00:02:30.850> now<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
know surface right now because the

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.410 
know surface right now because the
generation<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.739> breakdown<00:02:33.130> districts<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:34.120> few

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
generation of breakdown districts a few

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840 
generation of breakdown districts a few
decades<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.620> maybe<00:02:35.920> by<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> time<00:02:36.579> they<00:02:36.700> wish

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
decades so maybe by the time they wish
