00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
chamomile all kinds of good stuff none

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.120 
chamomile all kinds of good stuff none
of<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:37.000> would<00:00:37.630> otherwise<00:00:37.930> be<00:00:38.320> safe<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.590> use

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.099 

real<00:00:42.130> quick<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:46.449> henna<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.929> it's

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
real quick so this is the henna and it's

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.849 
real quick so this is the henna and it's
not<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:49.329> dark<00:00:49.839> on<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.170> top<00:00:50.379> but<00:00:50.620> you<00:00:50.739> can

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
not really dark on the top but you can

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.200 
not really dark on the top but you can
tell<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.039> there's<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.399> clear<00:00:51.820> color

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
tell that there's a clear color

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.610 
tell that there's a clear color
difference<00:00:52.629> there<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.199> safe<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.530> go

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
difference there so it's safe to go

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.459 
difference there so it's safe to go
ahead<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.160> start<00:00:54.789> using<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.239> for<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.230> it

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
ahead and start using it for that it

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.709 
ahead and start using it for that it
probably<00:00:56.649> would<00:00:56.949> be<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.370> more<00:00:57.760> drastic<00:00:58.359> color

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
probably would be a more drastic color

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.919 
probably would be a more drastic color
difference<00:00:59.079> if<00:00:59.320> we<00:01:00.010> were<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.699> little<00:01:01.600> bit

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
difference if we were a little bit

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.540 
difference if we were a little bit
warmer<00:01:02.289> it's<00:01:02.469> still<00:01:02.679> pretty<00:01:02.859> cold<00:01:03.039> here<00:01:03.339> we

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
warmer it's still pretty cold here we

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.799 
warmer it's still pretty cold here we

awesome but I'm to use in my hand and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.300 
awesome but I'm to use in my hand and
squishing<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.150> up<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.660> kind<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.310> muddy

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
squishing it up it's kind of this muddy

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.040 
squishing it up it's kind of this muddy
sticky<00:05:04.030> pasty<00:05:05.730> but<00:05:06.730> its<00:05:06.910> wishes<00:05:07.450> really<00:05:07.900> easy

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
sticky pasty but its wishes really easy

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.360 
sticky pasty but its wishes really easy
too<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.480> don't<00:05:11.380> like<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.590> little<00:05:11.800> kid<00:05:12.010> making

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
too so I don't like a little kid making

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.320 
too so I don't like a little kid making
mud<00:05:12.550> pies<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:13.000> guess<00:05:14.820> it's<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.880> fun<00:05:16.060> experiment

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
mud pies I guess it's a fun experiment

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.030 
mud pies I guess it's a fun experiment
it<00:05:16.630> smells<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.140> lot<00:05:17.260> better<00:05:17.320> running<00:05:17.770> about<00:05:17.950> the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
it smells a lot better running about the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.810 
it smells a lot better running about the
tea<00:05:18.190> in<00:05:18.310> there<00:05:20.160> does<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.220> make<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.490> smuggle

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
tea in there does it make the smuggle

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.340 
tea in there does it make the smuggle
away<00:05:22.000> but<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.270> kind<00:05:22.420> of<00:05:22.450> neutralizes<00:05:23.050> it<00:05:23.200> and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
away but it kind of neutralizes it and

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.090 
away but it kind of neutralizes it and
I'm<00:05:23.440> getting<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.780> my<00:05:25.930> arm<00:05:26.260> yeah<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.920> don't

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
I'm getting this on my arm yeah I don't

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.670 
I'm getting this on my arm yeah I don't
know<00:05:27.190> if<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.400> can<00:05:27.520> see<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:28.290> I'm<00:05:29.290> gonna<00:05:29.440> wipe

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
know if you can see that I'm gonna wipe

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.390 
know if you can see that I'm gonna wipe
that<00:05:29.710> out<00:05:30.130> so<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.370> don't<00:05:30.580> know<00:05:31.920> swatches<00:05:32.920> on<00:05:33.220> me

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
that out so I don't know swatches on me

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:44.110 
that out so I don't know swatches on me
which<00:05:33.730> would<00:05:34.030> be<00:05:34.150> real<00:05:34.390> fun

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.110 

that's<00:05:45.120> actually<00:05:45.600> very<00:05:45.840> very<00:05:48.350> promising

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
that's actually very very promising

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.460 
that's actually very very promising
barely<00:05:51.120> on<00:05:51.270> my<00:05:51.420> hand<00:05:51.630> for<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> teeny<00:05:52.260> tiny

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
barely on my hand for a teeny tiny

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.690 
barely on my hand for a teeny tiny
brother<00:05:52.770> don't<00:05:52.920> know<00:05:53.010> if<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.160> can<00:05:53.310> see<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.580> but

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
brother don't know if you can see it but

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.240 
brother don't know if you can see it but
there's<00:05:53.880> a<00:05:53.970> tiny<00:05:54.270> bit<00:05:54.450> of<00:05:54.570> arms<00:05:54.960> already<00:05:55.250> right

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
there's a tiny bit of arms already right

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.120 
there's a tiny bit of arms already right
there<00:05:56.430> just<00:05:56.610> from<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:56.910> sitting<00:05:57.150> on<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.450> skin

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
there just from it sitting on the skin

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.220 
there just from it sitting on the skin
so<00:05:59.130> that<00:05:59.160> tells<00:05:59.580> me<00:05:59.820> that<00:05:59.850> it's<00:06:00.150> pretty<00:06:01.140> well

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
so that tells me that it's pretty well

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.150 
so that tells me that it's pretty well
done<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:03.360> I<00:06:03.480> think<00:06:03.990> I'm<00:06:04.530> gonna<00:06:04.740> leave<00:06:04.920> the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
done and I think I'm gonna leave the

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.610 
done and I think I'm gonna leave the
consistency<00:06:05.850> at<00:06:06.000> this<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.600> if<00:06:07.110> I'm<00:06:07.320> putting

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
consistency at this and if I'm putting

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.910 
consistency at this and if I'm putting
it<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:07.770> and<00:06:08.010> I<00:06:08.070> find<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.460> need<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.770> be<00:06:10.890> a

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
it on and I find that I need it to be a

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.160 
it on and I find that I need it to be a
little<00:06:11.130> thinner<00:06:11.420> I'll<00:06:12.420> go<00:06:12.540> ahead<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.840> add<00:06:12.990> the

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
little thinner I'll go ahead and add the

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.390 
little thinner I'll go ahead and add the
rest<00:06:13.260> of<00:06:13.410> that<00:06:13.500> otherwise<00:06:13.980> I'll<00:06:14.130> just<00:06:14.190> have

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
rest of that otherwise I'll just have

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:31.130 
rest of that otherwise I'll just have
some<00:06:14.430> day<00:06:14.670> drinking<00:06:19.400> and<00:06:28.430> because<00:06:30.050> well<00:06:31.050> this

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210
