to work on because some of the parts are

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.870 
to work on because some of the parts are
small<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.499> don't<00:00:19.529> bounce<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.249> easy<00:00:20.519> on<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
gasoline vapors and the other thing is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
gasoline vapors and the other thing is
to<00:00:31.019> take<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.230> lot<00:00:31.499> of<00:00:31.529> pictures<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
can get it back together exactly how it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.770 
can get it back together exactly how it
came<00:00:35.820> apart<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.960> want<00:00:37.109> to<00:00:37.199> take<00:00:37.350> notes<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
came apart so you want to take notes of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.709 
came apart so you want to take notes of
what<00:00:39.780> came<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.649> hole<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:41.539> you<00:00:42.539> want

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to try to minimally disassemble it so if

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
to try to minimally disassemble it so if
you<00:00:45.179> have<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.359> choice<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.899> removing<00:00:46.829> only<00:00:47.129> one

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
other end we can just turn it until it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
other end we can just turn it until it
comes<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.410> set<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.190> up<00:01:29.280> next<00:01:29.550> we<00:01:29.670> take<00:01:29.820> off

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
screws out and all we have to do now is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.210 
screws out and all we have to do now is
you<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> take<00:01:55.140> apart<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> linkage<00:01:56.010> we

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you have to take apart the linkage we

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.820 
you have to take apart the linkage we
have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> take<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.240> linkage<00:01:57.660> out<00:01:57.870> and<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
have to take this linkage out and this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.530 
have to take this linkage out and this
linkage<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.490> both<00:01:59.820> part<00:02:00.120> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.300> choke

rubber o-ring and it's a it's a little

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.649 
rubber o-ring and it's a it's a little
bit<00:04:55.800> messed<00:04:56.310> up<00:04:56.550> here<00:04:56.879> it's<00:04:57.150> not<00:04:57.270> supposed<00:04:57.569> to

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
bit messed up here it's not supposed to

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.659 
bit messed up here it's not supposed to
look<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.219> mean<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.460> could<00:04:59.639> be

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
look like that so I mean that could be

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.100 
look like that so I mean that could be
part<00:04:59.969> of<00:05:00.029> the<00:05:00.120> reason<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.569> this<00:05:00.719> wasn't

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
part of the reason that this wasn't

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.570 
part of the reason that this wasn't
running<00:05:01.379> so<00:05:01.560> well<00:05:01.740> now<00:05:02.069> we're<00:05:02.159> going<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.310> take

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
running so well now we're going to take
