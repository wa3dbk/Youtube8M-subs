00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this way is really not easy for

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
this way is really not easy for
everybody<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.719> wide

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

hips like I don't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
hips like I don't
it's<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.630> hard<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.229> mean<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.310> he

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
it's really hard I mean you do it but he

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's really hard I mean you do it but he
just<00:02:02.610> won't<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.880> able<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.869> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just won't be able to see it and if you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.660 
just won't be able to see it and if you
can't<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
can't see it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.789 
can't see it
like<00:02:04.909> what's<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.180> point<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.600> do<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.930> right<00:02:06.080> so

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
like what's the point to do it right so

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.850 
like what's the point to do it right so
um<00:02:07.250> trying<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.450> might<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:08.720> be<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.709> best

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
um trying it you might not be the best

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.589 
um trying it you might not be the best
move<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.190> your<00:02:10.429> body<00:02:10.640> type<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:11.420> not

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
move for your body type and if it's not

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.510 
move for your body type and if it's not
you<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:12.020> just<00:02:12.260> don't<00:02:12.349> worry<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.280> just

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you know just don't worry so you just

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.380 
you know just don't worry so you just
hold<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.060> from<00:02:14.209> here<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:16.060> gonna<00:02:17.060> try<00:02:17.330> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
hold it from here and then gonna try to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.180 
hold it from here and then gonna try to
bring<00:02:17.660> your<00:02:17.900> hip<00:02:18.739> from<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.680> down<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
bring your hip from here and down it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.830 
bring your hip from here and down it
really<00:02:22.370> helps<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.910> bend<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.239> knee<00:02:23.390> here<00:02:23.569> just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
really helps to bend the knee here just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.229 
really helps to bend the knee here just
slightly<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:24.739> if<00:02:25.130> you're<00:02:25.340> extended<00:02:26.090> like

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
slightly because if you're extended like

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.390 
slightly because if you're extended like
that<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.720> really<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.350> stretch<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> hip

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that it's really to stretch for the hip

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.809 
that it's really to stretch for the hip
to<00:02:29.030> create<00:02:29.450> any<00:02:29.870> motion<00:02:30.500> okay<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.489> bring<00:02:31.670> your

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
to create any motion okay so bring your

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.940 
to create any motion okay so bring your
knee<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.150> slightly<00:02:32.269> from<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.989> bend<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.739> just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
knee just slightly from you bend it just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.770 
knee just slightly from you bend it just
slightly<00:02:34.130> like<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.030> then<00:02:35.209> try<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> kind

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
slightly like that and then try to kind

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.890 
slightly like that and then try to kind
of<00:02:35.900> bring<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.440> down<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.940> then<00:02:38.420> up<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
of bring it down and in and then up and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.270 
of bring it down and in and then up and
down<00:02:39.019> down<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.239> down<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.130> more

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
down down and up and down so it's more

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.680 
down down and up and down so it's more
like<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> circle<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.120> goes<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:44.510> way<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:47.630> you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
like a circle it goes this way so you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.930 
like a circle it goes this way so you
can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.350> me<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:48.769> really<00:02:49.040> small<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.819> it's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
can see on me it's really small so it's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.550 
can see on me it's really small so it's
definitely<00:02:50.330> not<00:02:50.480> favorite<00:02:51.110> move<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.530> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
definitely not favorite move that I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.430 
definitely not favorite move that I
would<00:02:51.769> ever<00:02:51.950> do<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.630> work<00:02:53.870> but<00:02:54.080> if<00:02:54.260> you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
would ever do do it for work but if you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.990 
would ever do do it for work but if you
have<00:02:54.590> white<00:02:54.830> hips<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.489> might<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.819> well

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
have white hips you might be well

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
have white hips you might be well
rocketed<00:02:56.450> smooth<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.769> look<00:02:57.860> at<00:02:58.010> yourself

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
rocketed smooth to just look at yourself

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.440 
rocketed smooth to just look at yourself
in<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.430> mirror<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:58.850> how<00:02:58.970> do<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.269> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
in the mirror so how do you like the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.470 
in the mirror so how do you like the
movement<00:02:59.780> if<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.900> like<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> um<00:03:01.549> let's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
movement if you like it do it um let's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240 
movement if you like it do it um let's
see<00:03:02.690> another<00:03:03.049> move<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.830> from<00:03:04.010> here<00:03:04.190> is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
see another move you can do from here is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.059 
see another move you can do from here is
a<00:03:04.400> simple<00:03:04.940> Anjali<00:03:05.510> ssin<00:03:05.780> okay<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.860> can

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
a simple Anjali ssin okay so you can

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.990 
a simple Anjali ssin okay so you can
hold<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:08.829> like<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:10.549> kind<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.820> just

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
hold it like that and then kind of just

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.949 
hold it like that and then kind of just
kind<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.209> rock<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:14.079> back<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.140> forth<00:03:15.410> like<00:03:16.959> that

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
kind of rock it back and forth like that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.800 
kind of rock it back and forth like that
it's<00:03:18.890> again<00:03:19.670> hard<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.209> you're<00:03:20.510> totally

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
it's again hard because you're totally

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.920 
it's again hard because you're totally
stretched<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.850> body<00:03:23.060> can't<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.780> it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
stretched and the body can't and it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.500 
stretched and the body can't and it
really<00:03:24.079> easily<00:03:24.560> when<00:03:24.709> it's<00:03:24.890> stretched<00:03:25.220> um<00:03:26.150> but

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
really easily when it's stretched um but

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.210 
really easily when it's stretched um but
it's<00:03:26.630> something<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:26.989> do<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.320> for<00:03:27.500> you

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
it's something you can do it for you

it's something you can do it for you
know<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.579> couple<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.299> counts<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.470> four<00:03:30.890> or<00:03:31.340> maybe

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
know a couple of counts of four or maybe

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.099 
know a couple of counts of four or maybe
a<00:03:31.640> couple<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.970> counts<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.390> eights<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:32.930> you

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
a couple of counts of eights if you

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.099 
a couple of counts of eights if you
can't<00:03:33.350> hold<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.590> longer<00:03:34.600> let's<00:03:35.600> see<00:03:35.870> what

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
can't hold that longer let's see what

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.360 
can't hold that longer let's see what
else<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.709> do<00:03:36.890> from<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.160> position

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
else can you do from that position

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.590 
else can you do from that position
trying<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.519> think<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:41.000> think<00:03:41.329> there<00:03:41.420> was<00:03:41.510> not

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
trying to think I think there was not
