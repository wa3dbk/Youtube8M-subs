00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
after or before buy some extra and put

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
after or before buy some extra and put
those<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> netting<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.560> would

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
those into the netting and they would

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.350 
those into the netting and they would
just<00:01:49.770> hang<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.210> arrange

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
just hang there and you could arrange

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
just hang there and you could arrange
the<00:01:51.869> green<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> looks<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.250> nice

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the green so it looks really nice

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.660 
the green so it looks really nice
another<00:01:54.390> idea<00:01:54.840> would<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> extreme

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
another idea would be to go to extreme

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
or a cross on the netting and because

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
or a cross on the netting and because
it's<00:02:03.030> close<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.539> house<00:02:03.840> an<00:02:04.170> extension

cord<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:05.250> easy<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:06.020> another<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.350> would

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
cord be easy to do another thing would

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.920 
cord be easy to do another thing would
be<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> turn<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.460> vertical<00:02:09.060> frame<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.899> of

them into a bird feeder and we

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.470 
them into a bird feeder and we
can<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.530> by<00:02:13.800> either<00:02:14.370> hanging<00:02:14.910> some<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
can do that by either hanging some of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240 
can do that by either hanging some of
the<00:02:15.570> OL<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> suet<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> seeds
