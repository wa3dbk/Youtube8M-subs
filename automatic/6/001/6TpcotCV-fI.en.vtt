00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 or 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.100
 The first time I came to MÃ©rida was the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.770
 theater pawn contreras 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.160
 and there I met a wonderful person 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.330
 what is violet 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.279
 Herrera and well, it helped me a lot 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.820
 to know every corner of the city and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.189
 fall in love and then thank my friend 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.189
 arming palms can not be lucky 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.850
 to record the video clip at home and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.340
 have views of progress 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.340
 I call him advice 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.910
 look from here I would like to try 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 convey to all the people who have a 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.290
 I dream you do not give up that late or 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.320
 early you can get to meet that 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.320
 dream 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.410
 in my dreams I was shooting on the beach 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.180
 of progress put a piano imagine the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.980
 that we have bundled to carry the piano 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 there loading 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.890
 I did not come this second time I did not come to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.040
 work I came on vacation because I 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.380
 I fell in love with Merida but not something to go 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
 to be so much time resting I have 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.800
 I have to do something something that cuts my 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.650
 I say a video clip and that's how 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.170
 been 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.830
 He has chosen me because he looks there is a lot 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 people who have loves in the shade 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.650
 and they can tell me because they do not know 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 how it will fall or many times have to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 hide stories that do transcend 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.760
 they step on dangerous ground then 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.760
 I have put myself in the shoes of those people 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.260
 the most fun thing about running the most 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 fun that happened to me was that because 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.230
 Running in Spain means running 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 then when the whole company of the 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.410
 producer to record the climent video 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.960
 that have been running I would run and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.960
 running is recording is like this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.490
 where I do not see you that I feel you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.299
 is very strong is of games I adore and that 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.159
 I sing to you and you are the 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.079
 What matters is that you are there from 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.819
 the beginning and I hope that with this 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.470
 third disc with the same color of a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.470
 day, let's always move forward 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.209
 there where you notice 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.209
 and I feel you why
