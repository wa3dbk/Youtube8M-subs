00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270 

this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.990> side<00:01:59.320> sensor<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.770> was<00:01:59.950> telling<00:02:00.220> you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
this is a side sensor I was telling you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.850 
this is a side sensor I was telling you
about<00:02:00.310> inside<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.540> one<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:02.260> just<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
about inside this one is just like the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.500 
about inside this one is just like the
front<00:02:03.100> sensor<00:02:03.520> but<00:02:03.730> it's<00:02:03.850> going<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.210> only

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
front sensor but it's going to only

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.970 
front sensor but it's going to only
monitor<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.170> things<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> right<00:02:05.740> hand

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
side this one goes out to about a 15

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.950 
side this one goes out to about a 15
degree<00:02:08.470> angle<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.220> pretty<00:02:10.090> much<00:02:10.300> not<00:02:10.780> all<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
degree angle so pretty much not all the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.060 
degree angle so pretty much not all the
way<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> front<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.560> truck<00:02:11.800> now<00:02:12.010> the
