with AC 20s I know that's a bill that's
been<00:00:24.420> floating<00:00:24.630> around<00:00:25.340> sjr<00:00:26.340> has<00:00:26.640> spawned

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
been floating around sjr has spawned

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.109 
been floating around sjr has spawned
high<00:00:27.510> side<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.949> will<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.369> moving<00:00:29.670> take

to shadow to Black Jacks and the rest
are<00:01:07.770> shadow<00:01:08.010> box<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.299> looks<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.810> sjr<00:01:10.500> has

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

are shadow box so it looks like sjr has
in<00:01:10.860> fact<00:01:11.010> ditched<00:01:11.760> their<00:01:12.119> point<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.570> have

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
in fact ditched their point they have

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
in fact ditched their point they have
not<00:01:13.020> capped<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> yet<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.580> moving

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
not capped as of yet and are moving

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.170 
not capped as of yet and are moving
forward<00:01:15.560> across<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.369> drop<00:01:17.610> ship<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.000> fast

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
forward across the drop ship as fast

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
forward across the drop ship as fast
they<00:01:18.450> possibly<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.500> also<00:01:19.650> see

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
they possibly can but we also see

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
they possibly can but we also see
Russian<00:01:20.250> clan<00:01:20.490> wolf<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.909> moving<00:01:21.270> below<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
Russian clan wolf is moving below the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.300 
Russian clan wolf is moving below the
dropship<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
dropship so we're going to see a little

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.690 
dropship so we're going to see a little
bit<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:24.180> circular<00:01:24.540> push<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:26.340> think

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
bit of a circular push here I do think

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.580 
bit of a circular push here I do think
that<00:01:26.790> sjr<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.420> probably<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.140> faster

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that sjr is probably going to be faster

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
that sjr is probably going to be faster
in<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.860> engagement<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.520> able<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> take

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in this engagement they are able to take

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
in this engagement they are able to take
the<00:01:30.150> tighter<00:01:30.479> line<00:01:30.840> due<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.799> drop<00:01:32.040> ship

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the tighter line due to this drop ship

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
the tighter line due to this drop ship
but<00:01:32.670> those<00:01:32.820> catapult<00:01:33.270> k2s<00:01:33.659> are<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.320> slower

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
but those catapult k2s are a lot slower

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
but those catapult k2s are a lot slower
and<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.600> catapults

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and we do see one of those catapults

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.300 
and we do see one of those catapults
k2's<00:01:37.290> getting<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.860> bit<00:01:38.070> left<00:01:38.250> behind<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310

to avoid striking the other we see this

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.090 
to avoid striking the other we see this
k2<00:02:31.030> however<00:02:31.540> does<00:02:31.840> get<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.350> strike<00:02:32.620> dropped<00:02:32.890> on

clan wolf a good game they had a good

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.860 
clan wolf a good game they had a good
push<00:03:10.030> they<00:03:10.420> tried<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:11.320> those<00:03:12.870> catapults

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.140

while<00:03:14.170> they<00:03:14.290> were<00:03:14.380> out<00:03:14.410> behind<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.670> they<00:03:15.850> cut

that corner I think they were a little

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.580 
that corner I think they were a little
bit<00:03:17.709> too<00:03:17.890> hasty<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.750> they<00:03:19.750> were<00:03:19.810> they<00:03:20.170> got

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
spread out as a result so we see this

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.059 

a<00:03:35.290> good<00:03:35.980> game

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.300 

we<00:03:41.670> saw<00:03:41.879> that<00:03:42.689> was<00:03:43.230> definitely<00:03:43.469> proper<00:03:44.129> focus

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
we saw that was definitely proper focus

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.550 
we saw that was definitely proper focus
fire<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.810> important<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.290> bring<00:03:46.469> down

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
fire it's really important to bring down

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.280 
fire it's really important to bring down
those<00:03:46.739> k2s<00:03:47.159> they<00:03:47.370> were<00:03:47.430> at<00:03:47.670> dual<00:03:47.879> AC<00:03:48.060> 20s<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
those k2s they were at dual AC 20s so

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.589 
those k2s they were at dual AC 20s so
they<00:03:49.799> were<00:03:49.859> putting<00:03:50.219> out<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.609> ton<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.180> damage

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
they were putting out a ton of damage

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.449 
they were putting out a ton of damage
and<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.049> have<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.379> very<00:03:52.739> careful<00:03:53.099> with

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
and you have to be very careful with

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.069 
and you have to be very careful with
them<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:54.120> i<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.480> was<00:03:54.569> definitely<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
them so i think it was definitely the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.770 
them so i think it was definitely the
right<00:03:55.230> decision<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.920> focus<00:03:56.040> them<00:03:56.370> down<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:57.359> i

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
right decision to focus them down but i

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.619 
right decision to focus them down but i
think<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.519> russian<00:03:59.519> clan<00:03:59.730> will<00:03:59.849> played<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
think that russian clan will played a

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.979 
think that russian clan will played a
little<00:04:01.170> bit<00:04:01.849> too<00:04:02.849> aggressively<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.780> trying

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
little bit too aggressively and trying

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.660 
little bit too aggressively and trying
to<00:04:04.109> get<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.469> them<00:04:04.680> they<00:04:05.129> saw<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.489> out<00:04:05.579> of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
to get to them they saw them out of

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.099 
to get to them they saw them out of
position<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.180> they<00:04:06.299> started<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.689> cut<00:04:06.870> across

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
position and they started to cut across

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.280 
position and they started to cut across
open<00:04:07.439> ground<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.950> get<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.219> them<00:04:08.370> instead<00:04:08.879> of

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
open ground to get to them instead of

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.690 
open ground to get to them instead of
completing<00:04:10.290> their<00:04:10.530> movement<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.249> sticking

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
completing their movement and sticking

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.369 
completing their movement and sticking
together<00:04:11.849> they<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.299> strung<00:04:12.629> out<00:04:12.749> and<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.169> think

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
together they got strung out and I think

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.050 
together they got strung out and I think
that's<00:04:13.560> what<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:13.919> think<00:04:14.519> that's<00:04:14.639> what<00:04:14.760> cost<00:04:14.909> in

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
that's what I think that's what cost in

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.359 
that's what I think that's what cost in
this<00:04:15.180> game
