00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
I took the essence at one point and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.270 
I took the essence at one point and
mayhem<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.080> takes<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.620> half<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.950> second

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
mayhem it takes it like half a second

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.780 
mayhem it takes it like half a second
before<00:02:19.310> me<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.740> one<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.770> us<00:02:21.950> had<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.250> die<00:02:22.400> which

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
before me so one of us had to die which

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.190 
before me so one of us had to die which
kind<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> stuff<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:25.160> mainly<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.360> clear

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
kind of stuff so but mainly it's clear

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660 
kind of stuff so but mainly it's clear
off<00:02:27.350> enemies<00:02:27.710> as<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.040> can<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.400> there's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
off enemies as you can see there's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.130 
off enemies as you can see there's
actually<00:02:29.330> no<00:02:30.200> enemies<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:31.450> which<00:02:32.450> made<00:02:32.840> our

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
actually no enemies with which made our

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.990 
actually no enemies with which made our
life<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.680> whole<00:02:33.830> lot<00:02:33.890> easier<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.700> wander

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
life a whole lot easier we can wander

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.880 
life a whole lot easier we can wander
back<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> side<00:02:35.660> since<00:02:35.960> no<00:02:36.200> loss<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
back to the side since no loss is on the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.950 
back to the side since no loss is on the
other<00:02:37.010> side<00:02:37.130> he's<00:02:38.060> got<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> wander<00:02:38.690> his<00:02:38.810> way

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
other side he's got a wander his way

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.840 
other side he's got a wander his way
back<00:02:39.230> he<00:02:39.470> usually<00:02:39.650> gets<00:02:39.920> stuck<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.640> left

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
back he usually gets stuck on the left

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.400 
back he usually gets stuck on the left
side<00:02:41.060> though<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.690> gives<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.990> plenty<00:02:42.020> of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
side though so that gives you plenty of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.400 
side though so that gives you plenty of
time<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:43.450> clear<00:02:44.450> off<00:02:44.630> enemies<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.350> are

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
time to clear off enemies that are

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.050 
time to clear off enemies that are
spawning<00:02:45.770> right<00:02:46.040> now<00:02:46.190> that's<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.850> main<00:02:47.030> thing

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
spawning right now that's the main thing

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.550 
spawning right now that's the main thing
that<00:02:47.270> we're<00:02:47.570> focused<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.050> right<00:02:48.110> now<00:02:48.320> we're

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
that we're focused on right now we're

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.010 
that we're focused on right now we're
clearing<00:02:48.860> off<00:02:49.100> enemies<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.450> when<00:02:50.600> Scola

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
clearing off enemies so that when Scola

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.170 
clearing off enemies so that when Scola
Stroh's<00:02:51.500> up<00:02:51.770> we<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.370> actually<00:02:52.580> kill<00:02:53.000> him

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
Stroh's up we can actually kill him

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.320 
Stroh's up we can actually kill him
without<00:02:53.540> having<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.140> worry<00:02:54.320> about<00:02:54.410> very<00:02:54.770> much

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
without having to worry about very much

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.810 
without having to worry about very much
so<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.870> main<00:02:57.050> thing<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.560> we<00:02:57.800> try<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.580> give<00:02:58.760> her

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
so the main thing is we try to give her

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.590 
so the main thing is we try to give her
the<00:02:58.970> snipers<00:02:59.420> first<00:02:59.660> snipers<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.600> captain's

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
the snipers first snipers and captain's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.390 
the snipers first snipers and captain's
aren't<00:03:02.810> really<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.110> hard<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:04.070> can<00:03:04.190> get<00:03:04.310> up

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
aren't really that hard they can get up

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.880 
aren't really that hard they can get up
close<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.700> not<00:03:04.970> really<00:03:05.120> bother<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.540> too<00:03:05.720> much

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
close and not really bother you too much

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.800 
close and not really bother you too much
we<00:03:06.890> had<00:03:07.040> ninja<00:03:07.370> die<00:03:07.520> right<00:03:07.880> there<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.630> he

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
we had ninja die right there so that he

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.240 
we had ninja die right there so that he
could<00:03:08.989> take<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.260> essence<00:03:09.650> because<00:03:10.070> he<00:03:10.160> has

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
could take the essence because he has

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.370 
could take the essence because he has
self<00:03:10.459> arez<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.209> was<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.780> main<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.230> big

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
self arez that was the main the big

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.340 
self arez that was the main the big
thing<00:03:12.590> about<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.140> mainly

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
thing about that but it's just mainly

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.780 
thing about that but it's just mainly
clearing<00:03:15.830> off<00:03:15.920> enemies<00:03:16.280> right<00:03:16.459> now<00:03:16.580> not<00:03:16.760> even

clearing off enemies right now not even

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.720 
clearing off enemies right now not even
worrying<00:03:17.360> about<00:03:17.540> damaging<00:03:17.630> Scola<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:18.830> not<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
worrying about damaging Scola it's not a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.090 
worrying about damaging Scola it's not a
big<00:03:20.030> deal<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.810> damn<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.290> gym<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:21.709> at<00:03:21.950> one

big deal you can damn the gym all at one

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.860 
big deal you can damn the gym all at one

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
time and get everything to happen at

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.210 
time and get everything to happen at
once<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.410> not<00:03:24.560> have<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.890> worry<00:03:24.920> about

once and not have to worry about

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.449 
once and not have to worry about
anything<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.350> here's<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.860> last<00:03:28.190> bit<00:03:28.430> of

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
anything so here's the last bit of

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.010 
anything so here's the last bit of
enemies<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.000> were<00:03:29.120> clearing<00:03:29.390> off<00:03:29.600> or

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
enemies that were clearing off or

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.340 
enemies that were clearing off or
checking<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:31.220> see<00:03:31.430> anymore<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.989> we<00:03:33.140> have<00:03:33.320> a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
checking don't see anymore so we have a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.640 
checking don't see anymore so we have a
few<00:03:33.500> minutes<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.370> damage<00:03:34.700> skolas<00:03:35.180> before<00:03:35.720> he

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
few minutes to damage skolas before he

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.930 
few minutes to damage skolas before he
does

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
does

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.390 
does
before<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.720> new<00:03:38.870> enemy<00:03:39.200> spawn<00:03:39.470> now<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.190> main

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
before the new enemy spawn now the main

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.110 
before the new enemy spawn now the main
thing<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.330> can't<00:03:41.600> damage<00:03:42.020> him<00:03:42.170> enough

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
thing is if you can't damage him enough

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.570 
thing is if you can't damage him enough
because<00:03:44.120> he<00:03:44.540> always<00:03:44.860> activates<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.280> next

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
because he always activates the next

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.020 
because he always activates the next
mines<00:03:46.820> at<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.860> quarter<00:03:48.860> health<00:03:49.400> market<00:03:49.910> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
mines at the quarter health market so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.370 
mines at the quarter health market so
let's<00:03:50.240> say<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.420> didn't<00:03:50.720> clear<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:50.960> enemies

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
let's say you didn't clear the enemies

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.960 
let's say you didn't clear the enemies
off<00:03:51.560> fast<00:03:51.830> enough<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.370> don't<00:03:52.550> want<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.820> take

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
off fast enough you don't want to take

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.720 
off fast enough you don't want to take
them<00:03:53.120> below<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.330> quarter<00:03:53.660> because<00:03:54.080> then<00:03:54.950> you're

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
them below a quarter because then you're

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.880 
them below a quarter because then you're
gonna<00:03:55.850> have<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.090> ton<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.390> enemies<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.530> you're

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
gonna have a ton of enemies and you're

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.980 
gonna have a ton of enemies and you're
gonna<00:03:57.980> have<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.220> disown<00:03:58.490> mines<00:03:58.820> which<00:03:59.240> will<00:03:59.750> be

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
gonna have to disown mines which will be

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.800 
gonna have to disown mines which will be
completely<00:04:00.770> awful<00:04:01.700> because<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.420> main<00:04:02.570> thing

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
completely awful because the main thing

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.420 
completely awful because the main thing
about<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.350> way<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:03.770> do<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.370> we

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
about the way that we do this is we

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.070 
about the way that we do this is we
don't<00:04:04.910> want<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.210> be<00:04:05.300> in<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.540> middle<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.930> the

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
don't want to be in the middle of the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.650 
don't want to be in the middle of the
map<00:04:06.230> aiming<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.710> disarm<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.280> mine<00:04:07.520> with<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.330> ton

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
map aiming to disarm of mine with a ton

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.780 
map aiming to disarm of mine with a ton
of<00:04:08.690> arch<00:04:09.080> snipers<00:04:09.620> shooting<00:04:10.040> at<00:04:10.160> us<00:04:10.310> we're

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
of arch snipers shooting at us we're

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.250 
of arch snipers shooting at us we're
just<00:04:10.850> going<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.060> instantly<00:04:11.480> die<00:04:11.660> there's<00:04:11.990> no

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
just going to instantly die there's no

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.680 
just going to instantly die there's no
reason<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.620> should<00:04:12.920> be<00:04:13.040> doing<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.690> it's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
reason you should be doing that it's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.650 
reason you should be doing that it's
just<00:04:14.960> instant<00:04:15.410> death<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.519> we<00:04:16.880> killed<00:04:17.180> skull<00:04:17.480> us

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
just instant death so we killed skull us

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.400 
just instant death so we killed skull us
um<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.980> main<00:04:19.160> thing<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.940> maybe<00:04:20.900> you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
um the main thing is if maybe you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.440 
um the main thing is if maybe you
couldn't<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.130> enough<00:04:22.250> damage<00:04:22.430> like<00:04:23.030> we<00:04:23.270> knew

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
couldn't do enough damage like we knew

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.630 
couldn't do enough damage like we knew
we<00:04:23.600> could<00:04:23.750> do<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> damage<00:04:24.200> maybe<00:04:25.190> wait

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
we could do the damage maybe wait

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.580 
we could do the damage maybe wait
another<00:04:25.910> round<00:04:26.180> clear<00:04:26.930> off<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.290> enemies

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
another round clear off the enemies

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.530 
another round clear off the enemies
again<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.190> then<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.430> can<00:04:28.580> definitely<00:04:28.850> kill

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
again and then you can definitely kill

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.330 
again and then you can definitely kill
him<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.990> next<00:04:30.260> run<00:04:30.440> take<00:04:30.890> them<00:04:31.010> down<00:04:31.160> to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
him on the next run take them down to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.210 
him on the next run take them down to
about<00:04:32.080> 3035<00:04:33.080> percent<00:04:33.860> health<00:04:34.070> easy<00:04:34.910> kill<00:04:35.360> and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
about 3035 percent health easy kill and

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.250 
about 3035 percent health easy kill and
that's<00:04:37.220> about<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:38.510> disarm<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.020> mines

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260
