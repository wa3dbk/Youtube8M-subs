00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
what he was supposed to do he was the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.089 
what he was supposed to do he was the
aggressive<00:00:12.360> fighter<00:00:12.599> he<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.920> moving

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
aggressive fighter he was the one moving

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.829 
aggressive fighter he was the one moving
forward<00:00:14.670> he<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.210> trying<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:15.719> it

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
forward he was the one trying to make it

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
forward he was the one trying to make it
a<00:00:15.900> fight<00:00:16.170> even<00:00:17.039> though<00:00:17.130> he<00:00:17.279> didn't<00:00:17.520> throw<00:00:17.730> as

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
a fight even though he didn't throw as

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.320 
a fight even though he didn't throw as
many<00:00:18.060> punches<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.630> he<00:00:18.869> would<00:00:19.020> normally<00:00:19.199> throw

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
many punches as he would normally throw

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.509 
many punches as he would normally throw
which<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> understandable<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:22.560> Shane

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
which is understandable because Shane

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.660 
which is understandable because Shane
Mosley<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.090> much<00:00:24.300> faster<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:25.460> most<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
Mosley is much faster than most of the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
Mosley is much faster than most of the
opponents<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> Pacquiao<00:00:27.810> has<00:00:27.840> been<00:00:28.140> facing

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
opponents that Pacquiao has been facing

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
opponents that Pacquiao has been facing
lately<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.789> understand<00:00:30.210> him<00:00:30.359> being<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
lately so I can understand him being a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
lately so I can understand him being a
little<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.929> more<00:00:31.019> cautious<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:32.309> his

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
little bit more cautious with his

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
little bit more cautious with his
aggression<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.020> disappointed

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
aggression but I was just disappointed

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.069 
aggression but I was just disappointed
that<00:00:34.710> Mosley<00:00:35.600> because<00:00:36.600> he<00:00:36.690> did<00:00:36.870> something

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that Mosley because he did something

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.790 
that Mosley because he did something
that<00:00:37.320> he's<00:00:37.680> never<00:00:38.160> done<00:00:38.430> before<00:00:38.579> he<00:00:39.800> fought

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that he's never done before he fought

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.970 
that he's never done before he fought
like<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> coward<00:00:41.460> basically<00:00:42.239> he<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.320> running

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
like a coward basically he was running

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.389 
like a coward basically he was running
he<00:00:44.190> wasn't<00:00:44.550> done<00:00:44.760> many<00:00:45.480> punches<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> late

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
he wasn't done many punches in the late

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.310 
he wasn't done many punches in the late
rounds<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.940> he<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.210> doing<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.570> backing<00:00:49.050> up

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.490 

no<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:52.590> didn't<00:00:52.890> Moses<00:00:53.760> didn't<00:00:53.940> even<00:00:54.500> even

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
no he didn't Moses didn't even even

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
no he didn't Moses didn't even even
really<00:00:55.710> throw<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.129> many<00:00:56.219> punches<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:59.270> what

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
really throw that many punches and what

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.139 
really throw that many punches and what
it<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.770> paki<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.489> mostly<00:01:02.879> down

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it was was when paki out not mostly down

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
it was was when paki out not mostly down
i<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> third<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.830> think

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
i think it was in a third around I think

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
i think it was in a third around I think
the<00:01:05.909> power<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.420> Pacquiao<00:01:06.869> surprised<00:01:07.409> Mosley

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the power of Pacquiao surprised Mosley

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.289 
the power of Pacquiao surprised Mosley
and<00:01:08.720> from<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> point<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.350> he<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.860> just

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
and from that point on he was just

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.660 
and from that point on he was just
trying<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.479> defensive<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.350> he<00:01:13.470> knew

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
trying to be defensive because he knew

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.670 
trying to be defensive because he knew
he<00:01:16.420> would<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.689> got<00:01:16.840> careless<00:01:17.200> he<00:01:17.470> would<00:01:17.590> have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
he would have got careless he would have

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.050 
he would have got careless he would have
just<00:01:17.770> got<00:01:17.920> knocked<00:01:18.159> down<00:01:18.310> again<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.290> that's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
just got knocked down again so that's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.830 
just got knocked down again so that's
what<00:01:22.060> caused<00:01:22.360> him<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.689> be<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:24.570> fight<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.720> way

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
what caused him to be to fight the way

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.270 
what caused him to be to fight the way
he<00:01:25.990> fought<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.500> know<00:01:26.590> not<00:01:26.740> throwing<00:01:27.130> that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
he fought you know not throwing that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
he fought you know not throwing that
many<00:01:27.460> power<00:01:27.700> punches<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
many power punches and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.870 
many power punches and
it's<00:01:32.870> just<00:01:33.140> very<00:01:33.350> strange<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.400> Mosley

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's just very strange to see Mosley

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.040 
it's just very strange to see Mosley
running<00:01:35.330> because<00:01:35.450> that's<00:01:35.690> something<00:01:35.840> I've

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
running because that's something I've

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.480 
running because that's something I've
never<00:01:36.200> seen<00:01:36.440> him<00:01:36.560> do<00:01:36.740> before<00:01:36.890> I've<00:01:37.100> never<00:01:37.250> seen

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
never seen him do before I've never seen

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.410 
never seen him do before I've never seen
him<00:01:37.610> run<00:01:38.020> like<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.080> before<00:01:39.550> even<00:01:40.550> when<00:01:41.180> he's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
him run like that before even when he's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.610 
him run like that before even when he's
losing<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> fight<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.350> know<00:01:42.440> he's<00:01:42.590> still

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
losing the fight you know he's still

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.420 
losing the fight you know he's still
trying<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.310> win<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.740> he<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:45.980> knew

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
trying to win but it's like he just knew

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.890 
trying to win but it's like he just knew
that<00:01:46.490> he<00:01:46.730> couldn't<00:01:47.000> win<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.540> he<00:01:47.630> was<00:01:47.750> just

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
but I was just disappointed because

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.890 
but I was just disappointed because
Mosley<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.290> known<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.710> warrior<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.900> he

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
tonight and I thought that Mosley was

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.020 
tonight and I thought that Mosley was
going<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.680> take<00:02:21.830> more<00:02:22.040> chances<00:02:22.100> than<00:02:22.610> what<00:02:22.940> he

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030
