00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi friends this is nikolai today we 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 you remember all kinds of busting 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 we walked with you for him like for everyone 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 the device is a separate lesson where we 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 dismantled in detail 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 well now i would like to have one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 collect all videos about everything about them 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
 tell a little bit and you play it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 see you may future several times 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 review to remember which ones 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 there are types of search and maybe together 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 repeat with me so first bust 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.960
 which is the easiest one we've learned 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.300
 it's bust 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.560
 four four because 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.280
 accordingly there are four movements 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.070
 here is a responsibly good song for that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.490
 to use this brute force 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.050
 any rnb song or any rap well 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.840
 we have our domestic rap 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.150
 why take someone else's 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.200
 black boomer black boomer waiting 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.920
 signal lights black boomer black 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.750
 boomer 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 if you want to catch it, that is very 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.400
 short bust it is played often 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.800
 similar compositions are still chords 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.200
 time to all the songs on my site on 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.430
 Feather Leskom my site go to there 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.050
 free all chords which 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.150
 show they are there to all the song 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.850
 farther next bust which we 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.200
 examined whether this Six Seven 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.200
 which accordingly sounds like this 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.000
 This six and accordingly played 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.520
 on her on such a classic 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.940
 composition of the Soviet school of play on 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 guitar 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:47.900
 this is a grape seed in warm earth 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.470
 I will kill the vine and fresh game 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.470
 I'll rip 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.760
 yes this six is â€‹â€‹perfect perfect 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.590
 bust for such classic 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.430
 the next bust it was 1 pinch 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.440
 translation yes if God forbid you 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 someday find yourself in places not so 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.700
 remote brittle suited to the song escape 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340
 from prison I'll somehow tell you how 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.180
 choose so here thug brute course 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.720
 same most classic song here it is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:28.550
 stop the engine do not knock the wheels 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.060
 jig brakes 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:39.000
 I was sucked dangerous sucked to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.270
 absolutely beautiful song and now 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.300
 burchenko played and comic stuff and 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.880
 chastushki total 1000 bust it 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.800
 waltz waltz bust which is your 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 because the same thug but 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.880
 only 2 times more 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.040
 test we have two moves by the way someone 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.769
 unfairly wrote a comment what 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.769
 waltz not two accounts 3 on 1 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.440
 avatar thank you very much for the comment and 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:10.690
 so busting waltz is bard 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.739
 songs in the first part of the ski stand 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.739
 the sunset goes out behind the mountain 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.710
 and many such children's songs are played 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.400
 this bust well and probably including 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.740
 something more rocker can come up 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.630
 find but mostly of course it's some 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.760
 more such classic bard 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.460
 songs next bust I call 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.920
 four pinch and separate video about 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.250
 he did not do what he seems to me 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 too either 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.620
 so ordinary and not many songs to them 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.300
 It is rather an authoring thing. 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.490
 when you teach that song again you can 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.530
 this brute force is sometimes used but 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.830
 comes down to what you usually do 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.770
 bass string sweat forefinger 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:00.370
 finger jerks third and at the same time 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.370
 tugging 2 lower turns here 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.380
 all this is also a foursome only jaw 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.569
 roughly 22 even probably troika 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.989
 given windows only four are valid 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.640
 strings 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.640
 but so triple 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.650
 even 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.370
 what is the song a break to play 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.630
 can and generally use it before 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 next brute force which we studied 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.010
 last last tutorial is the eight 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.010
 eight that sounds like this 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.090
 respectively, eight give I show 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.020
 the same difficult bust i have slowly 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.020
 I'll show you one more time 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.110
 such a search, respectively, my 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.110
 favorite composition in this regard is 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.389
 last time last clear 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.710
 province dawn last opportunity 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.660
 clans 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.280
 this search is best suited 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.660
 just for such lyric songs well 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.660
 last lesson showed what songs we 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.300
 play a very large amount of vitamin 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.970
 smoking is the most difficult 1 i would call 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.100
 the most popular search because in 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.560
 In general, it seems that people who write songs 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.940
 I want to do something difficult here 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.900
 they are used from brute force but 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.900
 really beautiful 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.240
 most to this sonorous 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.720
 next brute so we also don't 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.770
 he looked like I don't have it 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.610
 the name is probably a mixture again 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.310
 plucked brute force 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.810
 and some eight sixes then 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.190
 what do you do to play 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.830
 bust you jerk at the same time bass 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.800
 string and bottom absolutely any bass 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:02.580
 the string you pull simultaneously from the bottom 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:02.580
 that is what it is 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.450
 try to train well early or 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.870
 late you will start to discover 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.350
 a wide variety of busting and you 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.580
 learn to play some sorting 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.550
 atypical who we are you only play 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.540
 for example, you gradually practice it 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.920
 how would you give freedom in this regard 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.560
 well friends for the next video we 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.660
 already we move on to a new chapter, a new chapter 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.270
 torment can say this was a course 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.350
 which is dedicated brute well brute we 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.160
 we will probably return again so 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.350
 I would like you to succeed 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.780
 please write me your difficulties 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.170
 your problems leave comments 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.170
 requests for some videos I will try 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:01.530
 explain mistakes explain if something 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.800
 I can't do it and show you the songs 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.350
 who do you want to learn to play 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.840
 we will do it leisurely in detail 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.830
 I hope everyone can figure it out 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.780
 well with you was nikolai
