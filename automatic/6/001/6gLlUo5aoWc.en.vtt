00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.589
 [Music] 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.630
 Hello and welcome to the channel expansion my 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.210
 name is I could do it myself 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.799
 A top 8 of the war is a video game 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.799
 insert at 2 into the net 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 Hill switch switch is from the soviet 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 gaming company and it originated in 1989 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.510
 this play is so to speak 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 horror game and at the beginning of the game 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 You can choose if you want a small one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.359
 Girl plays or an invisible one 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 demon most of the people have become 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.390
 the girl taken 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.250
 because you can not control the demo because 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.200
 he is invisible and the game really 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 It is difficult in the game is difficult 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 if one tries with the demon the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 play through clears the whole 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 play all the game scores from the device like that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 it is in principle not detectable 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.660
 and it's still a mystery why 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 Unfortunately this game happened 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 only between five and ten thousand times 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 that's what this is selling in the world 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.949
 game is basically not right at all 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 existence and in 2005 a japanese had 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.170
 decided this game on ebay for 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 say simon 55,000 dollars 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.449
 to buy 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 He wanted to play with the demon and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.689
 wanted to document that then by video 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 and only one video came out 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.820
 and how this Japanese started 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.590
 had to cry in front of the screen 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.570
 Criticism of others could be final fantasy 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.810
 8 still know here is the theory 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 that scroller is the main character of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 story she objected eight dead be this 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.470
 Game is divided into several discs 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.600
 and at the end of the first disc you fight 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 against an endboss and in the second 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.590
 disc wakes the character quasi without 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 sore as we did not have 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.720
 fought the awesome game is that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.850
 Play it pretty much until the first one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 Realistic from the second discreet 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 this realism out of the window 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 the game becomes so illogical one fights 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 partly in space and everything is 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.880
 just surreal 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 you have to ask yourself as a user 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.299
 the character may already have died 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.920
 and the whole thing plays after the first one 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.930
 list still in his head while he is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 just crashes is already full in principle 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.939
 dead 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.439
 you do not know you have the game 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.030
 played mini comments that played 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.009
 it's really a thing this time 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.439
 lavender 1000 syndrome there is a city 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.299
 in pokémon the lavender town is called and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.450
 the glaring story is that 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.250
 just this music 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.590
 in the background runs in the client 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.569
 pretty weird and strangers what it is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.940
 happened to have children in japan 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.950
 row after row committed suicide 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.349
 Imagine kids committing 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.450
 suicide because of a music in one 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.489
 pokémon game then they had that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.099
 so censor that of course 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.709
 no longer occurs I think that is 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.750
 mega sick you know the game fallout 3 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.910
 it is said that the game is full of 3 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.860
 predict the future and provide in the future 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.930
 game is about a post galactic 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.610
 sorry where in principle a figure speci 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.230
 escaped the nuclear war and the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.030
 whole world is destroyed and now there 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.620
 there are still a few people who are there 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 somehow survived in the underground 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 There are radio stations under the game 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.319
 send the messages and that are 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.730
 pretty critical you are very different 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.079
 can interpret there then comes 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.670
 a sentence like that is unbelievable that 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.829
 Britney won an Oscar today 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.079
 following with the sorse a date 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.090
 predict or the queen has died 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.709
 Follow with a date because of that 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.019
 the people that a radiostation in that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.599
 Game gives the future in predicting 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.310
 the reality 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.569
 now it is about the game more often and in 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.040
 There is a villain of the game 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.230
 highspeed gas and then we go back to 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.150
 past where the gas is even weaker 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.799
 is to defeat him there with you 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810
 again in the future not from them 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.090
 running is the glaring of the story 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.730
 only one fights in the past 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 At least that's what you suspect against gigas 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.470
 as a fetus as a non-born baby man 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 defeated him by calling him in principle 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.250
 we abort we make the game has one 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.560
 Statement given and my tip 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.299
 this end or fight 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.220
 he took a look at a movie of the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.230
 had traumatized him then 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.370
 what on the one hand awesome and very creative 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.989
 on the other hand like perfect mallorcas 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.630
 Mask and that's right again 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 creepy you had a user in a forum 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.079
 written that they are playing this game 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.880
 had purchased and found 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.250
 that on the already play a 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.810
 saved score was because benny 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.790
 as in principle on this score 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.769
 clicked and continue with the game 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.750
 So people could have the new player 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.209
 the whole figures in the game play him as 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.799
 Band then thought he was thinking 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.510
 haye wants to play the game again and with 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.040
 start a new name so old 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.100
 restarted and then the game has 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.600
 really started to become creepy 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.850
 music has started backwards too 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.920
 play and a stone statue has him 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.410
 followed with a grin on the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.570
 face he put out the file work 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.400
 this game of dough bands popped up 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 again and again on it appeared one 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.480
 second file on that was called dream and he 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.910
 drank every time when both files 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.400
 emerged and he started playing 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.410
 his character just died and the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.630
 scary message came over the screen 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.140
 you have found a bad fate 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.400
 or we come to place two the game 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.320
 berzerk reserve science of the best 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.110
 arcade games that ever existed and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.270
 The endboss is really epic it is 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.800
 just a smiley face and the one 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 smiley face has the name of this game 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.900
 has yours to be linked with two 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.060
 murder cases dailies the first person the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.370
 he died from this game 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.930
 Played this game in 1981 and short 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.090
 Later he just died 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.310
 Nobody knew how 19 years later 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.410
 Peter Burkowski had the game in 82 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.020
 had just played his name in 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.390
 the highscore entered a distance 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.400
 from the game and 15 minutes later 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.710
 he was found dead police 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.020
 Reports just state that these people are on 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.120
 heart attacks have died believe you 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.160
 the game in any way 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.750
 there it was something to do with that 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.130
 the people died are none can yes 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.620
 that something happens in the game 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.120
 what frightened her or otherwise 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.770
 somehow or do you believe that 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.810
 Online marketing strategy has it 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.480
 so old is that she is awesome again 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.650
 is and it is polybius at number one 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.780
 Not known if the game ever 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.120
 has existed or not but it is one 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.190
 in principle, similarities 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.840
 like pacman, there is only one 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.730
 single button in the game like on 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.100
 second place has people going on 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.190
 played and are due to a headache 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.410
 sleep always terror at this game 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.820
 somehow miserable, the people go away 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.860
 do not know why and you even have 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.840
 claims that the government is in the game 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.970
 was and that this is an experiment like 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.980
 said if the game existed or 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.990
 no one does not know the dead people 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.520
 However, the goods really believe you that it is 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.560
 a connection has written to me 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.970
 otherwise subscribe to the comments 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.530
 Do not forget in the description or 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.970
 just did not know that I have a gaming 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.449
 definitely visit the channel in the video 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.819

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.819
 I know you need it
