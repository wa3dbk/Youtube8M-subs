00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
code for put the lid on it when you're

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060

think<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.570> clear<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> company

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
think it's pretty clear what a company

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
think it's pretty clear what a company
gives<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> lid<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.790> comes<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.210> a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.650 
long it was under there I'm so
embarrassed<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.299> say<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.610> even<00:03:23.610> though<00:03:23.820> this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
embarrassed to say but even though this

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.110 
embarrassed to say but even though this
happened<00:03:24.930> I'm<00:03:25.350> gonna<00:03:25.620> call<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.040> an<00:03:26.190> oops<00:03:26.459> now

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
happened I'm gonna call this an oops now

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.690 
happened I'm gonna call this an oops now
when<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.299> open<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.840> jar<00:03:28.140> up<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> totally

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
when I open this jar up it was a totally

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.080 
when I open this jar up it was a totally
and<00:03:29.880> completely<00:03:31.250> rock-hard<00:03:32.250> cake<00:03:32.640> there<00:03:32.910> was

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and completely rock-hard cake there was

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.020 
and completely rock-hard cake there was
no<00:03:33.420> saving<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:35.040> here's<00:03:35.700> what<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:35.910> looks

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
no saving this so here's what it looks

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.590 
no saving this so here's what it looks
like

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
like

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.539
