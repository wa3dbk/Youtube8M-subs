00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.480 

Springs<00:01:14.290> we've<00:01:14.590> had<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.950> develop<00:01:15.130> for<00:01:15.400> this

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
Springs we've had to develop for this

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.450 
Springs we've had to develop for this
particular<00:01:15.790> car<00:01:16.210> as<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.810> bit<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.140> one-off

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.649 

because<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.549> wanted<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.000> ride<00:01:22.180> height<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.570> be

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
because we wanted the ride height to be

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.240 
because we wanted the ride height to be
as<00:01:22.810> low<00:01:22.990> as<00:01:23.020> we<00:01:23.259> can<00:01:23.350> possibly<00:01:23.530> get<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.100> it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
as low as we can possibly get it so it's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.920 
as low as we can possibly get it so it's
literally<00:01:24.580> only<00:01:24.700> got<00:01:24.880> about<00:01:24.970> two<00:01:25.270> inches<00:01:25.540> of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
literally only got about two inches of

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:52.500 
literally only got about two inches of
suspension<00:01:26.080> travel

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.200 

you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.330 
you
Oh

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.950 

the<00:02:01.579> best<00:02:01.790> fun<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.540> always<00:02:02.689> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
the best fun of all is always the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.600 
the best fun of all is always the
reaction<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:03.560> get<00:02:03.710> from<00:02:03.950> people<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:04.310> they<00:02:04.430> see

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
reaction I get from people when they see

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.830 
reaction I get from people when they see
some<00:02:04.820> effects<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.180> we've<00:02:05.360> done<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.720> this

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
some effects that we've done in this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.870 
some effects that we've done in this
particular<00:02:06.140> vehicle<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:07.310> got<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> be<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
particular vehicle it's got to be the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.520 
particular vehicle it's got to be the
biggest<00:02:08.209> smile<00:02:08.630> factor<00:02:09.080> I've<00:02:09.259> come<00:02:09.440> across

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
biggest smile factor I've come across

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.009 
biggest smile factor I've come across
yet
