 better i am racing game 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:19.119
 2002 our spark in the world of racing games in 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.189
 this year there were no good projects 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.500
 much as we would like but we don't care 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.770
 our viewers voted for you 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.470
 Best Racing Game 2012 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.190
 as well as a vote by the editorial board x 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.590
 games games and wines best racing game 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.500
 2012 and usually in the nomination there 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.700
 different in performance and quality of the game that 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.130
 came out of it 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.410
 see further and for now let's imagine 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:50.040
 our four nominees for the best 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.040
 2012 racing game look further 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.250
 So showdown participated in the nomination 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.559
 the game has nothing to do with 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.019
 previous parts and unfortunately a series 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.300
 will never be the same showdown 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.700
 tried to move away from the roots of the series and 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.729
 set foot on the territory of color you knew 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.310
 it's still a good and expensive game 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.619
 but she has become much duller than the previous ones 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.690
 it looks like caught masters finally 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.150
 resigned and decided to go the way of the sequel 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.850
 once a year slightly updated graphics and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.130
 new modes of races perhaps the first thing 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.500
 striking at all this small 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.720
 the amount of new ideas in no way 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.270
 affects on and so almost perfect 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.270
 the gameplay goes three as they say 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 who knows he will understand this game is about 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 forza horizon native hardcore series 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 forza motorcycle simulator decided 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.860
 make a curtsy towards need for 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 speed and test drive unlimited 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.080
 ask and how not to impose on you 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.509
 your favorite editorial x-games 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.550
 civic to solve this difficult question 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.890
 need help from western colleagues 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.590
 gaming press took this game very 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.270
 warmly praising the beautiful graphics 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.280
 beautiful open world and unprecedented for 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.830
 of a similar genre-fit difficulty 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.660
 gameplay here and you race for an hour 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.250
 bedtime and quite complex physics 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.160
 machines in one bottle 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.800
 and this is the whole forza horizon absolutely 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.850
 harmonious game in which content 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.850
 fits perfectly 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.690
 nedforspid bridge guy but with the next 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.100
 need for speed 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.320
 who is there to remind what 11 15 everything is wrong 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.390
 just a very warm welcome among 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.890
 journalists and almost full 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.460
 defeat among users 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.130
 let's start in order yes it's not a bridge man 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.640
 there is no plot and absolutely boring 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.800
 single 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 even last year's bored looks 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.840
 more energetic on this background but completely 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.210
 forget about the incredible powerful and fun 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.640
 multiplayer numbering tens 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.260
 various modes which analogs 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.750
 almost no competitors 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.150
 lihachevsky impudent literal sense of it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.940
 words addict stylish sequel to all 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.850
 the famous food series is the main thing 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.040
 the game was done by the developers of bernau and this 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.410
 something means u edge tirian 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.750
 a very loud whirl race 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.390
 in which everything is subject to speed and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.850
 the folds of a lively life 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.070
 tourist fairhaven but it seems not 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.630
 less heavenly than in simple colorado 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.630
 steppes of forza horizon 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.540
 f1 2012 new integration famous 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.000
 racing series based on check in to 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.640
 championship formula-1 for a person 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.320
 never played f1 before 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840
 it's very hard to understand what's new 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.210
 prepared by the developers this time and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.850
 true list for this kind of games 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.510
 pretty trite even better graphics and 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.150
 physics 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.160
 Yes, and cars and racers more another 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.440
 famous sports series FIFA 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.960
 adheres to exactly the same approach 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.240
 so we see nothing shameful in 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.430
 such a decision cold masters but 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.620
 what else can a fan wait 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.830
 super fast racing because everything is already 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.830

 guy open ryan new bridge guy 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.860
 turned out to be an ambiguous game in essence 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.539
 it's a burnout paradise with just a bunch 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.580
 expensive licensed cars 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.800

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.289
