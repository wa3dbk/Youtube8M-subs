this might be a little tall but I have
to<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> water<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> find

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to really get it on the water to find

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.180 
to really get it on the water to find
out<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.129> put<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> key<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:45.440> couple<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
out and then we put a key a couple of a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.970 
out and then we put a key a couple of a
couple<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> 3/4<00:00:49.050> inch<00:00:49.079> closed<00:00:49.410> fittings<00:00:49.829> and

couple of 3/4 inch closed fittings and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
couple of 3/4 inch closed fittings and
then<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> three-quarter<00:00:50.640> inch<00:00:50.760> caps<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
then the three-quarter inch caps this is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
then the three-quarter inch caps this is
all<00:00:51.600> galvanized<00:00:52.670> probably<00:00:53.670> hit<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.940> some

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
all galvanized probably hit it with some

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
all galvanized probably hit it with some
paint<00:00:54.239> anyway<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> galvanized<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
paint anyway but the galvanized is a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.380 
paint anyway but the galvanized is a
little<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> us<00:00:56.879> nice<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
little bit more of us nice because it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
little bit more of us nice because it
doesn't<00:00:57.539> rust<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:59.250> nice<00:00:59.520> thing<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
doesn't rust this nice thing about this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
doesn't rust this nice thing about this
is<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.270> you're<00:01:00.420> coming<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.809> under<00:01:01.020> any<00:01:01.109> low

if<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.270> you're<00:01:06.420> blind

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
if this will get the way you're blind

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.859 
if this will get the way you're blind
you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.140> unthread<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
you can just unthread this from the

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
you can just unthread this from the
t-one<00:01:09.869> thread<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> base<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
t-one thread from the base and then you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.060 
t-one thread from the base and then you
can<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.659> pull<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.760> set<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.030> down

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
can just pull it out and set it down

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
can just pull it out and set it down
that's<00:01:17.070> actually<00:01:17.430> why<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> other

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that's actually why in some of the other

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
that's actually why in some of the other
videos<00:01:18.540> you'll<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> boat<00:01:20.180> some<00:01:21.180> of

the videos of the mud motor running
you'll<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.590> she<00:01:25.770> threads

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you'll see just like that she threads

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.780 
you'll see just like that she threads
out<00:01:26.360> some<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> other<00:01:27.600> videos<00:01:28.790> you're

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
conduit bent to shape you see the holes
in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> rib<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> side

in the rib and I'm on it from the side
of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> room<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.259> 5/16<00:01:41.070> hardware<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180

was okay but it was fixed so you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
was okay but it was fixed so you
couldn't<00:01:43.890> take<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.689> could<00:01:45.689> have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
couldn't take it down could have

couple bridges this year when the water
is<00:01:50.939> high<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.560> was<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.979> flimsy<00:01:53.189> for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
is high and just was a little flimsy for

is high and just was a little flimsy for
my<00:01:53.759> liking<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.119> we'll<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.810> new<00:01:55.079> style

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
my liking so we'll try this new style

my liking so we'll try this new style
out<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:56.460> another<00:01:56.670> buddy<00:01:56.909> that's<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
out got another buddy that's going to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
out got another buddy that's going to
show<00:01:57.390> us<00:01:57.509> his<00:01:57.659> design<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.770> actually<00:01:59.070> real

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
show us his design it's actually real

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
show us his design it's actually real
similar<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.630> galvanized<00:02:01.020> pipe<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
similar to the galvanized pipe in a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.510 
similar to the galvanized pipe in a
piece<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.860> Wilmington<00:02:02.070> snackie

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
piece and Wilmington snackie

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
piece and Wilmington snackie
that's<00:02:02.790> actually<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> his<00:02:03.450> design<00:02:04.189> he

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that's actually kind of his design he

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.289 
that's actually kind of his design he
just<00:02:05.219> did<00:02:05.490> his<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:05.790> different<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> little

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
just did his a little different a little

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.290 
just did his a little different a little
easier<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> remove<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.819> kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> slides<00:02:09.119> out

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
easier to remove just kind of slides out

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300 
easier to remove just kind of slides out
but<00:02:09.450> we'll<00:02:09.539> show<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.310> hopefully

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
but we'll show you that then hopefully

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.140 
but we'll show you that then hopefully
this<00:02:11.459> helps<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.760> thanks<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.750> watching
