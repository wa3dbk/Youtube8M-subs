see<00:01:22.380> stir<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.009> big<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.490> against<00:01:23.909> my

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
see stir I'm big time against my

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.359 
see stir I'm big time against my
daughter<00:01:24.299> getting<00:01:24.869> bigger<00:01:25.409> breasts<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.039> think

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
daughter getting bigger breasts I think

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.350 
daughter getting bigger breasts I think
that's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.610> bad<00:01:26.820> idea

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that's a bad idea

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
that's a bad idea
I<00:01:27.539> think<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.930> Ashley<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.530> larger<00:01:29.159> breast

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
I think if Ashley got larger breast

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 
I think if Ashley got larger breast
implants<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.049> take<00:01:31.079> her<00:01:31.380> in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
implants I think that would take her in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
implants I think that would take her in
the<00:01:31.590> wrong<00:01:31.740> direction<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.399> she'd<00:01:32.640> probably

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the wrong direction and she'd probably

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
the wrong direction and she'd probably
start<00:01:33.149> attracting<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.810> wrong<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> guys

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
start attracting the wrong kind of guys

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.919 
start attracting the wrong kind of guys
my<00:01:35.340> fear<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.700> Ashley<00:01:36.210> might<00:01:36.750> become

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
my fear is that Ashley might become

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.080 
my fear is that Ashley might become
addicted<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> plastic<00:01:37.710> surgery<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
addicted to plastic surgery and think

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
surgery was not my stepdaughter Ashley
is<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.240> satisfied<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.360> her<00:01:54.509> breast<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:55.590> she

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is not satisfied with her breast as she

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.559 
is not satisfied with her breast as she
wishes<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.280> were<00:01:56.340> larger<00:01:56.789> she<00:01:57.270> wants<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
wishes they were larger she wants a

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.469 
wishes they were larger she wants a
double<00:01:57.689> D<00:01:57.959> I<00:01:58.289> think<00:01:58.649> Ashley<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.399> perfect<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
double D I think Ashley is perfect the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.889 
double D I think Ashley is perfect the
way<00:02:00.509> she<00:02:00.599> is<00:02:00.860> her<00:02:01.860> body<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.630> it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
way she is her body it's I think it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.570 
way she is her body it's I think it's
all<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> proportion<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.979> think<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.250> she<00:02:05.399> goes

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
all in proportion I think if she goes

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.219 
all in proportion I think if she goes
larger<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.330> be<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.599> of<00:02:06.630> proportion

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
larger it's gonna be out of proportion

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
larger it's gonna be out of proportion
and<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.830> think<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.489> will<00:02:08.610> draw<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> wrong

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and I think we will draw the wrong

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.819 
and I think we will draw the wrong
attention<00:02:11.780> -<00:02:12.780> Lee<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> very<00:02:13.560> intelligent

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
attention - Lee is a very intelligent

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.370 
attention - Lee is a very intelligent
girl<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.940> some<00:02:15.150> people<00:02:15.239> may<00:02:15.780> look<00:02:15.989> at

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
girl but I think some people may look at

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
girl but I think some people may look at
Ashley<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.000> she's<00:02:18.180> really

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
Ashley and not think that she's really

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
Ashley and not think that she's really
intelligent<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.069> her

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
intelligent if all they can see is her

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.110 
intelligent if all they can see is her
larger<00:02:20.640> breasts<00:02:20.880> Ashley<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.220> way<00:02:23.220> too<00:02:23.280> young<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
larger breasts Ashley is way too young I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000 
larger breasts Ashley is way too young I
