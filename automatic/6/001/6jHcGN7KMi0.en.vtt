00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello to all I am I alone 100 and today I will teach you how to download the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.219
 game out on the pc 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.929
 good for those who do not know what is this volvo I leave here a small 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 review 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 taboo and the dark game of nintendo 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.929
 effectively 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.439
 it's weird that nintendo 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 great friend of censorship 20 years ago 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.820
 gave good to one of the few dark games in the last century 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.670
 super taboo 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.440
 of six senses 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.100
 maybe the most classic gamers remember him or not 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.170
 since it's actually a tarot simulator for the mythical console of the great 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.660
 n 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.640
 the family com 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.190
 you put 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.330
 naked eye 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.870
 Surprise the dark atmosphere of the game 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.250
 and its menu is the most normal thing in the world but the use of tarotist jargon and its 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.719
 too strong statements when predicting something left more than one 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.670
 Surprised 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.270
 I can imagine the controversy that this game could have had in those years 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.220
 according to your manual 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.130
 Tamudo is the version for nes of the cult and ancient prediction system 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.850
 of the future of the tarot all the mystery of the tarot has been incorporated to the most 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.130
 deep of this cartridge his enigmas flow in crypt two by his circuits 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.670
 representing a meeting of an ancient miracle with the modern miracle of the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 technology and science serving you in the same way that a priest does 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 I would do with an emperor 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.970
 Now if you want to know more about this game you will have to see some of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.510
 urban legends that are scattered throughout this October 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.350
 let's stop legends and go to whatever came 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.280
 go to the following link that is in the description of the video 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.509
 they wait for the seconds and when they finish they give it in normal discharge 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.809
 but if you have a premium account then you go ctes 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.300
 as in this case I am poor and of a large family I will have to wait 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.379
 while we wait for a joke 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.529
 I was pepito in his house and his mom says 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.269
 hey tepito that the store to buy a kilo of egg 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.959
 Then Pepito leaves and after a while he returns saying 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.199
 mama mom ran over kinko 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.389
 they had flown one leg by agca and another by there one arm here and another 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.549
 until there 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.429
 and his mother asks him 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.049
 hey tepito and the eggs 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.939
 hung on a wire 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:16.349
 jajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd from ddb 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.189
 but what a bad joke 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.909
 good they give him in normal discharge and they keep it in the desk 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.539
 then they will get a rar file like this 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.539
 they select them and they give him to bring here 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.269
 and a folder like this will appear 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.559
 they open it and they go to the icon that says virtual 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.559
 which looks like a box of I do not know what with cables 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.039
 the selection will not even appear a black window 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.209
 they go to where it says file 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.289
 then where it says open rum and search and select the file that says 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 they give in to open and ready you already have the game 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.049
 they will notice that there are more files 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.049
 Well, these are more games for the emulator 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.069
 once inside the command controls are 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.800
 the vote nothing 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 is the letter of the keyboard v 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.540
 and the letter b 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 is the same letter wash 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.340
 in the movements the directional arrows are used 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.809
 I will explain how it works 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.859
 here it is produced only with names and surnames using the arrows of 

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.650
 direction to move the red box that selects the letters 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.529
 press is the vote nothing that in this case in the v to be able to select the 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.749
 when they finish they give him elements 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:06.799
 which is on the bottom right of the screen after they put their date 

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:09.599
 of birth that is only two digits 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.059
 the date of birth is put in the following way 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.339
 month 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.119
 then he will select the letters m and f for men 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.789
 yf for female 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.039
 just select your gender 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.139
 if you were to select a letter that was not just select it 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.849
 which is in the bottom left of the screen 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.150
 here you ask your question in English 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.389
 since Americans only think about them and not those who speak Spanish 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.080
 at the end of writing they give him where he says that they already know where he is 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.449
 and will start to vary the cards revealing one by one what awaits you 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.560
 Of course the answers will be in English so grab your donkeys grave 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.330
 Latin dictionary English-Spanish and number that says 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.879
 Well, that was everything 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.280
 I hope you enjoyed it and enjoy the other games that this has 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.889
 emulator 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.659
 and comment 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:20.509
 until next time
