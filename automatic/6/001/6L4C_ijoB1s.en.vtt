00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
well why even though it doesn't have the

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.690 
well why even though it doesn't have the
drift<00:01:17.810> wing<00:01:18.050> we'll<00:01:18.619> see<00:01:18.800> in<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.979> minute<00:01:19.250> it's

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
drift wing we'll see in a minute it's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.040 
drift wing we'll see in a minute it's
actually<00:01:19.970> pretty<00:01:20.210> good<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:20.600> drifting

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
actually pretty good for drifting

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.809 
actually pretty good for drifting
because<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.590> figured<00:01:21.890> out<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.009> new<00:01:22.310> method<00:01:22.700> of

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
because I figured out a new method of

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.969 
because I figured out a new method of
drifting<00:01:23.539> on<00:01:23.720> my<00:01:24.319> method

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
drifting on my method

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.469 
drifting on my method
I<00:01:25.009> wasn't<00:01:25.460> tips<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:25.940> tricks<00:01:26.149> I'll<00:01:26.330> probably

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
I wasn't tips and tricks I'll probably

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.809 
I wasn't tips and tricks I'll probably
do<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.690> in<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.929> video<00:01:27.050> soon<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:28.700> now

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
do that in a video soon but for now

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.889 
do that in a video soon but for now
