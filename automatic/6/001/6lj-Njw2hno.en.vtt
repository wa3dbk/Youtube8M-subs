00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 people welcome to one 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.510
 short update video for the samsung 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.480
 galaxy s2 you see the phone here could 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.250
 even unlock it briefly 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.040
 samsung finally did it 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.150
 to deliver next android update 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.230
 the samsung galaxy s2 was yes 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.769
 delivered with the android version 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.719
 2.3.3 and samsung has done it now 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.219
 to deliver the update on android 2.3.4 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.380
 I can tell you this very briefly 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.540
 Show if you are on the setting 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
 go and then here and on the phone 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.360
 info then you see it here 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.010
 he is now the android version 2.3.4 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.949
 on it yes htc she has the year at the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.670
 htc sensation for quite some time 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.949
 delivered 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.760
 As I said Samsung now has here 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.890
 tightened 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.270
 which is a bit strange and that is 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.460
 for you too important to know 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.210
 You can not override this update 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.920
 rather, that does not mean referring 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.860
 simply over the mobile phone over wlan 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.479
 there was the indulgence that indicated no 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 update would be present but you have to 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.869
 all about gravel and then 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.200
 this also works if necessary 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.030
 you have to have your gravel version before 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.890
 times before he does that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.110
 but then it works too 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 has taken me a long time 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.530
 had to first make the update of keys 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.100
 and then the new operating system 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.840
 to install 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.840
 So I'm almost an hour 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.979
 come but of course yes is one 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.439
 not understandable why not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.990
 but he comes what is the main thing it 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.720
 is now that the samsung galaxy s2 is 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 overall even faster 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 I have in the quadrant is far over 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320
 3000 points achieved with the new 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.399
 update and the battery really lasts longer 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.689
 as previously 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.119
 you have to say that one too 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.030
 Overall, I am very optimistic 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.860
 happy with this update and better 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.990
 late than never 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.520
 yes friends that should have been 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.710
 if you do not have the update yet 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.390
 includes expensive samsung galaxy s2 like 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.980
 said to keys and then you will 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.020
 also have relatively fast 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.580
 that is what it should have been, thank you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.740
 I hope to watch this little one 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 how did you like and I always say 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.440
 until next time or c
