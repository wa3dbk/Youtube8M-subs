00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.630
 we proceed to show the dissection of the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.930
 gluteal region after the incisions 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 we remove the skin and the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.800
 subcutaneous cellular tissue 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.150
 Adipose tissue 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.570
 and we reach the muscular plane 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.470
 superficially the muscle is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 gluteus maximus 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.469
 after pouring the gluteus medius 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.370
 and in a deeper plane to the gluteus 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.370
 less 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.840
 there we can see the gluteal nerve 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840
 higher 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 next to this is the muscle 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 pyramidal or piriform 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 we can see the supra pyramidal space or 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 supra piriform 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.390
 the space infra pyramidal or infra 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.570
 piriform where the nerve comes from 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.570
 sciatic 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.350
 next to this is the nerve 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.350
 cutaneous femoral 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.760
 if we remove the sciatic nerve 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.250
 we observed the superior muscle 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.020
 to the internal obturator muscle 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.790
 and the inferior muscle 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.879
 we can see the head of the femur 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.170
 next to this square femoral muscle 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.349
 and the biceps femoral muscle
