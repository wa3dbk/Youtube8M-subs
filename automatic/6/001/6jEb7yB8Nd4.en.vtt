alright<00:00:01.560> in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.800> tutorial<00:00:02.330> we<00:00:03.330> will<00:00:03.360> be

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
alright in this tutorial we will be

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.200 
alright in this tutorial we will be
going<00:00:04.020> over<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:05.310> custom<00:00:07.370> validation<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.820> text

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
going over a custom validation of a text

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.839 
going over a custom validation of a text
field<00:00:10.429> so<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:12.230> guess<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> only<00:00:13.559> time<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.219> guess

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
field so I guess the only time I guess

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
field so I guess the only time I guess
you're<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> use<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.260> if

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you're really going to use this is if

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.269 
you're really going to use this is if
the<00:00:17.789> types<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.779> were<00:00:19.470> defined<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.100> last

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the types that were defined in the last

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910 
the types that were defined in the last
tutorial<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.600> exactly<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.710> need

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
tutorial are not exactly what you need

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.019 
tutorial are not exactly what you need
and<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> custom<00:00:25.609> validation<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and with the custom validation that you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
and with the custom validation that you
can<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:28.260> create<00:00:28.980> any<00:00:29.519> pattern<00:00:30.470> that<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
can really create any pattern that you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
can really create any pattern that you
want<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.000> few<00:00:36.390> simple<00:00:36.600> rules

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
want and it is just a few simple rules

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.590 
want and it is just a few simple rules
that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.530> follow<00:00:38.270> better<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that you have to follow better than that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.549 
that you have to follow better than that
it's<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.530> easy<00:00:40.829> pretty<00:00:42.559> pretty

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's pretty pretty easy pretty pretty

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's pretty pretty easy pretty pretty
and<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.579> won't<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> long<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> figure<00:00:45.450> out

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and it won't take you long to figure out

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.729 
and it won't take you long to figure out
I<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:47.690> here's<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I don't think but here's how we do it we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.760 
I don't think but here's how we do it we
go<00:00:49.890> ahead<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.430> click<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.050> custom<00:00:52.050> inside

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
go ahead and we click on custom inside

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.270 
go ahead and we click on custom inside
of<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.010> type<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.840> we<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.469> into

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
of our type and we go down here into

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.549 
of our type and we go down here into
pattern<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:58.280> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.320> some

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pattern and if you if you have some

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.729 
pattern and if you if you have some
paper<00:01:02.420> around<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.110> might<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> take

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
paper around you might want to take

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.550 
paper around you might want to take
notes<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> say

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
notes on on what I'm about to say

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.440 
notes on on what I'm about to say
because<00:01:08.030> there<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.990> few<00:01:10.470> different

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
because there are a few different

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.940 
because there are a few different
characters<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.430> put<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.210> pattern

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
characters that you put into the pattern

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.359 
characters that you put into the pattern
that<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.600> drastically<00:01:18.600> change<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:20.009> can

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that will drastically change what can

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.320 
that will drastically change what can
and<00:01:20.790> cannot<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.560> inserted<00:01:22.560> into<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> text

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and cannot be inserted into the text

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
and cannot be inserted into the text
field<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.750> sell<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.610> just

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
field to sell so right now I'm just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
field to sell so right now I'm just
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.030> ahead<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.200> zeros<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
going to go ahead and put some zeros in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.170 
going to go ahead and put some zeros in
and<00:01:29.759> time<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> pattern<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.610> these<00:01:32.610> zeros

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and time I pattern here and these zeros

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.520 
and time I pattern here and these zeros
mean<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.350> whole<00:01:34.979> number<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:36.329> between<00:01:36.659> 0

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
mean a whole number a number between 0

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
mean a whole number a number between 0
and<00:01:37.799> nine<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.180> sure<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and nine if you want to make sure that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960 
and nine if you want to make sure that
someone<00:01:40.350> enters<00:01:40.710> five<00:01:40.950> digits<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> type

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
someone enters five digits then you type

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.770 
someone enters five digits then you type
five<00:01:42.720> zeros<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:44.369> pattern<00:01:44.729> field<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
five zeros in the pattern field and I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.389 
five zeros in the pattern field and I
mean<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> same<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.770> zip<00:01:46.979> code<00:01:47.159> so

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mean that's the same as a zip code so

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
mean that's the same as a zip code so
you<00:01:47.490> wouldn't<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.689> wouldn't<00:01:48.869> really

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you wouldn't really you wouldn't really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
you wouldn't really you wouldn't really
need<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.720> just

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
need to do that but if that's just

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
need to do that but if that's just
that's<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.500> example<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.159> say<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that's just an example so say that you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.200 
that's just an example so say that you
have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> number<00:01:55.399> or<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.700> some<00:01:56.909> kind<00:01:57.149> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
have a number or you have some kind of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
have a number or you have some kind of
ID<00:01:57.390> number<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.049> looks<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
ID number that looks like this and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
ID number that looks like this and
they're<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.520> whole<00:01:59.909> numbers<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.570> have

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
they're all whole numbers so you have

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
they're all whole numbers so you have
five<00:02:01.140> numbers<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.040> high<00:02:02.250> thin<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> then

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
five numbers and then high thin and then

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.260 
five numbers and then high thin and then
two<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.380> numbers<00:02:04.560> after<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:09.179> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
two more numbers after that so you can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
two more numbers after that so you can
also<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:11.009> also<00:02:11.160> say<00:02:11.700> say<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.629> want<00:02:12.930> like

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
also can also say say you want like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.440 
also can also say say you want like
a<00:02:13.709> date<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:21.180> same<00:02:23.239> text<00:02:24.239> field

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
a date and a time in the same text field

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.030 
a date and a time in the same text field
then<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:25.019> enter<00:02:25.260> something<00:02:25.560> exactly

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
then you can enter something exactly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.160 
then you can enter something exactly
like<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.079> you<00:02:28.079> will<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.379> able<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:30.170> have

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
like that and you will be able to have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.890 
like that and you will be able to have
the<00:02:31.349> user<00:02:31.590> input<00:02:32.189> the<00:02:32.760> time<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:35.900> actually

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the user input the time with actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.440 
the user input the time with actually
that's<00:02:37.079> more<00:02:37.319> like<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> date<00:02:38.159> I'm<00:02:38.430> sorry<00:02:38.700> date

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
that's more like a date I'm sorry date

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.240 
that's more like a date I'm sorry date
and<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> time<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:42.470> that's<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.829> do

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and the time so that's how you do

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.039 
and the time so that's how you do
numbers<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.359> want<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> do<00:02:45.690> any<00:02:45.870> number

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
numbers so if you want to do any number

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.050 
numbers so if you want to do any number
between<00:02:46.319> zero<00:02:46.829> nine<00:02:47.099> all<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.579> have<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.909> is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
between zero nine all you have to do is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.009 
between zero nine all you have to do is
zero<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:50.340> indicate<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:51.090> single

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
zero and so to indicate a single

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.190 
zero and so to indicate a single
uppercase<00:02:52.709> alphabetic<00:02:53.519> character<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:55.049> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
uppercase alphabetic character then you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.440 
uppercase alphabetic character then you
will<00:02:55.349> type<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:56.359> capital<00:02:57.359> A<00:02:57.889> so<00:02:59.420> for<00:03:00.420> instance

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
will type in a capital A so for instance

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.559 
will type in a capital A so for instance
you<00:03:00.900> type<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.409> capital<00:03:01.889> A<00:03:02.040> zero<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
you type in a capital A zero and a

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.300 
you type in a capital A zero and a
capital<00:03:03.989> A<00:03:04.159> then<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:06.750> will<00:03:07.319> allow<00:03:07.889> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
capital A then that will allow the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.129 
capital A then that will allow the
person<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.730> put<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.329> any<00:03:09.989> capital<00:03:11.900> any<00:03:12.900> capital

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
person to put in any capital any capital

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.890 
person to put in any capital any capital
letter<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:14.069> number<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.389> capital

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
letter a number and then a capital

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.800 
letter a number and then a capital
letter<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.370> capital<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.970> means<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.599> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
letter the capital a means that the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.680 
letter the capital a means that the
letter<00:03:19.019> has<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.099> capital<00:03:20.579> though<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
letter has to be capital though if you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.920 
letter has to be capital though if you
want<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.079> lowercase<00:03:23.069> letter<00:03:23.609> then<00:03:24.389> you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
want to do a lowercase letter then you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.009 
want to do a lowercase letter then you
can<00:03:25.139> say<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:28.790> 0<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:30.629> that<00:03:30.780> would<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
can say a 0 a and then that would be the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.449 
can say a 0 a and then that would be the
same<00:03:31.199> as<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.409> last<00:03:31.590> except<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.129> letters

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
same as the last except the letters

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.960 
same as the last except the letters
would<00:03:32.669> have<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:33.239> be<00:03:33.480> lowercase<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.549> pattern

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
would have to be lowercase the pattern

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.619 
would have to be lowercase the pattern
AAA<00:03:37.280> would<00:03:38.280> mean<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:40.440> would<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.919> to

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
AAA would mean that you would have to

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.439 
AAA would mean that you would have to
put<00:03:42.629> in<00:03:42.780> lowercase<00:03:43.349> letters<00:03:43.949> for<00:03:44.459> all<00:03:44.729> three

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
put in lowercase letters for all three

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.300 
put in lowercase letters for all three
letters<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.900> be<00:03:46.049> lowercase<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.799> if<00:03:47.220> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
letters have to be lowercase so if it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.000 
letters have to be lowercase so if it
was<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:48.180> would<00:03:48.419> be<00:03:48.629> acceptable<00:03:49.470> but

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
was a a that would be acceptable but

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.960 
was a a that would be acceptable but
this<00:03:50.489> would<00:03:50.849> not<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.030> acceptable<00:03:51.979> to<00:03:52.979> accept

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
this would not be acceptable to accept

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.719 
this would not be acceptable to accept
either<00:03:54.239> an<00:03:54.780> uppercase<00:03:55.650> or<00:03:55.949> lowercase<00:03:56.010> letter

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
either an uppercase or lowercase letter

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.349 
either an uppercase or lowercase letter
then<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.510> will<00:03:57.659> use<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.319> capital<00:03:58.680> B<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.519> the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
then you will use a capital B so the

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.569 
then you will use a capital B so the
pattern<00:04:01.220> BBB<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.489> capital<00:04:03.150> B<00:04:03.299> 3<00:04:03.780> times<00:04:04.579> will

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
pattern BBB a capital B 3 times will

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.949 
pattern BBB a capital B 3 times will
accept<00:04:06.180> boast<00:04:06.510> lowercase<00:04:07.229> letters<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:08.190> also

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
accept boast lowercase letters and also

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.860 
accept boast lowercase letters and also
uppercase<00:04:09.959> letters<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:12.359> include<00:04:12.720> numbers

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
uppercase letters to include numbers

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.349 
uppercase letters to include numbers
along<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.769> uppercase<00:04:14.159> letters<00:04:14.609> then<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
along with uppercase letters then you

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.529 
along with uppercase letters then you
can<00:04:15.569> use<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.709> X<00:04:18.440> actually<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:20.159> a<00:04:20.539> capital

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
can use the X actually it is a a capital

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.450 
can use the X actually it is a a capital
X

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
X

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.400 
X
the<00:04:23.180> letter<00:04:23.449> X<00:04:23.750> messes<00:04:24.819> both<00:04:26.169> numbers<00:04:27.169> and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
the letter X messes both numbers and

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.939 
the letter X messes both numbers and
lowercase<00:04:28.150> alphabetical<00:04:29.150> characters<00:04:29.949> you

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
lowercase alphabetical characters you

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:37.059 
lowercase alphabetical characters you
use<00:04:31.190> capital<00:04:31.880> y<00:04:32.259> 4<00:04:33.259> case<00:04:34.250> sensitive<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:36.069> mean

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
use capital y 4 case sensitive I mean

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.790 
use capital y 4 case sensitive I mean
case<00:04:37.370> insensitive<00:04:38.030> match<00:04:38.750> for<00:04:39.410> numbers<00:04:39.650> and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
case insensitive match for numbers and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.969 
case insensitive match for numbers and
letters<00:04:40.039> so<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:42.229> if<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.530> use<00:04:42.740> X<00:04:43.520> X<00:04:44.120> X<00:04:44.860> just<00:04:45.860> like

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
letters so so if you use X X X just like

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.960 
letters so so if you use X X X just like
that<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:46.970> will<00:04:47.720> match<00:04:49.150> b2b<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:51.970> BBB

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
that then that will match b2b and BBB

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.610 
that then that will match b2b and BBB
and<00:04:53.660> also<00:04:54.620> one<00:04:55.039> two<00:04:55.250> three<00:04:55.960> but<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.259> will<00:04:57.440> not

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and also one two three but it will not

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:07.689 
and also one two three but it will not
match<00:04:58.810> b2b<00:04:59.810> or<00:05:01.360> BBB<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:05.919> basically<00:05:06.919> just<00:05:07.550> to

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
match b2b or BBB so basically just to

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.240 
match b2b or BBB so basically just to
recap<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.960> include<00:05:09.139> numbers<00:05:09.560> along<00:05:09.979> with

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
recap that to include numbers along with

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.810 
recap that to include numbers along with
uppercase<00:05:10.669> letters<00:05:11.060> use<00:05:11.599> a<00:05:11.930> capital<00:05:12.410> X<00:05:12.820> the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
uppercase letters use a capital X the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.839 
uppercase letters use a capital X the
letter<00:05:14.090> X<00:05:14.949> matches<00:05:15.949> both<00:05:16.130> numbers<00:05:16.550> and

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
letter X matches both numbers and

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.820 
letter X matches both numbers and
lowercase<00:05:17.229> alphabetical<00:05:18.229> characters<00:05:20.830> so

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
lowercase alphabetical characters so

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.379 
lowercase alphabetical characters so
also<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.270> need<00:05:23.509> to<00:05:24.669> use<00:05:25.669> anything<00:05:26.060> else

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
also if you need to use anything else

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.029 
also if you need to use anything else
you<00:05:26.539> can<00:05:26.599> use<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> question<00:05:27.169> mark<00:05:27.409> as<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:28.009> a

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
you can use a question mark as like a

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.760 
you can use a question mark as like a
wild<00:05:28.430> card<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:29.810> stands<00:05:30.110> for<00:05:30.229> any<00:05:30.409> character

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
wild card it stands for any character

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.360 
wild card it stands for any character
whatsoever<00:05:30.919> so<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.740> should<00:05:33.949> use<00:05:34.099> it<00:05:34.250> when<00:05:34.340> a

what you want so I think for that that
is<00:05:47.570> about<00:05:47.780> it<00:05:47.840> oh<00:05:48.169> one<00:05:48.919> more<00:05:49.039> thing<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.490> the

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
is about it oh one more thing of the

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.120 
is about it oh one more thing of the
enforcing<00:05:50.090> pattern<00:05:50.570> down<00:05:51.199> here<00:05:51.590> you<00:05:51.889> can<00:05:52.039> make

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
enforcing pattern down here you can make

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.180 
enforcing pattern down here you can make
sure<00:05:52.419> incorrect<00:05:53.419> characters<00:05:53.840> aren't<00:05:54.289> even

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
sure incorrect characters aren't even

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.279 
sure incorrect characters aren't even
allowed<00:05:55.280> into<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.030> form<00:05:56.389> filled<00:05:56.630> by<00:05:56.840> turning<00:05:57.139> it

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
allowed into a form filled by turning it

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.279 
allowed into a form filled by turning it
on<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:57.770> like<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.479> want<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.719> turn<00:05:59.840> on<00:06:00.050> the

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
on so like if you want to turn on the

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.890 
on so like if you want to turn on the
horse<00:06:00.919> pattern<00:06:01.099> checkbox<00:06:01.699> when<00:06:02.570> this<00:06:02.659> option

horse pattern checkbox when this option

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.649 
horse pattern checkbox when this option
is<00:06:03.080> selected<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:04.190> form<00:06:04.520> field<00:06:04.849> blocks<00:06:05.449> the

is selected the form field blocks the
input<00:06:05.990> of<00:06:06.020> invalid<00:06:06.560> characters<00:06:06.919> so<00:06:07.099> it<00:06:07.219> won't

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
input of invalid characters so it won't

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.159 
input of invalid characters so it won't
even<00:06:07.610> allow<00:06:07.789> them<00:06:08.180> like<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.570> be<00:06:08.690> put<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:08.960> there

even allow them like to be put in there

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.100 
even allow them like to be put in there
for<00:06:09.740> example<00:06:10.130> suppose<00:06:10.909> you<00:06:11.120> added<00:06:11.300> a<00:06:11.690> sprite

enforced pattern option were turned on
for<00:06:26.000> this<00:06:26.120> field<00:06:26.479> then<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.110> visitor<00:06:27.680> can<00:06:28.280> only

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
for this field then a visitor can only

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.219 
for this field then a visitor can only
type<00:06:28.909> five<00:06:29.240> numbers<00:06:29.599> in<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:29.750> field<00:06:29.960> and

type five numbers in the field and

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.200 
type five numbers in the field and
that's<00:06:30.440> all<00:06:30.680> they<00:06:30.830> could<00:06:30.889> type<00:06:31.159> is<00:06:31.370> if<00:06:31.669> a

that's all they could type is if a

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.940 
that's all they could type is if a
visitor<00:06:32.630> clicks<00:06:32.930> into<00:06:33.349> the<00:06:33.800> field<00:06:34.039> and<00:06:34.310> types

visitor clicks into the field and types

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.180 
visitor clicks into the field and types
letter<00:06:35.130> a<00:06:35.340> nothing<00:06:36.060> happens<00:06:36.420> because<00:06:36.600> it<00:06:36.750> only

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
letter a nothing happens because it only

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:44.300 
letter a nothing happens because it only
accepts<00:06:38.270> le<00:06:39.270> accepts<00:06:39.870> numbers<00:06:41.990> so<00:06:43.070> if<00:06:44.070> you

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
accepts le accepts numbers so if you

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.550 
accepts le accepts numbers so if you
want<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.730> enforce<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.480> pattern<00:06:45.810> strictly<00:06:46.380> and

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
want to enforce the pattern strictly and

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.770 
want to enforce the pattern strictly and
not<00:06:46.800> allow<00:06:47.100> any<00:06:47.430> characters<00:06:47.940> whatsoever<00:06:48.540> to

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
be allowed inside of the text box then

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.130 
be allowed inside of the text box then
you<00:06:53.790> will<00:06:53.940> use<00:06:54.240> the<00:06:54.480> enforced<00:06:55.170> pattern<00:06:55.880> and

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
you will use the enforced pattern and

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.170 
you will use the enforced pattern and
that<00:06:58.940> is<00:06:59.940> it<00:07:00.150> for<00:07:00.330> this<00:07:01.020> tutorial<00:07:01.880> i'm<00:07:02.880> in<00:07:03.090> the

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
that is it for this tutorial i'm in the

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.820 
that is it for this tutorial i'm in the
next<00:07:03.450> tutorial<00:07:03.600> we<00:07:04.110> are<00:07:04.140> going<00:07:04.290> to<00:07:04.530> be<00:07:04.620> going

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
next tutorial we are going to be going

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:15.710 
next tutorial we are going to be going
over<00:07:07.640> text<00:07:08.640> area<00:07:09.470> and<00:07:13.130> we<00:07:14.130> will<00:07:14.310> see<00:07:14.550> the<00:07:15.420> text

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
over text area and we will see the text

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.110 
over text area and we will see the text
area<00:07:15.840> isn't<00:07:16.140> as<00:07:16.610> detailed<00:07:17.610> as<00:07:19.070> the<00:07:20.070> text<00:07:20.400> box<00:07:20.790> I

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
area isn't as detailed as the text box I

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.760 
area isn't as detailed as the text box I
order<00:07:21.450> the<00:07:21.540> text<00:07:22.250> field<00:07:23.250> validation<00:07:23.910> was

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
order the text field validation was

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.840 
order the text field validation was
where<00:07:25.770> there<00:07:25.890> are<00:07:26.040> some<00:07:26.190> cool<00:07:26.340> things<00:07:26.550> that

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
where there are some cool things that

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.540 
where there are some cool things that
will<00:07:27.030> be<00:07:27.150> able<00:07:27.270> to<00:07:27.390> do<00:07:27.570> with<00:07:27.720> that<00:07:27.870> so

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
will be able to do with that so

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.290 
will be able to do with that so
hopefully<00:07:29.550> you're<00:07:29.670> looking<00:07:29.910> forward<00:07:30.120> to
