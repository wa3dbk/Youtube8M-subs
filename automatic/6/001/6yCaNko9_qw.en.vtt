this little guy's not comparable to this
guy<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.720> mean<00:03:47.840> that's<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.170> sort<00:03:48.320> of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
guy and I mean that's the sort of

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.870 
guy and I mean that's the sort of
deficit<00:03:48.860> we're<00:03:48.980> talking<00:03:49.310> about<00:03:49.400> here<00:03:49.700> he's

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
deficit we're talking about here he's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.940 
deficit we're talking about here he's
just<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.240> get<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> little<00:03:50.750> little<00:03:50.900> off<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.560> 1/3

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
just I get a little little off I get 1/3
