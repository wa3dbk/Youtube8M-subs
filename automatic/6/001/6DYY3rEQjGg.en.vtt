00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.409 
this or whatever and everyone here is
really<00:05:09.159> on<00:05:09.340> top<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.580> their<00:05:09.789> stuff<00:05:10.030> but<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.240> want

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
really on top of their stuff but I want

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.969 
really on top of their stuff but I want
to<00:05:10.539> say<00:05:10.690> there's<00:05:10.900> anything<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.289> sets<00:05:11.590> any<00:05:11.860> as

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
to say there's anything that sets any as

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.339 
to say there's anything that sets any as
mechanics<00:05:12.430> apart<00:05:12.729> as<00:05:13.060> well<00:05:13.419> as<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:14.229> know

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
mechanics apart as well as you know

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.890 
mechanics apart as well as you know
their<00:05:14.680> bike<00:05:14.860> prep<00:05:15.159> or<00:05:15.400> how<00:05:16.060> they<00:05:16.240> assemble<00:05:16.720> I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
their bike prep or how they assemble I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.839 
their bike prep or how they assemble I
think<00:05:17.590> as<00:05:17.919> long<00:05:18.070> as<00:05:18.220> everyone<00:05:18.520> does<00:05:18.550> their<00:05:18.789> job

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
think as long as everyone does their job

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.200 
think as long as everyone does their job
and<00:05:19.330> no<00:05:19.419> nuts<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.840> bolts<00:05:20.080> fall<00:05:20.289> out<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:21.210> stuff

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
and no nuts and bolts fall out and stuff

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.330 
and no nuts and bolts fall out and stuff
doesn't<00:05:22.419> go<00:05:22.630> wrong<00:05:23.009> that's<00:05:24.009> all<00:05:24.130> that<00:05:24.250> really

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
doesn't go wrong that's all that really

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.020 
doesn't go wrong that's all that really
matters

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
matters

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.470 
matters
I<00:05:26.060> think<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.720> best<00:05:26.870> part<00:05:27.020> is<00:05:27.170> to<00:05:27.230> travel<00:05:28.480> you

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
I think the best part is to travel you

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.020 
I think the best part is to travel you
know<00:05:29.600> sometimes<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.650> best<00:05:30.860> stories<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
year are the travel and the cool place

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.860 
year are the travel and the cool place

things we're here make the best of it we

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.970 
things we're here make the best of it we
always<00:05:38.660> try<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:38.930> get<00:05:39.170> out<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.560> find<00:05:39.590> those

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
always try to get out and find those

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.980 
always try to get out and find those
different<00:05:40.580> restaurants<00:05:41.060> not<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.270> Chili's<00:05:41.720> but

of being gone

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.480 
of being gone
it<00:05:47.570> also<00:05:47.720> just<00:05:48.020> gets<00:05:48.200> redundant<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:48.800> it's

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
it also just gets redundant and it's

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.770 
it also just gets redundant and it's

just the same thing over and over
obviously<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.830> racing<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.280> great<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.730> small
