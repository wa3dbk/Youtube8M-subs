00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
until that push one of the years or so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.830 
until that push one of the years or so
so<00:02:53.640> obviously<00:02:54.060> when<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.660> does<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so obviously when it does that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.510 
so obviously when it does that
classifies<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.770> going<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> wrong

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
classifies it going in the wrong

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.260 
classifies it going in the wrong
direction

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.610 

but<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.600> see<00:03:06.750> now<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.900> middle<00:03:07.350> bit<00:03:07.500> is

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
but you can see now the middle bit is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.440 
but you can see now the middle bit is
rising<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.540> ever<00:03:13.700> then<00:03:14.700> put<00:03:15.240> their

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
rising and then ever then put their

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:24.290 
rising and then ever then put their
sleeves<00:03:15.750> down<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:20.180> over<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:23.090> since<00:03:24.090> all

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
sleeves down the over there since all

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.420 
sleeves down the over there since all
now<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.020> go<00:03:25.170> off<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.950> takes<00:03:26.190> up

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
now is going to go off but that takes up

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:45.410 
now is going to go off but that takes up
food<00:03:26.700> forever<00:03:42.800> also<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.520> then<00:03:44.670> on<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:45.360> side

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
food forever also and then on this side

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.830 
food forever also and then on this side
for<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.230> flour<00:03:46.500> mill<00:03:46.790> where<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.880> point<00:03:48.150> push

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
for the flour mill where you point push

00:03:48.840 --> 00:04:04.780 
for the flour mill where you point push
the<00:03:48.959> thing<00:03:49.140> up<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:52.430> revolves<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> whole<00:03:53.700> thing

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.160 

so<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.000> very<00:04:06.300> lightest<00:04:06.690> heat<00:04:06.870> showing

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
so this is very lightest heat showing

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.170 
so this is very lightest heat showing
the<00:04:07.320> FN<00:04:07.770> sense<00:04:08.010> things<00:04:08.340> slow<00:04:08.550> bag<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:11.640> one<00:04:11.850> at

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the FN sense things slow bag but one at

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.300 
the FN sense things slow bag but one at
the<00:04:12.420> most<00:04:12.570> impressive<00:04:13.110> things<00:04:13.380> in<00:04:13.740> my<00:04:13.980> opinion

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the most impressive things in my opinion

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.699 
the most impressive things in my opinion
when<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.090> put<00:04:15.270> it<00:04:15.360> down<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.930> turn<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.560> motor

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
when you put it down and turn the motor

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:26.390 
when you put it down and turn the motor
on<00:04:18.049> find<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.200> switch<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.590> legs<00:04:25.860> at<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.130> site

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
on find the switch the legs at the site

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.450 
on find the switch the legs at the site
actually<00:04:27.470> start<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> come<00:04:28.800> out<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:28.950> art<00:04:31.460> which

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
actually start to come out on art which

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:41.540 
actually start to come out on art which
is<00:04:32.700> extremely<00:04:33.390> cool<00:04:38.420> but<00:04:39.420> then<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:41.310> push

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
is extremely cool but then I the push

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.980 
is extremely cool but then I the push
the<00:04:41.700> things<00:04:41.910> down<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.420> turn<00:04:42.540> these<00:04:42.720> little

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
the things down just turn these little

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.010 
the things down just turn these little
cogs<00:04:43.230> here<00:04:43.410> which<00:04:44.300> push-ups<00:04:45.300> now<00:04:45.360> obviously

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
cogs here which push-ups now obviously

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.390 
cogs here which push-ups now obviously
these<00:04:46.200> running<00:04:46.620> over<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.890> edge<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.100> these<00:04:47.250> we

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
these running over the edge of these we

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.240 
these running over the edge of these we
do<00:04:47.580> anything<00:04:51.560> but<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.710> can<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:52.950> how<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.040> goes

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
do anything but you can see how it goes

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.380 
do anything but you can see how it goes
down<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.570> sort<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.870> keeps<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.350> whole

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
down it just sort of keeps the whole

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:07.490 
down it just sort of keeps the whole
crane<00:04:57.390> sturdier<00:04:58.970> which<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.240> pretty<00:05:00.420> cool<00:05:06.500> so

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
crane sturdier which is pretty cool so

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.930 
crane sturdier which is pretty cool so
that's<00:05:07.950> all<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.670> sort<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.360> mechanic<00:05:09.780> things

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
that's all the sort of mechanic things

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.110 
that's all the sort of mechanic things
so<00:05:11.940> as<00:05:12.060> at<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.600> back<00:05:12.780> officers<00:05:13.430> erna<00:05:14.430> vez<00:05:14.610> em

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
so as at the back officers erna vez em

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.520 
so as at the back officers erna vez em
pep<00:05:15.810> another<00:05:16.620> two<00:05:16.830> pairs<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.280> wheels<00:05:18.320> but<00:05:19.320> then

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
pep another two pairs of wheels but then

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.060 
pep another two pairs of wheels but then
there's<00:05:19.740> also<00:05:19.830> this<00:05:20.160> thing<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:22.070> think

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
there's also this thing and I I think

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.470 
there's also this thing and I I think
I've<00:05:23.220> got<00:05:23.340> an<00:05:23.430> idea<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.790> what<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.360> I'm

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
I've got an idea of what it is but I'm

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.340 
I've got an idea of what it is but I'm
not<00:05:24.690> too<00:05:24.930> sure<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.580> if<00:05:26.910> anyone<00:05:27.360> can<00:05:27.540> up<00:05:27.630> all

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
not too sure so if anyone can up all

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.310 
not too sure so if anyone can up all
right<00:05:28.850> send<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:29.970> comment<00:05:30.180> say<00:05:30.690> what<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.140> is

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
right send a comment say what it is

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.440 
right send a comment say what it is
that'd<00:05:32.190> be<00:05:32.220> very<00:05:32.400> helpful<00:05:32.640> because<00:05:33.120> I'm<00:05:33.330> not

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
that'd be very helpful because I'm not

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.200 
that'd be very helpful because I'm not
too<00:05:34.320> sure<00:05:34.560> what<00:05:35.280> actually<00:05:35.640> is

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
too sure what actually is

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.160 
too sure what actually is
but<00:05:38.210> then<00:05:39.340> at<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.400> top<00:05:40.810> obviously<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.930> crane

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
but then at the top obviously the crane

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.060 
but then at the top obviously the crane
bit<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:43.160> this<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.550> methyl<00:05:44.030> best<00:05:44.240> bit<00:05:44.420> which<00:05:44.570> is

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
bit and this is methyl best bit which is

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.510 
bit and this is methyl best bit which is
pretty<00:05:46.070> nice<00:05:46.310> a<00:05:49.390> obviously<00:05:50.390> this<00:05:50.540> thing

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
pretty nice a obviously this thing

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.820 
pretty nice a obviously this thing
though<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.670> it<00:05:52.790> down<00:05:52.970> but<00:05:53.750> this<00:05:54.410> little<00:05:54.710> bit

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
though is it down but this little bit

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.100 
though is it down but this little bit
here<00:05:54.860> sort<00:05:55.340> of<00:05:55.400> stops<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:56.150> so<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:56.660> gotta<00:05:56.810> sort

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
here sort of stops it so you gotta sort

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.110 
here sort of stops it so you gotta sort
of<00:05:57.170> bring<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:57.800> round<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:58.610> it<00:05:58.670> doesn't<00:05:58.970> catch

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
of bring that round so it doesn't catch

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:09.660 
of bring that round so it doesn't catch
on<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:05.630> then<00:06:05.840> also<00:06:06.050> when<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:06.830> turn<00:06:07.010> this<00:06:07.250> bit

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.900 

the<00:06:10.670> whole<00:06:10.880> thing<00:06:11.150> actually<00:06:11.360> come<00:06:11.810> like

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
the whole thing actually come like

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.110 
the whole thing actually come like
extends<00:06:13.910> out<00:06:15.040> which<00:06:16.040> is<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.310> mobile<00:06:16.880> cool

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
extends out which is a mobile cool

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.660 
extends out which is a mobile cool
feature<00:06:21.970> so<00:06:22.970> yeah<00:06:23.180> this<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:23.780> an<00:06:24.050> absolutely

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
feature so yeah this is an absolutely

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.820 
feature so yeah this is an absolutely
brilliant<00:06:25.670> set<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:26.720> you<00:06:26.900> can't<00:06:27.170> afford<00:06:27.290> it

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
brilliant set and if you can't afford it

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.770 
brilliant set and if you can't afford it
because<00:06:28.010> it<00:06:28.220> is<00:06:28.310> quite<00:06:28.550> expensive<00:06:28.760> I<00:06:29.300> would

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
because it is quite expensive I would

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.880
