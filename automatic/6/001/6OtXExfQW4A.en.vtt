 recipe for you 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.200
 today we are going to make a loaf of bread 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.390
 different from that of other 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.640
 bread of milk that I have already passed to you 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.400
 and if any salty syndileitis has received 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.710
 many requests to make 11 salty and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.419
 if it is easy and pretty fast to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:42.350
 to do you will see 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:44.180
 we'll use here an egg beaten to 6 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.449
 tablespoons milk powder 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.449
 skimmed 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.360
 we just mix it up from here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 after mixing I'll put two 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 tablespoons liquid milk 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 skimmed and I will mix again 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:32.000
 after mixing well our will stay 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:36.650
 so a mass presentation even and I 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:48.020
 I'm going to put my chemical ferment with 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:50.450
 a pinch of salt and how to mix it well 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.710
 mixed the consistency of it will be 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.880
 that even a way to return Opel 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:04.160
 silicone to take the liner and I'll 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.670
 split the dough with 12 make two 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.670
 buns 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.959
 There you pick up the hand. 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.320
 I left it well round and put your 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.320
 people 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.980
 you can do is smaller and do more 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.180
 quantities also that still goes 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.180
 grow in the oven 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.160
 you put the taste of the other they will 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 grow so as not to run the risk of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.020
 grab and now I'll take it to the oven 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 preheated to 180 degrees by 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.400
 approximately 15 minutes but that's what 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.130
 I always said keep an eye on that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.750
 depends on theft and the fire is ready 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.330
 the boot to show the state I do not want 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 with 15 minutes later is that our 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.940

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.180
 trend
