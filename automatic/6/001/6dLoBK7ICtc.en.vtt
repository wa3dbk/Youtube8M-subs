00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.910 

want<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.319> demonstrate<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.510> plane<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.540> made<00:00:03.920> this

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
want to demonstrate a plane I made this

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.020 
want to demonstrate a plane I made this
is<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> foam<00:00:05.490> board<00:00:05.790> glider<00:00:07.550> I've<00:00:08.550> only<00:00:08.790> made

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
is a foam board glider I've only made

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.749 
is a foam board glider I've only made
two<00:00:09.360> planes<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:10.440> life<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
two planes in my life and this is the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
two planes in my life and this is the
second<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:13.230> reason<00:00:13.469> why<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> decided<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
second one the reason why I decided to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.029 
second one the reason why I decided to
make<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:15.059> many<00:00:15.990> people<00:00:16.410> make<00:00:16.560> planes<00:00:16.859> out

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
make this is many people make planes out

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.670 
make this is many people make planes out
of<00:00:17.160> foam<00:00:17.340> board<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.330> I've<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.109> rare<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
of foam board but I've it's it's rare to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.370 
of foam board but I've it's it's rare to
find<00:00:19.830> someone<00:00:20.400> make<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.020> glider

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
find someone make one that's a glider

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.150 
find someone make one that's a glider
and<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.369> always<00:00:23.519> wondered<00:00:24.000> why<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.130> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and I always wondered why this one is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.599 
and I always wondered why this one is
five<00:00:26.699> feet<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.529> wingspan<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.949> five<00:00:29.310> feet<00:00:29.550> long

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
five feet the wingspan is five feet long

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.650 
five feet the wingspan is five feet long
and<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.289> always<00:00:32.009> wondered<00:00:32.489> maybe<00:00:32.640> maybe<00:00:33.329> no<00:00:33.540> one

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and I always wondered maybe maybe no one

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
and I always wondered maybe maybe no one
really<00:00:33.960> tries<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> wing<00:00:34.950> isn't

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
really tries it because the wing isn't

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.030 
really tries it because the wing isn't
strong<00:00:35.520> enough<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.000> will<00:00:36.090> bend<00:00:36.540> break<00:00:37.010> what<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
strong enough it will bend break what I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.030 
strong enough it will bend break what I
did<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:39.030> between<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> wing<00:00:39.800> from<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
did was in between the wing from this

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
did was in between the wing from this
joint<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.040> put<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> balsa<00:00:44.610> rod<00:00:45.020> piece<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
joint to here I put a balsa rod piece of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.910 
joint to here I put a balsa rod piece of
wood<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:48.230> from<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.149> put<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.920> foam

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
wood and from here to here I put a foam

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.290 
wood and from here to here I put a foam
board<00:00:53.160> joiner<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> probably<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
board joiner and probably can see it I

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.340 
board joiner and probably can see it I
don't<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> could<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.170> there

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
don't know if you could see it in there

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
don't know if you could see it in there
but<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.309> guess<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.120> trying<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.420> say<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
but I guess what I'm trying to say is it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.979 
but I guess what I'm trying to say is it
it<00:01:01.140> flies<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.859> lot<00:01:02.850> better<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.539> thought<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it flies a lot better than I thought it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
it flies a lot better than I thought it
would<00:01:04.140> um<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:05.189> light<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> whenever<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
would um it's light so whenever you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
would um it's light so whenever you
build<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.290> plane<00:01:07.530> there's<00:01:07.740> things<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> learn

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
build a plane there's things you learn

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
build a plane there's things you learn
you<00:01:08.430> should<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.729> done<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.110> should

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you should have done one thing I should

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
you should have done one thing I should
have<00:01:10.470> done<00:01:10.650> differently<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> nose

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
have done differently was make this nose

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.039 
have done differently was make this nose
longer<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.110> reason<00:01:13.439> why<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.900> wind<00:01:15.900> up

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
longer the reason why is I wind up

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
longer the reason why is I wind up
having<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> put<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> heavy<00:01:17.570> 2200<00:01:18.570> milliamp

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
having to put this heavy 2200 milliamp

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649 
having to put this heavy 2200 milliamp
battery<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> LED<00:01:21.420> weight

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
battery in it and also this LED weight

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.380 
battery in it and also this LED weight
from<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> truck<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.670> didn't<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
from a truck if I didn't do that it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
from a truck if I didn't do that it
would<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.229> wouldn't<00:01:25.530> fly<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.299> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
would it wouldn't fly it would just be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.899 
would it wouldn't fly it would just be
very<00:01:27.630> uncontrolled<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
very uncontrolled and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.289 
very uncontrolled and
I<00:01:30.649> think<00:01:31.649> what<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:31.890> gonna<00:01:32.039> do<00:01:32.250> next<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.759> extend

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I think what I'm gonna do next is extend

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
I think what I'm gonna do next is extend
the<00:01:33.420> nose<00:01:33.630> maybe<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> long<00:01:34.820> make<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the nose maybe to this long make it that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
the nose maybe to this long make it that
maybe<00:01:36.270> add<00:01:36.479> four<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:36.899> five<00:01:37.110> inches<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:38.220> way<00:01:38.399> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
maybe add four or five inches that way I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
maybe add four or five inches that way I
can<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> smaller<00:01:39.149> battery<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
can use a smaller battery make it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.450 
can use a smaller battery make it
lighter<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.470> glide<00:01:40.799> further<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.780> yeah

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
lighter and glide further and on yeah

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
lighter and glide further and on yeah
the<00:01:44.460> tail<00:01:44.719> this<00:01:45.719> part<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> only<00:01:46.350> part<00:01:46.560> not

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the tail this part is the only part not

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.380 
the tail this part is the only part not
made<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.340> foam<00:01:47.490> board<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> made<00:01:48.210> out

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
made out of foam board this is made out

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.770 
made out of foam board this is made out
of<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:49.399> coroplast<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> plastic

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of all coroplast it's like a plastic

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.950 
of all coroplast it's like a plastic
cardboard<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:53.060> used<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.600> was

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
cardboard I used it because I was

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.899 
cardboard I used it because I was
wondering<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.799> maybe<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> gonna

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
wondering if maybe that this is gonna

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.669 
wondering if maybe that this is gonna
take<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.450> force<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> turn<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.439> every

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
take a lot of force to turn to every

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.819 
take a lot of force to turn to every
plane<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.539> I<00:02:00.539> reckon<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.530> stiffer

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
plane so I reckon this would be stiffer

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.539 
plane so I reckon this would be stiffer
and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.970> between<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.770> two<00:02:04.770> bamboo

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and I put in between it two bamboo

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.160 
and I put in between it two bamboo
skewers<00:02:06.179> running<00:02:06.750> down<00:02:08.119> inside<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.420> that's
