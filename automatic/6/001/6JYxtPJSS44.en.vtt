make sure the fit sir character and the
character<00:05:09.950> controller<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.960> way<00:05:12.620> to

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
character controller is a way to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.000 
character controller is a way to
actually<00:05:12.980> resize<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.910> reposition<00:05:14.090> this

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
actually resize and reposition this

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.950 
actually resize and reposition this
radius<00:05:16.010> is<00:05:16.790> how<00:05:17.330> will<00:05:17.480> pretty<00:05:17.630> much<00:05:17.720> how<00:05:17.930> I

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
radius is how will pretty much how I

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.880 
radius is how will pretty much how I
your<00:05:18.380> character<00:05:18.710> is<00:05:18.860> basically<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:21.590> as<00:05:21.770> you

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
your character is basically so as you

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.280 
your character is basically so as you
can<00:05:21.980> see<00:05:22.450> two<00:05:23.450> hands<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:23.930> word<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.860> answer<00:05:25.220> and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
can see two hands and word to answer and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.810 
can see two hands and word to answer and
height<00:05:27.290> is<00:05:27.470> how<00:05:27.620> tall<00:05:27.860> your<00:05:27.980> character<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.540> and

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
height is how tall your character is and

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.710 
height is how tall your character is and
this<00:05:31.820> is<00:05:32.620> repositioning<00:05:34.420> so<00:05:35.420> you're<00:05:35.570> going<00:05:35.660> to

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
this is repositioning so you're going to

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:50.850 
this is repositioning so you're going to
reposition<00:05:36.080> this<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:39.080> too<00:05:39.290> high<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.470> little<00:05:39.710> bit

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.790 

and<00:05:51.430> if<00:05:51.759> we<00:05:52.000> move<00:05:52.180> it<00:05:52.300> up<00:05:54.090> voila<00:05:55.409> our<00:05:56.409> green

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
and if we move it up voila our green

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.899 
and if we move it up voila our green
thing<00:05:57.330> surrounds<00:05:58.330> our<00:05:58.560> character<00:05:59.849> just<00:06:00.849> like

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
thing surrounds our character just like

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.659 
thing surrounds our character just like
