I'll do is we'll take my little Buffy
here<00:01:05.320> here<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.030> basically<00:01:07.030> it'll<00:01:07.869> do<00:01:08.049> just<00:01:08.290> go

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
here here and basically it'll do just go

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.710 
here here and basically it'll do just go
over<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.710> area<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.250> when<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:10.270> compound

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
over the area and when the compound

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.930 
over the area and when the compound
itself<00:01:11.049> after<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.470> heat<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.010> compound<00:01:12.820> will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
itself after the heat the compound will

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.210 
itself after the heat the compound will
actually<00:01:13.270> dry<00:01:13.450> out<00:01:13.480> so<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:13.870> do<00:01:13.930> have<00:01:14.170> some<00:01:14.230> spray

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
actually dry out so I do have some spray

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually dry out so I do have some spray
water<00:01:15.460> here<00:01:15.790> just<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.090> spray<00:01:16.330> on<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> surface

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
water here just to spray on the surface

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.690 
water here just to spray on the surface
here<00:01:17.080> actually<00:01:17.230> just<00:01:17.410> might<00:01:17.650> spray<00:01:18.520> some

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
here actually just might spray some

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.040 
here actually just might spray some
lightly<00:01:18.910> on<00:01:19.210> there<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.780> give<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
lightly on there just to give it a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.050 
lightly on there just to give it a
little<00:01:20.170> more<00:01:20.380> lubrication<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.250> actually<00:01:21.580> it

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
little more lubrication so actually it

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.630 
little more lubrication so actually it
does<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> nicer<00:01:22.510> job<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.870> polishing

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.460 

now<00:01:32.510> what<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.750> want<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:32.960> do<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.140> actually<00:01:33.260> be

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
now what you want to do is actually be

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.720 
now what you want to do is actually be
careful<00:01:33.800> on<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.950> edges<00:01:34.160> here<00:01:34.340> because<00:01:34.640> you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
careful on the edges here because you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.240 
careful on the edges here because you
can<00:01:35.030> burn<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.540> paint<00:01:35.720> away<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.250> which

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
can burn the paint away and which

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.350 
can burn the paint away and which
actually<00:01:37.520> won't<00:01:37.640> look<00:01:37.700> too<00:01:37.850> nice

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
actually won't look too nice

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.820 
actually won't look too nice
after<00:01:38.720> removing<00:01:39.020> scratches<00:01:39.470> we'll<00:01:39.620> end<00:01:39.800> up

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
after removing scratches we'll end up

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.390 
after removing scratches we'll end up
having<00:01:39.890> some<00:01:40.340> spots<00:01:41.240> where<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:42.100> inner<00:01:43.100> side

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
having some spots where the inner side

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.910 
having some spots where the inner side
material<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.910> showing

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.140 

as<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.040> can<00:01:54.190> see<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> scratches<00:01:54.790> are<00:01:54.909> coming

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
as you can see the scratches are coming

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.930 
as you can see the scratches are coming
out<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.390> surface<00:01:55.750> here<00:01:55.930> slowly<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:57.430> after

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
out of the surface here slowly now after

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.360 
out of the surface here slowly now after
sometime<00:01:58.270> buffing<00:01:58.659> with<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.370> polishing

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
sometime buffing with the polishing

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.040 
sometime buffing with the polishing
compound<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:00.970> want<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.240> switch<00:02:01.450> over<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.780> this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
compound you want to switch over to this

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.770 
compound you want to switch over to this
scratch<00:02:02.860> remover<00:02:03.310> which<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.580> have<00:02:03.760> here<00:02:04.180> which
