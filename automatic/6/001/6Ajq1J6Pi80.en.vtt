00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.580
 the guys here agents is cool and talks 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 as with this new video on the channel 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 of the cian obviously I bring you this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 very fast core we say yes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.789
 quite fast it is done in 91 seconds 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 dream how can I see with trap 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.969
 the only two features that it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.500
 make it pretty cute are that first 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.960
 is not the is not a complete group like 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.250
 you can see there will be an ally 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.739
 moron who entered so randomly 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 in fact we were in five group will render 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.289
 so in the manner of c there is perhaps a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.329
 a little apple will slow down anyway I have it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 killed so he deserved it must not 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 to come in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 that bad person anyway 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 you can also see for yourself then it's done 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.160
 quite fast 91 seconds can be said 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 yes it is nothing practically me 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.500
 they wanted to excuse this inactivity 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.210
 that there was during all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 this time I was not present 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.310
 I think you know, I think you know 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.740
 reasons if you don't know what I say or 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.710
 school is always more or less like this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.860
 practically 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.500
 it is not that I was going badly and that it is so 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.050
 in short you know from the school and the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.030
 school anyway I think it's stage 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.820
 the client finished if you don't look at him 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.520
 and I am very happy to return to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.259

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.040
 gameplay that can be enough 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.330
 cute I hope you like it indeed it is 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:55.000
