00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
put a list below but you should just
have<00:01:51.599> snot<00:01:51.869> face<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.349> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.709> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
have snot face because I think it's a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.399 
have snot face because I think it's a
permanent<00:01:53.759> color<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.209> look<00:01:54.810> how<00:01:54.959> pretty<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
permanent color and look how pretty it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.630 
permanent color and look how pretty it
is<00:01:59.179> so<00:02:00.179> that's<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:01.079> over<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.349> lid

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
is so that's just going all over the lid

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.649 
is so that's just going all over the lid
and<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.619> up<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.610> crease<00:02:05.879> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> inner

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and then up into the crease in the inner

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.029 
and then up into the crease in the inner
corner<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.289> I'll<00:02:07.349> probably<00:02:07.530> need<00:02:07.709> some<00:02:07.770> more

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
corner and I'll probably need some more

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.360 
corner and I'll probably need some more
color<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.269> inner<00:02:12.510> crease<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.470> going

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
color so on your inner crease it's going

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
color so on your inner crease it's going
there

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:34.250 

also<00:02:20.130> using<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> edge<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.300> brush

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.770 

so<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.890> definitely<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:36.629> we're
