00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.700
 20 years have passed since 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.240
 What I complained most 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.789
 Desertification is a new ozone hole is found to proceed over Antarctica the Hona now 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.350
 Street in the drain and refugees 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.829
 People in slums 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:40.700
 I can not afford a little life now 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:48.790
 If it compares with the photograph about 20 years ago that appears in a textbook 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.790
 I think that your efforts have improved a little, but there has been no major progress 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:01.330
 Is there still 20 years ago band appeal in your ears ? 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.990
 We will change to four times that of 20 years ago if you're got faded if 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.990
 Appeals 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:17.650
 Not only you, but all adults will surrender society to our generation 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:24.970
 Until that day you have the baton of society 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.360
 Our starting line is determined by how much you can solve the current environmental problems now 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 I will 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.650
 If customer can solve it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.330
 It is only from us where we are good 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.330
 If I can solve it only a little 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.540
 Without Dasa ran toward the diffuser char seen Wan Di from the more bad location becomes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.659
 not 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.900
 At worst it is that we begin to run 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.130
 Our children grandchildren 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:02.550
 It may have an adverse effect on the great-grandchildren's generation 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:07.880
 So please face this problem more seriously than ever 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.880
 The future of us and their offspring also rests 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.130
 We are children so we have no social power or financial ability 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 I can not do large-scale things alone 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 But eco- friendly can be done 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.630
 Stop the cooler and turn it into a fan 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:38.960
 God uses Aratani recycled paper for advertising 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.250
 Variety there should be or the like can reduce the co2 least to the time of incineration of leftovers 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.710
 is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.010
 I try as much as possible 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.430
 in addition 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.210
 If one person can not do it but do it with the number of people 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.069
 You can also wear a kimono 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:03.909
 You can also Chiba size also Do eco 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:03.909
 In addition , you can also indirectly take out the mother line such as afforestation from spending money 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:16.319
 Adults, on the other hand, have both social and financial strength 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 Of course Eco of the scale that even a child can do 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.110
 If united 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.330
 Global activities are also possible 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:32.020
 So people all over the world share the will to protect the earth 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.020
 If it cooperates, the earth will surely become a wonderful star 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.390
 I 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 I want to know what the future that others want 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:47.549
 Ota I asked some people, children and men and women 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.350
 You can do this with a few youtube win one 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.750
 Because I thought it would be better if 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.060
 The most common was 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.280
 Future that is not plagued by everyone is doing in poverty and above 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.610
 Also 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:10.870
 Future marks can be immediately resolved there if not of every war and conflict 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.870
 And it was a future that coexists and plays with creatures 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.590
 Future seems with their children was good to have been born on the earth in the adult 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:28.139
 Some people answered that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.139
 I sincerely hope for the future to draw a positive story of the earth 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.410
 It is a single planet Earth's life star 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.240
 We do not want to make our earth, which is irreplaceable, a star 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.240
 We think 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.070
 War on this planet 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.090
 Poverty because 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:58.760
 Depletion of extinct resources of organisms 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:02.770
 I want this is to build all of the future of free bright ideal environmental issues 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.770
 We hope for two days 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 We are to believe cheer everyone like those who are who are working every day to improve the planet called Earth 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.030
 Thank you very much
