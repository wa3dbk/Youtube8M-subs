00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
there now what you're going to see

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.670 
there now what you're going to see
inside<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.019> cylinder<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
inside here this is the the cylinder and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.910 
inside here this is the the cylinder and
as<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.640> turn<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> flywheel<00:01:06.439> it's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> inside

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
as we turn the flywheel it's the inside

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
as we turn the flywheel it's the inside
the<00:01:08.070> cylinder<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> piston<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.770> goes

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the cylinder that's the piston that goes

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
the cylinder that's the piston that goes
up<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.900> got

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
up and down and then over here we've got

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
up and down and then over here we've got
valves<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.540> intake<00:01:16.500> valve<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
valves the the intake valve is here the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
valves the the intake valve is here the
exhaust<00:01:18.299> valve<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> reason<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
exhaust valve is here the reason this is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.910 
exhaust valve is here the reason this is
an<00:01:20.040> intake<00:01:20.369> valve<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
an intake valve is because with the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
an intake valve is because with the
carburetor<00:01:23.220> mounted<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> side<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
carburetor mounted on this side of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.429 
carburetor mounted on this side of the
engine<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.409> gasoline<00:01:26.090> enters<00:01:27.259> through<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
engine the gasoline enters through this

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
engine the gasoline enters through this
tube<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:32.030> into<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.840> cylinder<00:01:35.360> through

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
tube and then into the cylinder through

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.410 
tube and then into the cylinder through
this<00:01:36.479> valve<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> valve<00:01:37.470> opens<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.420> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this valve when the valve opens and of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
this valve when the valve opens and of
course<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> exhaust<00:01:40.530> valve<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
course this is the exhaust valve and the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
course this is the exhaust valve and the
exhaust<00:01:42.840> from<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> engine<00:01:43.619> goes<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
exhaust from the engine goes out that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.319 
exhaust from the engine goes out that
way<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:46.590> through<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> muffler<00:01:47.430> I've

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
way and out through the muffler I've

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.700 
way and out through the muffler I've
loosened<00:01:48.540> them<00:01:48.840> off<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> ref<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.590> bit

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
loosened them off the ref a little bit

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.889 
loosened them off the ref a little bit
here<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:51.860> see<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
here you see here this is where the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
here you see here this is where the
exhaust<00:01:55.380> comes<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> engine

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
exhaust comes out so the way the engine

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.429 
exhaust comes out so the way the engine
works<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:05.130> engine<00:02:05.399> starts<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:07.170> this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
works is the engine starts in this

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.430 
works is the engine starts in this
position<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.580> engine<00:02:11.580> spins

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
position and then as the engine spins

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.240 
position and then as the engine spins
the<00:02:14.440> intake<00:02:14.890> valve<00:02:15.190> opens<00:02:15.880> up<00:02:17.250> allows

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the intake valve opens up allows

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.050 
the intake valve opens up allows
gasoline<00:02:19.770> into<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.950> chamber<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
gasoline into the chamber so as the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.820 
gasoline into the chamber so as the
piston<00:02:23.760> moves<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:25.030> into<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.480> cylinder<00:02:25.990> it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
piston moves down into the cylinder it

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
piston moves down into the cylinder it
sucks<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.490> gasoline<00:02:27.970> into<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
sucks the gasoline into it and then this

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.180 
sucks the gasoline into it and then this
valve<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.290> intake<00:02:32.650> valve<00:02:32.970> closes<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
valve the intake valve closes and the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.350 
valve the intake valve closes and the
gasoline<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.180> now<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.810> cylinder

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
gasoline that is now in this cylinder

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.600 
gasoline that is now in this cylinder
compresses<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.860> piston<00:02:42.220> comes<00:02:42.370> up

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
compresses as the piston comes up

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.420 
compresses as the piston comes up
squeeze<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.270> really<00:02:43.540> tight<00:02:43.780> inside<00:02:44.430> inside

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
squeeze is really tight inside inside

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.680 
squeeze is really tight inside inside
here<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.130> called<00:02:48.400> top<00:02:48.730> dead<00:02:49.060> center<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
here this is called top dead center of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.070 
here this is called top dead center of
the<00:02:50.020> compression<00:02:50.410> stroke<00:02:51.600> now<00:02:52.600> all<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.990> this

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the compression stroke now all of this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770 
the compression stroke now all of this
gas<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.590> compressed<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.250> here<00:02:54.550> at<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:55.450> moment

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
gas is compressed in here at that moment

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.960 
gas is compressed in here at that moment
is<00:02:56.200> when<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:57.490> spark<00:02:57.850> plug<00:02:58.350> sparks<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.940> ignite

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
is when the spark plug sparks to ignite

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.060 
is when the spark plug sparks to ignite
that<00:03:01.270> gasoline<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.730> bang<00:03:04.440> small<00:03:05.440> explosions

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
that gasoline and bang small explosions

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.380 
that gasoline and bang small explosions
out<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:06.610> forces<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.750> piston<00:03:08.140> back<00:03:08.410> down

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
out here forces that piston back down

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.280 
out here forces that piston back down
and<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:11.830> when<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.460> gets<00:03:12.610> down<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.970> bottom

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and then when it gets down to the bottom

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.650 
and then when it gets down to the bottom
the<00:03:14.290> other<00:03:14.560> valve<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.520> exhaust<00:03:15.880> valve<00:03:16.150> opens

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
the other valve the exhaust valve opens

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.760 
the other valve the exhaust valve opens
back<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.380> as<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.310> piston<00:03:19.350> Rises<00:03:20.350> back<00:03:20.710> up

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
back up and as the piston Rises back up

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.390 
back up and as the piston Rises back up
it<00:03:21.130> pushes<00:03:21.460> that<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.690> burned<00:03:23.080> fuel<00:03:23.440> out<00:03:24.340> of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
it pushes that then burned fuel out of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.930 
it pushes that then burned fuel out of
the<00:03:24.670> exhaust<00:03:25.150> valve<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:27.400> through<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the exhaust valve out through the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.410 
the exhaust valve out through the
muffler<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.110> then<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.100> system<00:03:30.490> starts<00:03:31.270> all

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
muffler and then the system starts all

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.950 
muffler and then the system starts all
over<00:03:31.450> again

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
over again

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.100 
over again
so<00:03:32.830> stroke<00:03:33.580> one<00:03:35.100> intake<00:03:36.100> valve<00:03:36.340> opens<00:03:37.110> suck

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
so stroke one intake valve opens suck

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.850 
so stroke one intake valve opens suck
the<00:03:38.260> gas<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:39.060> stroke<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:41.580> piston<00:03:42.630> rises<00:03:43.630> up

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
the gas in stroke to piston rises up

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.630 
the gas in stroke to piston rises up
compresses<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:44.980> gasoline<00:03:46.110> stroke<00:03:47.110> three

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
compresses the gasoline stroke three

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.990 
compresses the gasoline stroke three
spark<00:03:48.640> plug<00:03:48.880> ignites<00:03:49.560> bang<00:03:50.880> pushes<00:03:51.880> the

valve<00:03:56.200> opens<00:03:56.590> up<00:03:57.060> piston<00:03:58.060> comes<00:03:58.240> back<00:03:58.480> up<00:03:58.720> for

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
valve opens up piston comes back up for

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.790 
valve opens up piston comes back up for
the<00:03:58.990> last<00:03:59.230> time

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
the last time

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.770 
the last time
pushes<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.640> exhaust<00:04:00.940> fumes<00:04:01.120> out<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.540> that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
pushes the exhaust fumes out of that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.740 
pushes the exhaust fumes out of that
valve<00:04:02.050> both<00:04:03.040> valves<00:04:03.310> close<00:04:03.610> back<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.240> then

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
valve both valves close back and then

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.040 
valve both valves close back and then
the<00:04:05.680> system<00:04:06.070> starts<00:04:06.340> all<00:04:06.580> over<00:04:06.910> again<00:04:07.120> that's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
the system starts all over again that's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.610 
the system starts all over again that's
why<00:04:08.350> it's<00:04:08.470> called<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.740> four-stroke<00:04:09.130> engine

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
why it's called the four-stroke engine

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.310 
why it's called the four-stroke engine
now<00:04:11.620> if<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:11.860> take<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.010> look<00:04:12.190> at<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.430> side<00:04:12.670> here

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
now if you take a look at the side here

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.920 
now if you take a look at the side here
over<00:04:14.320> here<00:04:14.530> are<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> valve

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
over here are the this is the valve

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.490 
over here are the this is the valve
cover<00:04:17.290> these<00:04:17.980> are<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.250> valves<00:04:18.430> in<00:04:18.670> here<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
cover these are the valves in here and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.910 
cover these are the valves in here and
you'll<00:04:20.739> see<00:04:20.950> as<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.150> turn<00:04:22.390> this<00:04:22.890> each<00:04:23.890> valve

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
you'll see as we turn this each valve

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.100 
you'll see as we turn this each valve
opens<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.310> closes<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.540> what<00:04:26.660> pulls<00:04:26.960> it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
opens and closes and what pulls it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.170 
opens and closes and what pulls it
closed<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> tension<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.000> spring<00:04:31.180> and

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
closed is the tension of the spring and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.520 
closed is the tension of the spring and
as<00:04:32.450> you've<00:04:32.660> seen<00:04:32.810> in<00:04:32.990> some<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.260> my<00:04:33.380> other

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
as you've seen in some of my other

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.690 
as you've seen in some of my other
videos<00:04:34.600> they<00:04:35.600> replace<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.140> valve<00:04:36.580> take<00:04:37.580> it

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
videos they replace the valve take it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.890 
videos they replace the valve take it
apart<00:04:37.940> together<00:04:38.210> you've<00:04:38.390> got<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.600> springs

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
apart together you've got the springs

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.870 
apart together you've got the springs
out<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.170> there<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.520> now<00:04:41.000> what<00:04:41.180> I'm<00:04:41.270> gonna<00:04:41.360> do

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
out of there so now what I'm gonna do

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.700 
out of there so now what I'm gonna do
take<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.000> bottom<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.450> engine<00:04:44.840> off<00:04:44.960> and

take the bottom of this engine off and

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.130 
take the bottom of this engine off and
we'll<00:04:45.830> show<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.010> what's<00:04:46.250> going<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.550> inside

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
we'll show you what's going on inside

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.190 
we'll show you what's going on inside
all<00:04:48.140> right<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.300> engine<00:04:50.630> when<00:04:51.050> it's

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
all right this is the engine when it's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.470 
all right this is the engine when it's
been<00:04:51.350> opened<00:04:51.650> up<00:04:52.060> let's<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.180> here's<00:04:53.420> the

and<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.430> showed<00:04:58.670> you<00:04:59.200> here<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.380> valves<00:05:00.740> are<00:05:01.240> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
and I showed you here the valves are and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.940 
and I showed you here the valves are and
the<00:05:02.480> valve<00:05:02.660> cover<00:05:02.990> would<00:05:03.230> normally<00:05:03.740> cover

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
the valve cover would normally cover

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.310 
the valve cover would normally cover
this<00:05:04.160> up<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.670> it's<00:05:05.210> wide<00:05:05.360> open<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.080> see

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
this up and it's wide open but you see

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.390 
this up and it's wide open but you see

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
on the inside of the engine there are

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.760 
on the inside of the engine there are
these<00:05:10.520> little<00:05:10.930> metal<00:05:11.930> plungers

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
these little metal plungers

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.270 
these little metal plungers
they're<00:05:13.280> called<00:05:13.520> tappets<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.980> they<00:05:15.980> sit

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
they're called tappets and they sit

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.980 
they're called tappets and they sit
inside<00:05:17.320> one<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.710> exhaust<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:20.060> one<00:05:20.750> on<00:05:20.900> the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
inside one on the exhaust and one on the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.810 
inside one on the exhaust and one on the
intake<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:25.090> crank<00:05:26.090> and<00:05:27.820> that's

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
intake and this is the crank and that's

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.920 
intake and this is the crank and that's
what<00:05:29.120> powers<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.810> piston<00:05:30.200> going<00:05:30.440> up<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.800> down

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
what powers the piston going up and down

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.260 
what powers the piston going up and down
now<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:32.990> timing<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.620> this<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:33.860> done<00:05:34.310> by<00:05:35.210> these

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
now the timing of this is done by these

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.800 
now the timing of this is done by these
gears<00:05:35.930> this<00:05:36.440> gear<00:05:36.800> here<00:05:37.070> has<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.850> small<00:05:38.270> dot<00:05:38.570> on

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
gears this gear here has a small dot on

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.590 
gears this gear here has a small dot on
it<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:40.310> is<00:05:40.370> called<00:05:40.730> the<00:05:40.820> cam<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.450> if

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
it and this is called the cam and if

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.670 
it and this is called the cam and if
you'll<00:05:41.810> notice<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.230> cam<00:05:42.530> has<00:05:44.410> bumps<00:05:45.410> on<00:05:45.560> it

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you'll notice the cam has bumps on it

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.600 
you'll notice the cam has bumps on it
that<00:05:46.040> are<00:05:46.190> offset<00:05:46.400> from<00:05:46.790> each<00:05:47.120> other<00:05:47.360> these

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
that are offset from each other these

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.390 
that are offset from each other these
bumps<00:05:49.870> actually<00:05:50.870> press<00:05:51.410> on<00:05:51.650> these<00:05:51.770> tappets

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
bumps actually press on these tappets

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.530 
bumps actually press on these tappets
and<00:05:52.960> as<00:05:53.960> this<00:05:54.440> spins<00:05:54.800> around<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:56.060> is<00:05:56.300> what

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
and as this spins around that is what

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.070 
and as this spins around that is what
actually<00:05:56.690> pushes<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.410> valves<00:05:58.310> open<00:05:58.460> at<00:05:59.120> the

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
actually pushes the valves open at the

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.910 
actually pushes the valves open at the
correct<00:06:00.590> moment<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:01.220> it<00:06:01.370> needs<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.640> be<00:06:01.790> open

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
correct moment that it needs to be open

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.940 
correct moment that it needs to be open
there's<00:06:03.920> a<00:06:03.980> small<00:06:04.280> dot<00:06:04.550> on<00:06:04.580> this<00:06:04.940> gear<00:06:05.330> and
