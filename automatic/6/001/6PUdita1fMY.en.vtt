over for a snack and it was he was
pretty<00:00:41.309> good<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.030> impressed<00:00:42.180> with

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
pretty good I was pretty impressed with

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.450 
pretty good I was pretty impressed with
it<00:00:42.629> i<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.809> i<00:00:43.379> might<00:00:43.890> try<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> start<00:00:44.340> making

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it i think i might try and start making

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100 
it i think i might try and start making
those<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.879> home<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.600> probably

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
those at home or something but probably

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
those at home or something but probably
will<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> same

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.930 

Oh<00:00:51.500> Paul<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> best<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> uh<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.850> know

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Oh Paul the best is uh you know

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
Oh Paul the best is uh you know
obviously<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.600> said<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> good

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
obviously like I said go into a good

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
obviously like I said go into a good
team<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.399> cool<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
team that's pretty cool and you get a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
team that's pretty cool and you get a
chance<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> meet<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> new<00:00:58.620> guys<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
chance to meet to a lot of new guys and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
chance to meet to a lot of new guys and
then<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.340> guess<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.780> opposite<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
then I guess the opposite of that the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
then I guess the opposite of that the
worst<00:01:01.260> part<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> having<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.070> happen<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> leave

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
worst part is having to happen to leave

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
worst part is having to happen to leave
all<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.120> buddies<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.570> um<00:01:04.400> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
all your buddies and um it's a bit of a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
all your buddies and um it's a bit of a
hassle<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.330> few<00:01:06.479> weeks<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.840> moving

hassle the first few weeks just moving

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
hassle the first few weeks just moving
stuff<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.770> moving<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.520> vehicle<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.090> all
