00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 is what is inside 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.960
 I think you're not going to see me during 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.680
 the video but it does not matter 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.680
 let's remove this 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.010
 things 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.970

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.550

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.550
 first thing as no 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.460
 book 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:15.070
 of art up to 54 also in hardcover 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 with all the illustrations in look 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 esther you 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.450
 of the landscapes and of all the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.450
 everyone 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.220
 leave here to talk 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.220
 let's see 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 an envelope 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.830
 the cards 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.400
 and add 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.400
 maximum 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.750
 here 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.200
 to see what we have so that we have the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.200
 game 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.400
 the metal capsule that can not miss 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.400
 in these directions as you can see 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.970
 but no 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.090
 well the soundtrack of the game 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 plus 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000
 power 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.230
 go go 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:48.100
 a couple of pictures literally 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 we have killer and ship pictures 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.640
 and this is a pirate flag 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 also almost entirely 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.950
 and effectively a mega pirate flag 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.950
 I do not know where you can hang this 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.180
 I can not even the camera or even the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.590
 table but you are watching 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 my mother 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.519
 We are going to be 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.879
 I will not send them again to leave it 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.879
 here 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:41.030
 there is not so much space and now we are going 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.030
 to see how we do because the figure 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.910
 mega impressive figure 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 but 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.510
 look 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.510
 the figure that must be assembled 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.010
 and everything assembled this is making a 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.010
 group madness but it does not matter 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.199
 good the case that you can see part of the 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.639
 figure is worth it still remains as 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.830
 assemble the figure is impressive not 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.060
 have 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.420
 it has no other definition 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.990
 was missing 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.990
 nothing 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.160
 the rope is also full of 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.830
 small details 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:45.490
 and already to finish this mega a boxing 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.509
 we found the treasure map 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.509
 with your successes 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.110
 that we are going to speak directly 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.110
 well why 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.320
 here we are 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.940
 Well, all this is what the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.750
 special edition of assassin's 4 like 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.160
 you can see there are many things 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.160
 we have the face 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.170
 the soundtrack a couple of pirate pictures 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.440
 the friend figures the game in a box 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.440
 metallic 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.620
 postcards 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.560
 the art book you are seeing that the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.560
 Edition is completely notice 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.550
 It will erase a lot 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.479
 up here in an edition boxing 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.940
 special up to 64 blacks is like 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.669
 you can see there is everything on the table that does not 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.250
 it fits absolutely more nothing on top of 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.410
 she and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.410

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.030
