00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
me ah stockbyte Regan is very difficult

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.390 
me ah stockbyte Regan is very difficult
and<00:03:47.080> it's<00:03:47.230> never<00:03:47.350> actually<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.860> try<00:03:48.069> and<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and it's never actually to try and the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.280 
and it's never actually to try and the
controls<00:03:48.790> bit<00:03:49.000> retarded<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.780> can't<00:03:50.020> try

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
controls bit retarded this you can't try

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.110 
controls bit retarded this you can't try
and<00:03:50.410> control<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.950> go<00:03:51.340> round<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> trees<00:03:51.910> it's

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
and control I go round the trees it's

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.960 
and control I go round the trees it's
quite<00:03:52.330> difficult<00:03:52.540> oh<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.650> what<00:03:53.920> what<00:03:54.730> though

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
quite difficult oh but what what though

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.130 
quite difficult oh but what what though
oh<00:03:55.420> my<00:03:56.140> god<00:03:56.380> right<00:03:57.370> well<00:03:57.670> we'll<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.420> back<00:03:58.720> when

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
oh my god right well we'll be back when

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.130 
oh my god right well we'll be back when
that<00:03:59.170> continues<00:03:59.860> hang<00:04:00.100> on<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> second<00:04:01.140> right

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
that continues hang on a second right

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.680 
that continues hang on a second right
we're<00:04:02.290> back<00:04:02.440> again<00:04:03.060> doing<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.180> bit<00:04:04.420> again

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
we're back again doing this bit again

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.330 
we're back again doing this bit again
hopefully<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.140> can<00:04:05.290> avoid<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.830> trees<00:04:06.100> but

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
hopefully I can avoid the trees but

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.580 
hopefully I can avoid the trees but
these<00:04:06.459> controls<00:04:06.940> are<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.150> bit<00:04:07.360> retarded<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.380> I'm

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
these controls are a bit retarded so I'm

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.070 
these controls are a bit retarded so I'm
a<00:04:08.680> bit<00:04:08.709> difficult<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.910> go<00:04:10.060> though<00:04:10.239> trying<00:04:10.930> I'm

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
a bit difficult you go though trying I'm

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.620 
a bit difficult you go though trying I'm
trying<00:04:11.110> my<00:04:11.380> hardest<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.980> think<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:13.180> easier<00:04:13.569> to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
trying my hardest I think it's easier to

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.930 
trying my hardest I think it's easier to
follow<00:04:13.959> her<00:04:14.230> path<00:04:14.560> exactly<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.580> that's

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
follow her path exactly and that's

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.729 
follow her path exactly and that's
probably<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.450> safest<00:04:16.660> route<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.169> take<00:04:17.350> it's

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
probably the safest route to take it's

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.870 
probably the safest route to take it's
probably<00:04:17.829> why<00:04:18.010> she's<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.489> all<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.729> wrong

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
probably why she's on all the wrong

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.789 
probably why she's on all the wrong
actually<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.510> didn't<00:04:19.720> think<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:19.959> so

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
actually but I didn't think of that so

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.950 
actually but I didn't think of that so
it<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.430> follow<00:04:21.760> follow<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.419> route<00:04:22.570> she<00:04:22.780> seen

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
it just follow follow the route she seen

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.750 
it just follow follow the route she seen
from<00:04:23.080> taking<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.800> know<00:04:24.100> it's<00:04:24.310> quite<00:04:24.520> difficult

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
from taking I know it's quite difficult

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.490 
from taking I know it's quite difficult
when<00:04:25.090> she's<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.419> fired<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.990> in<00:04:26.110> his<00:04:26.200> Apple

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
when she's not fired of you in his Apple

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.090 
when she's not fired of you in his Apple
arms<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.490> know<00:04:27.639> must<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.510> done<00:04:28.690> oh<00:04:29.100> here

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
arms but you know must be done oh here

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.450 
arms but you know must be done oh here
we<00:04:30.130> go<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.840> not<00:04:32.080> completely<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.040> same<00:04:33.250> as

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
we go it's not completely the same as

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.480 
we go it's not completely the same as
the<00:04:33.550> film<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:35.410> ski<00:04:35.650> chasing<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.190> film<00:04:36.400> is

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the film I the ski chasing the film is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.190 
the film I the ski chasing the film is
fantastic<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.240> one<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.600> best<00:04:37.750> action

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
fantastic it's one of the best action

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.960 
fantastic it's one of the best action
sequences<00:04:39.100> in<00:04:39.400> any<00:04:39.789> james<00:04:40.090> bond<00:04:40.360> film<00:04:40.600> i<00:04:40.690> think

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
sequences in any james bond film i think
