okay<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.040> catalyst<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.910> creative

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
okay so here is the catalyst of creative

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.220 
okay so here is the catalyst of creative
inspiration<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.400> speed<00:00:17.640> square<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
inspiration for the speed square the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.330 
inspiration for the speed square the
smallest<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.449> maybe<00:00:21.449> most<00:00:22.439> out<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.980> being

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
smallest and maybe most out there being

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.689 
smallest and maybe most out there being
designed<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> long<00:00:24.150> time<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.430> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
designed in a long time and this is the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
designed in a long time and this is the
first<00:00:26.880> board<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.390> surfed<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
first board I surfed really you know I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
first board I surfed really you know I
think<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.490> people<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.090> like

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
think for a lot of people this was like

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.150 
think for a lot of people this was like
their<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:30.359> surfboard<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
their first surfboard and really the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
their first surfboard and really the
whole<00:00:32.399> objective<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.600> making<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> speed

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
whole objective of making the speed

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
whole objective of making the speed
square<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.300> fun<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
square it was just to have fun I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.520 
square it was just to have fun I
initially<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.879> nervous<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
initially was you know nervous about the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.369 
initially was you know nervous about the
project<00:00:41.360> essentially<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> change

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
project essentially we had to change

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
project essentially we had to change
some<00:00:44.250> elements<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> board<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.989> keep<00:00:46.200> most

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
some elements of the board but keep most

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
some elements of the board but keep most
of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> elements<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> outline<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.090> similar

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
of the elements the outline is similar

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.299 
of the elements the outline is similar
the<00:00:49.050> tail<00:00:50.059> detail<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.570> similar<00:00:52.280> with<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the tail detail is very similar with the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
the tail detail is very similar with the
bevel<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.660> basically<00:00:54.870> had<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> change<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
bevel and we basically had to change the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.970 
bevel and we basically had to change the
rails<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> concave<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.649> make<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
rails we put a concave in it to make it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.450 
rails we put a concave in it to make it
go<00:00:59.010> faster<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:00.809> fins<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.460> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
go faster and we put some fins on it so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310 
go faster and we put some fins on it so
it's<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.730> finless<00:01:03.149> anymore<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> they're

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it's not finless anymore and they're

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's not finless anymore and they're
fairly<00:01:04.680> short<00:01:05.100> keel<00:01:05.400> fins<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.090> you'd<00:01:06.330> find

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
fairly short keel fins like you'd find

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
fairly short keel fins like you'd find
on<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> fish<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.710> great<00:01:07.920> thing<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> fins

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
on a fish the great thing about the fins

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
on a fish the great thing about the fins
and<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> overall<00:01:09.240> rail<00:01:09.570> concept<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and the overall rail concept is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
and the overall rail concept is
basically<00:01:11.040> you're<00:01:12.020> riding<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> finless

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically you're riding like a finless

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
basically you're riding like a finless
board<00:01:13.770> where<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.100> completely<00:01:14.820> sink<00:01:15.270> rail

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
board where you can completely sink rail

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.440 
board where you can completely sink rail
and<00:01:15.810> turn<00:01:16.049> figure<00:01:16.710> eight<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.820> reminds<00:01:18.390> me

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and turn figure eight and it reminds me

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.170 
and turn figure eight and it reminds me
of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.080> mach<00:01:19.530> 7x<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> kid<00:01:20.939> like

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
of the mach 7x when I was a kid like

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
of the mach 7x when I was a kid like
this<00:01:21.210> surfing<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.840> day<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.140> being<00:01:22.799> pumped

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this surfing all day and being pumped

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.700 
this surfing all day and being pumped
and<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.380> fast

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and going really really really fast

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
and going really really really fast
behind<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> Alliance<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> second-fastest

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
behind the Alliance the second-fastest

00:01:27.869 --> 00:02:41.500 
behind the Alliance the second-fastest
board<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.229> live<00:01:28.380> show<00:01:28.680> speed<00:01:29.369> square

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.599 

the<00:02:42.510> next<00:02:42.750> board<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.469> the<00:02:43.739> Dharma<00:02:44.010> it's

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
the next board here is the Dharma it's

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.390 
the next board here is the Dharma it's
name<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.569> derived<00:02:45.870> off<00:02:46.469> the<00:02:46.709> original<00:02:46.769> being

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
name is derived off the original being

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.569 
name is derived off the original being
the<00:02:47.819> good<00:02:48.060> karma<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:50.250> tried<00:02:50.549> to

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the good karma and kind of just tried to

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.280 
the good karma and kind of just tried to
make<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.879> modern<00:02:52.370> little<00:02:53.370> piggy<00:02:53.879> fish<00:02:54.450> type

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
make a modern little piggy fish type

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.309 
make a modern little piggy fish type
board<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:56.250> still<00:02:56.730> has<00:02:56.970> progressive<00:02:57.750> nuances

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
board that still has progressive nuances

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.440 
board that still has progressive nuances
with<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:59.069> quad<00:02:59.459> set<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.819> so<00:02:59.939> you<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.060> speed

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
with a quad set up so you have speed

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.099 
with a quad set up so you have speed
nice<00:03:01.290> down<00:03:01.680> rails<00:03:02.129> with<00:03:02.819> kind<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.780> concave

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
nice down rails with kind of a concave

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.970 
nice down rails with kind of a concave
deck<00:03:04.439> line<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:06.569> basically<00:03:07.019> paddles<00:03:07.889> like

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
deck line and it basically paddles like

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.089 
deck line and it basically paddles like
a<00:03:08.099> longboard<00:03:08.720> search<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:10.019> short<00:03:10.470> board<00:03:10.769> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
a longboard search like short board and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.819 
a longboard search like short board and
goes<00:03:12.000> faster<00:03:12.569> than<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.079> can<00:03:13.200> ever<00:03:13.319> want<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> go

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
goes faster than you can ever want to go

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.509 
goes faster than you can ever want to go
on<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> wave<00:03:14.220> yeah<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.359> fish<00:03:16.069> but<00:03:17.069> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
on a wave yeah it's like a fish but the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.580 
on a wave yeah it's like a fish but the
good<00:03:17.669> thing<00:03:17.879> is<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.239> tail<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.780> flatter

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
good thing is the tail is flatter

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.069 
good thing is the tail is flatter
squared<00:03:20.400> off<00:03:20.579> more<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.989> a

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
squared off more so it is it's a

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.520 
squared off more so it is it's a
snappier<00:03:22.650> turn<00:03:23.120> more<00:03:24.120> responsive<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.109> it's<00:03:25.409> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
snappier turn more responsive so it's a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.869 
snappier turn more responsive so it's a
nice<00:03:26.010> blend<00:03:26.430> between<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.159> fish<00:03:29.159> I<00:03:29.370> guess<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.819> a

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
nice blend between a a fish I guess in a

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.170 
nice blend between a a fish I guess in a
in<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.329> modern<00:03:31.079> short<00:03:31.889> board<00:03:32.129> very<00:03:32.760> user

this<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:56.020> spork<00:03:56.380> it's<00:03:56.740> a<00:03:56.980> round<00:03:57.520> pin<00:03:58.110> quad

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
this is the spork it's a round pin quad

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.390 
this is the spork it's a round pin quad
and<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:02.080> overall<00:04:02.350> concept<00:04:02.920> with<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.190> word

and the overall concept with this word
was<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.850> make<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.470> high-performance<00:04:05.470> surfboard

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
was to make a high-performance surfboard

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.690 
was to make a high-performance surfboard
that<00:04:05.980> still<00:04:06.490> had<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.180> speed<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:08.050> glide<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:09.280> an

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that still had the speed and glide of an

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.760 
that still had the speed and glide of an
alternative<00:04:10.210> board<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:10.990> just<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.410> little<00:04:11.620> wider

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
alternative board so just a little wider

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.320 
alternative board so just a little wider
outline<00:04:12.270> similar<00:04:13.270> volume<00:04:13.480> nice<00:04:14.230> pinch<00:04:14.770> trails

makes me so stoked about this board I've

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.000 
makes me so stoked about this board I've
never<00:04:46.780> had<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.960> quad<00:04:47.230> where<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.650> push<00:04:47.920> the

never had a quad where I can push the
started<00:04:48.340> thruster<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.440> just<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:51.250> feedback

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
started thruster and just a feedback

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.480
