00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
the way we survive and that was the way

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.000 
the way we survive and that was the way
we<00:05:39.820> got<00:05:40.120> by<00:05:40.360> so<00:05:40.720> now<00:05:40.960> living<00:05:41.500> below<00:05:41.590> your<00:05:41.830> means

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
abundant living which is what I believe

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.270 
abundant living which is what I believe
in<00:05:46.540> my<00:05:46.660> faith<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.110> abundant<00:05:47.530> living<00:05:47.800> the

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
in my faith is abundant living the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310 
in my faith is abundant living the
opposite<00:05:48.640> of<00:05:48.729> that<00:05:48.790> to<00:05:49.180> me<00:05:49.360> is<00:05:49.630> it's<00:05:50.110> not<00:05:50.260> the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
opposite of that to me is it's not the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.840 
opposite of that to me is it's not the
way<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.830> got<00:05:50.979> intended<00:05:51.370> for<00:05:51.520> us<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.640> live

way that got intended for us to live

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.310 
way that got intended for us to live
that's<00:05:52.479> why<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:52.660> think<00:05:52.900> it's<00:05:53.020> absolutely

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
that's why I think it's absolutely
