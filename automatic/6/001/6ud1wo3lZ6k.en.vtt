that's amazing that you get that much

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
that's amazing that you get that much
depth<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> every<00:01:13.590> worker<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> place<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
depth and every worker you place in this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
depth and every worker you place in this
game<00:01:14.700> matters<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.710> top<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
game matters so much but then on top of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
game matters so much but then on top of
that<00:01:16.950> placing<00:01:17.340> workers<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.909> has

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that placing workers over here has

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
marketplace which is so interactive as I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
marketplace which is so interactive as I
am<00:01:38.100> making<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.700> art<00:01:39.119> pieces<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.960> more

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
am making my art pieces more and more

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.170 
am making my art pieces more and more
valuable<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.560> baking<00:01:41.159> making<00:01:41.520> yours<00:01:41.790> less

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
valuable I'm baking making yours less

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
valuable I'm baking making yours less
and<00:01:42.420> less<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.560> cross<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:43.860> third<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and less but if I cross over third and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
and less but if I cross over third and
threshold<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.970> start<00:01:45.360> becoming<00:01:45.659> valuable

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
threshold your start becoming valuable

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.600 
threshold your start becoming valuable
again<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.100> careful<00:01:47.369> about<00:01:47.430> how

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
again so I have to be careful about how

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.480 
again so I have to be careful about how

the<00:02:01.380> difference<00:02:01.740> between<00:02:01.890> you'll<00:02:02.520> building

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the difference between you'll building

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.639 
the difference between you'll building
buildings<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> cheap<00:02:03.840> crap<00:02:04.140> material

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
buildings with the cheap crap material

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
buildings with the cheap crap material
but<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.219> cheap<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.030> could<00:02:06.149> build

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
but is very cheap you could build

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
but is very cheap you could build
buildings<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:06.899> easily<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.740> them

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
buildings really easily just to get them

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.990 
buildings really easily just to get them
done<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.429> score<00:02:08.610> points<00:02:08.670> you're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
done so you can score points you're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
done so you can score points you're
having<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.270> built<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.810> opposed<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> taking

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
having them built as opposed to taking

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
having them built as opposed to taking
the<00:02:10.649> extra<00:02:10.979> time<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.459> use<00:02:11.670> the

not obviously there's a complex it's a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.949 
not obviously there's a complex it's a
really<00:02:47.550> robust<00:02:48.060> simulation<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> million

really robust simulation of a million
things<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.230> are<00:02:49.320> going<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:51.360> know

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
things that are going on but you know

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.680 
things that are going on but you know
everything<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.900> relatively<00:02:52.590> intuitive<00:02:52.890> it's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
everything is relatively intuitive it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.090 
everything is relatively intuitive it's
thematically<00:02:54.690> grounded<00:02:55.110> enough<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
thematically grounded enough for me to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.010 
thematically grounded enough for me to
me<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> understand<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.180> reason<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.570> auction

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
me I understand the reason this auction

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.750 
me I understand the reason this auction
exists<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.560> why<00:02:58.620> these<00:02:58.680> area<00:02:59.130> controls<00:02:59.430> exist

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
exists and why these area controls exist

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.710 
exists and why these area controls exist
and<00:02:59.940> why<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.310> unsavory<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.209> try<00:03:03.690> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and why it's unsavory to you know try to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
and why it's unsavory to you know try to
muscle<00:03:04.020> favours<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.800> people<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.280> that's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
muscle favours out of people and that's

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.560 
muscle favours out of people and that's
why<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> might<00:03:05.820> get<00:03:05.970> yourself<00:03:06.060> thrown<00:03:06.420> in

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
why you might get yourself thrown in

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.860 
why you might get yourself thrown in
jail<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.010> really<00:03:08.010> really<00:03:08.220> clever<00:03:08.870> absolutely
