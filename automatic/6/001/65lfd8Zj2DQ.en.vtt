which kind of looks like a super-sized
version<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.190> s3<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.120> fact<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> s3

here so let's have a look at them

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
here so let's have a look at them
side-by-side<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> takes<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
side-by-side as you can see it takes on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
side-by-side as you can see it takes on
the<00:00:59.399> appearance<00:00:59.489> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.449> galaxy<00:01:01.050> s3<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the appearance of the galaxy s3 so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.729 
the appearance of the galaxy s3 so
you've<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.550> those<00:01:02.699> rounded<00:01:03.300> edges<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.530> note

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you've got those rounded edges the note

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.690 
you've got those rounded edges the note
2<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> packing<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.820> rather<00:01:06.330> thin<00:01:06.840> bezel

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
2 is packing a rather thin bezel

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
2 is packing a rather thin bezel
stylings<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.750> similar<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
stylings are very very similar and the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
stylings are very very similar and the
notes<00:01:11.280> who<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.270> looks<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
notes who pretty much just looks like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.850 
notes who pretty much just looks like
it's<00:01:12.930> Big<00:01:13.140> Brother<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.110> let's<00:01:16.320> turn<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it's Big Brother so now let's turn it on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so while it boots itself art let's just

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
so while it boots itself art let's just
go<00:01:18.869> through<00:01:19.140> what's<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.950> protector<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
go through what's on the protector so

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
jelly bean which you'll see in a moment

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
jelly bean which you'll see in a moment
it's<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> quad<00:01:27.720> core<00:01:27.869> processor<00:01:27.930> Bluetooth

it's got a quad core processor Bluetooth
and<00:01:29.130> NFC<00:01:29.900> ok<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> biggest

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and NFC ok so one of the biggest

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
and NFC ok so one of the biggest
criticisms<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> original<00:01:33.030> note<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.390> that

criticisms of the original note was that
it<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> unwieldy<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> couldn't<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> used<00:01:34.829> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it was unwieldy and couldn't be used as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
it was unwieldy and couldn't be used as
a<00:01:35.159> phone<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.850> everyday<00:01:36.600> use<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
a phone for everyday use because it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.600 
a phone for everyday use because it's
5.3<00:01:38.159> inch<00:01:38.189> screen<00:01:38.549> well<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> note<00:01:39.270> 2<00:01:39.659> rocks<00:01:40.320> a

5.5 inch display so the same concerns
are<00:01:44.369> still<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> arise<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.630> fact<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.290> have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
are still going to arise in fact I have

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
are still going to arise in fact I have
the<00:01:46.710> original<00:01:46.799> note<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.049> can

the original note here and as you can
see<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.829> time<00:01:50.070> round<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.640> design<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
see this time round the design is a lot

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.410 
see this time round the design is a lot
nicer<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:52.439> lot<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.890> compact<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.970> bezel<00:01:54.329> will

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
nicer a lot more compact the bezel will

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
nicer a lot more compact the bezel will
lot<00:01:54.570> slimmer<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.409> generally<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.310> lot

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
lot slimmer and generally just a lot

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
lot slimmer and generally just a lot
slicker<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.110> terms<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> weight<00:01:58.649> both

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
slicker now in terms of weight both

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
slicker now in terms of weight both
devices<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.360> similar<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> fact<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
devices are pretty similar in fact I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
devices are pretty similar in fact I

1.6 gigahertz processor it's hard not to
be<00:03:30.720> impressed<00:03:31.100> by<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> notes<00:03:32.460> whose<00:03:32.760> fluidity

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
be impressed by the notes whose fluidity

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.740 
be impressed by the notes whose fluidity
and<00:03:33.510> speed<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.380> far<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.090> working<00:03:36.420> an<00:03:36.540> 8

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and speed so far so it's working an 8

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.560 
and speed so far so it's working an 8
megapixel<00:03:37.350> camera<00:03:37.380> around<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.130> back<00:03:40.700> as<00:03:41.700> you

megapixel camera around the back as you

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.170 
megapixel camera around the back as you
can<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:43.050> photo<00:03:43.500> quality<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:44.220> pretty<00:03:44.880> decent

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
can see photo quality is pretty decent

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180 
can see photo quality is pretty decent
but<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.600> course<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:45.990> is<00:03:46.170> something<00:03:46.350> we'll<00:03:47.100> be

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
but of course this is something we'll be

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.100 
but of course this is something we'll be
exploring<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.820> more<00:03:48.030> detail<00:03:48.450> in<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.870> full
