00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
at this point but what we do know is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.390 
at this point but what we do know is
that<00:00:28.790> he's<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.180> very<00:00:29.570> powerful<00:00:29.960> very<00:00:30.890> skilled

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400

I<00:00:39.070> think<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.400> somewhat<00:00:40.730> distressing<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
I think it's somewhat distressing to the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.540 
I think it's somewhat distressing to the
other<00:00:41.900> three<00:00:42.230> turtles<00:00:42.590> when<00:00:42.739> Leo<00:00:42.920> goes<00:00:43.190> off<00:00:43.370> on

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
other three turtles when Leo goes off on

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.369 
other three turtles when Leo goes off on
his<00:00:43.670> own<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.210> especially<00:00:44.629> when<00:00:44.960> he<00:00:45.050> goes<00:00:45.170> off

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
his own and especially when he goes off

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.639 
his own and especially when he goes off
to<00:00:45.590> talk<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:45.980> Saki<00:00:46.219> because<00:00:47.090> they<00:00:47.899> view<00:00:48.260> him

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
to talk to Saki because they view him

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.610 
to talk to Saki because they view him
and<00:00:49.059> rightly<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:50.300> as<00:00:50.600> sort<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:50.989> their<00:00:51.260> rudder

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and rightly so as sort of their rudder

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.220 
and rightly so as sort of their rudder
their<00:00:52.280> linchpin<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:53.989> kind<00:00:54.079> of

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
their linchpin and it is that kind of

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.990 
their linchpin and it is that kind of
weird<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.530> see<00:00:54.680> him<00:00:54.769> going<00:00:54.980> off<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:55.429> possibly

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
weird to see him going off and possibly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.930 
weird to see him going off and possibly
going<00:00:56.300> down<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.570> wrong<00:00:56.840> path<00:00:56.920> by<00:00:57.920> at<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.760> very

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
going down a wrong path by at the very

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.450 
going down a wrong path by at the very
least<00:00:59.059> meeting<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.870> Saki<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.559> possibly

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
least meeting with Saki and possibly

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520 
least meeting with Saki and possibly
joining<00:01:01.910> up<00:01:02.030> with<00:01:02.179> them<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:03.109> have<00:01:03.379> been

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
joining up with them we have been

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.020 
joining up with them we have been
fighting<00:01:03.980> each<00:01:04.129> other<00:01:04.280> when<00:01:04.850> we<00:01:05.000> should

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
fighting each other when we should

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.810 
fighting each other when we should
actually<00:01:05.540> be<00:01:06.050> on<00:01:06.230> the<00:01:06.260> same<00:01:06.680> side<00:01:07.070> fighting

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
actually be on the same side fighting

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.790 
actually be on the same side fighting
against<00:01:08.390> our<00:01:08.510> true<00:01:08.930> enemy

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
against our true enemy

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.010 
against our true enemy
we'll<00:01:10.370> probably<00:01:10.670> would<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.450> gone<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.990> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
we'll probably would not have gone to a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.690 
we'll probably would not have gone to a
meeting<00:01:12.380> with<00:01:12.530> Saki<00:01:12.980> if<00:01:13.310> he<00:01:13.460> had<00:01:13.550> not<00:01:13.640> been

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
meeting with Saki if he had not been

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.789 
meeting with Saki if he had not been
upset<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.510> he<00:01:14.780> would<00:01:15.140> certainly<00:01:15.350> have<00:01:15.650> taken

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
upset and he would certainly have taken

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.069 
upset and he would certainly have taken
his<00:01:16.040> brothers<00:01:16.340> with<00:01:16.579> him<00:01:16.670> part<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.689> reason

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079

for me first time flying first superhero
team-up<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.430> think<00:04:11.430> one<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.670> reasons<00:04:12.000> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
team-up I think one of the reasons that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.750 
team-up I think one of the reasons that
Michelangelo<00:04:12.689> has<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.530> attitude<00:04:14.280> or

Michelangelo has this attitude or

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.979 
Michelangelo has this attitude or
approach<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:16.650> four<00:04:17.099> Turtles

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
approach is that of all four Turtles

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.020 
approach is that of all four Turtles
he's<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.199> most<00:04:19.500> fascinated<00:04:20.400> by<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.609> human
