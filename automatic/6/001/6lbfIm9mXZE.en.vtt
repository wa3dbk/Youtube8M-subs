00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
then I'm gonna make one of these are the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.880 
then I'm gonna make one of these are the
fiberglass<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:36.960> real<00:00:37.230> nice<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> fancy

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and then I can hang it anywhere and do

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.060 
and then I can hang it anywhere and do
boat<00:00:41.190> repairs<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.940> know<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.480> sea<00:00:42.690> or

boat repairs you know when I'm at sea or
maybe<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> sit<00:00:44.910> outside<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
maybe I just want to sit outside the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.130 
maybe I just want to sit outside the
boat<00:00:45.570> when<00:00:45.960> we're<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:47.090> oh<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
boat when we're not in oh that was a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
boat when we're not in oh that was a
good<00:00:49.320> smoothie<00:00:50.030> anyway<00:00:51.030> maybe<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.140> there

good smoothie anyway maybe when there
we're<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.680> near<00:00:53.039> any<00:00:53.190> land<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> sit

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we're not near any land I want to sit

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.450 
we're not near any land I want to sit
outside<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.449> I'll<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
outside and I'll just put it there and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.630 
outside and I'll just put it there and
then<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.789> use<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> inside<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> swing<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
then I can use it inside as a swing I

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.170 
then I can use it inside as a swing I
guess<00:01:00.559> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.859> piece<00:01:02.160> set<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
guess I've got this piece set up and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.440 
guess I've got this piece set up and
ready<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.799> glued<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.129> fiberglass<00:01:05.460> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
ready to be glued in with fiberglass but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.410 
ready to be glued in with fiberglass but
the<00:01:06.570> Sun<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.850> blasting<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.240> on

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the Sun is right there blasting right on

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
the Sun is right there blasting right on
it<00:01:09.570> hey<00:01:10.580> Sun<00:01:11.580> makes<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.290> resin<00:01:13.290> hard<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it hey Sun makes the resin hard and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.210 
it hey Sun makes the resin hard and
really<00:01:13.799> fast<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:18.350> maybe<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> cloud<00:01:19.920> up

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
really fast so maybe there's a cloud up

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
really fast so maybe there's a cloud up
this<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.850> no<00:01:21.360> clouds<00:01:21.659> oh<00:01:21.930> there's<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
whatever I'll just make my next half

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.950 
whatever I'll just make my next half
ball<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> am<00:01:32.880> super<00:01:33.150> happy<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.780> those

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
ball and I am super happy with how those

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
ball and I am super happy with how those
eyeballs<00:01:34.380> came<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:36.500> do<00:01:37.500> still<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
eyeballs came out I do still want to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.950 
eyeballs came out I do still want to
change<00:01:39.229> these<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.590> screws<00:01:41.540> or<00:01:42.540> something

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
change these two screws or something

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560 
change these two screws or something
fatter<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.579> make<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> fiberglass<00:01:45.299> thing

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
fatter so I can make a fiberglass thing

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.440 
fatter so I can make a fiberglass thing
around<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.290> both<00:01:46.560> sides<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.280> it'll<00:01:47.460> last<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
around on both sides so it'll last a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.469 
around on both sides so it'll last a
long<00:01:48.630> time<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
long time but I can do that any time and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
long time but I can do that any time and
that's<00:01:51.600> easy<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.409> inside<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.100> boat<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that's easy to do from inside the boat I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:04.760 
that's easy to do from inside the boat I
don't<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.909> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.500 

is<00:02:05.770> going<00:02:06.010> surprisingly<00:02:06.280> smoothly<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> far

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
is going surprisingly smoothly so far

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.910 
is going surprisingly smoothly so far
well<00:02:10.510> except<00:02:10.930> for<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.140> fact<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.770> ran

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
well except for the fact that I just ran

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.370 
well except for the fact that I just ran
out<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.130> wax<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:13.360> makes<00:02:13.630> doing<00:02:13.840> molds<00:02:14.320> a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
out of wax which makes doing molds a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.640 
out of wax which makes doing molds a
little<00:02:14.590> tricky<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> want<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.900> risk<00:02:17.050> doing

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
little tricky do I want to risk doing

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.950 
little tricky do I want to risk doing
another<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.760> trusting<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:19.720> enough

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
another one and trusting there's enough

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.600 
another one and trusting there's enough
wax<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.650> able<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.830> get<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> thing<00:02:21.280> out

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
wax to be able to get the thing out

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.870 
wax to be able to get the thing out
yeah<00:02:22.210> better<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.720> wait<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:24.490> have<00:02:24.580> another

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
yeah better just wait I do have another
