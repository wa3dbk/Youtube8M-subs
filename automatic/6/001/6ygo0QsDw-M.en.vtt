00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 How about colleagues here we are in a new 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.690
 video in which we will talk about one of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.599
 the greatest news of the moment the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.940
 Russian meteorite there are things that do not close 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 and well we will give a brief review of it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
 to be able to inform us what 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 we will speak will be one the version of the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.150
 newscasts two things that do not close three 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.519
 possible good solutions we give step 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.230
 good subject 1 tell us what 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 means is that a meteorite of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 approximately 70 tons and 15 meters 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 in diameter fell in the city of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 chelyabinsk in the district of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.050
 Uruguayans the meteorite on impact 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 russian soil the expansive wave broke 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.250
 glasses of schools and buildings 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 surrounding areas, it should be noted that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.180
 close to the city not far away 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.739
 of the event there is a waste area 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 nuclear and silos with material 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 radioactive the next day the authorities 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 locals searched for the meteorite and the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 crater that such a meteorite would have 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 have left but only 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.359
 they found a small hole in a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.129
 near lake of 6 to 8 meters in diameter 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 the local population and some scientists 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 they only found 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.759
 fragments the city was devastated and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 the damage exceeds 30 million 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.509
 dollars there are injured with wounds of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.189
 medium magnitude small scratches in 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.929
 comparison with what could have 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.119
 past if they had not taken the 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.890
 necessary measures 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.829
 good hahaha just the reality of what 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 happened theme 2 the things that do not close are 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.890
 the following 1 the meteorite did not leave 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.810
 crater 2 according to the force media 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.049
 Russian air force had fired on the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.289
 meteorite 3 no trace of the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.299
 meteorite ok in 1 taking into account 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.429
 that the meteorite did not leave crater I have 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 several theories one is that the government 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.360
 Russian rock stole and took 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.099
 do scientific studies and the other 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.709
 is that they did not find the true zone 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:55.829
 of the impact without more that is what most 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.840
 I find coherence in the 2nd I weird that the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.030
 Air Force has shot down a meteor 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.789
 with a speed of 30 kilometers per 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 second or would it be even more 200 being 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.039
 exaggerated or something impossible with the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 technology today and over 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.090
 the 3 from already the Russian government will 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.620
 picked up the object and taken it to a place 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.360
 for research 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.950
 and for skeptics who think that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 it was a UFO or similar things 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.739
 I do not think it's feasible good closing this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.019
 issue and we go to the three possible 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.840
 solutions to the arid subject the credible and 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.610
 the incredible the credible and the most possible 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.500
 is that the Russian government has collected 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 quickly and discretely the object and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.180
 led to investigations or others 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.519
 objectives the incredible is that it has been 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 an extraterrestrial object a UFO ship or 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.329
 something that mysteriously has 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.790
 disappeared as in the cases that have 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.560
 happened in the US that the objects 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
 they crash leave only sheets of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 aluminum and another is that it has been some 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.400
 meteorite type dx material that at 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.370
 impact with the earth is pulverized by 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.030
 full leaving few traces and good 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.280
 colleagues 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.040
 this is all this is part of the special 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.109
 for 200 subs any doubt or something 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.540
 comment me what and good a big hug 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.760
 everyone and I hope you liked it and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.760
 without more see you in the next video
