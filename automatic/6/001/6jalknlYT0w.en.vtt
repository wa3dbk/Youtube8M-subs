00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.580 

and<00:00:33.150> let's<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> same<00:00:34.140> thing<00:00:34.410> I'll

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and let's do the same thing I'll

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.229 
and let's do the same thing I'll
position<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.220> cursor<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> middle<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
position the cursor in the middle of it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.819 
position the cursor in the middle of it
here<00:00:37.250> I'll<00:00:38.250> process<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:39.059> split<00:00:39.360> apart

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.319 

I'll<00:00:42.010> just<00:00:42.160> push<00:00:42.429> it<00:00:42.460> in<00:00:42.730> so<00:00:43.030> there's<00:00:43.210> an

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
I'll just push it in so there's an

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.180 
I'll just push it in so there's an
overlap<00:00:43.629> in<00:00:44.079> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.320> i<00:00:47.859> will<00:00:47.920> go<00:00:48.159> to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
overlap in here and i will go to

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.370 
overlap in here and i will go to
transitions<00:00:48.909> again

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.730 

and<00:00:52.670> we'll<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.090> same<00:00:54.360> 3d<00:00:55.260> shuffle

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
and we'll use that same 3d shuffle

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.810 
and we'll use that same 3d shuffle
transition<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.460> used<00:00:56.670> before<00:00:58.490> now<00:00:59.490> if<00:00:59.640> i<00:00:59.760> turn

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
transition I used before now if i turn

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
transition I used before now if i turn
the<00:01:00.180> camera<00:01:00.720> over<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> preview<00:01:01.590> screen

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the camera over to the preview screen

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
the camera over to the preview screen
now<00:01:02.160> maybe<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.790> better<00:01:02.970> sense<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.510> what

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
now maybe get a better sense of what

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.400 
now maybe get a better sense of what
this<00:01:05.420> transition<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.840> doing<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.290> its

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
this transition is really doing and its

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.480 
this transition is really doing and its
really<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.990> taking<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.170> picture<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
really kind of taking one picture the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
really kind of taking one picture the
first<00:01:11.790> scene<00:01:12.890> flipping<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.980> to<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.190> side<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
first scene flipping it to the side and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.180 
first scene flipping it to the side and
flipping<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> behind<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.560> second<00:01:16.980> picture

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
flipping it behind the second picture

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.180 
flipping it behind the second picture
which<00:01:17.550> is<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.960> course<00:01:19.200> still<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.620> same<00:01:19.830> scene

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
which is of course still the same scene

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.450

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
put the overlap in the in the transition

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.870 
put the overlap in the in the transition
in<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> scene<00:01:31.220> now<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the

that<00:03:17.049> improve<00:03:18.049> your<00:03:18.500> video<00:03:18.769> in<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> way<00:03:19.159> you

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
that improve your video in the way you

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.289 
that improve your video in the way you
hoping<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.390> prove<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.549> here's<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.640> sharpen<00:03:23.269> one

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
hoping to prove it here's a sharpen one

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.259 
hoping to prove it here's a sharpen one
that<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:23.629> used<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.140> your<00:03:24.609> movie<00:03:25.609> before<00:03:25.790> they

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
that I used on your movie before they

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:36.240 
that I used on your movie before they
said<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.659> liked

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.360 

for<00:03:36.880> your<00:03:37.060> movie<00:03:38.020> maybe<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.440> brightness<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
for your movie maybe this brightness and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.110 
for your movie maybe this brightness and
contrast<00:03:39.550> one<00:03:40.210> over<00:03:40.480> here<00:03:40.660> might<00:03:40.840> be<00:03:41.020> useful

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
contrast one over here might be useful

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.190 
contrast one over here might be useful
so<00:03:43.120> we're<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.510> do<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:43.870> double

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
so we're going to do is just double

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.070 
so we're going to do is just double
click<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.890> add<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.780> you'll<00:03:46.780> see<00:03:46.990> it

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
click that to add it you'll see it

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.780 
click that to add it you'll see it
appears<00:03:47.410> up<00:03:47.620> here<00:03:47.650> that's<00:03:48.070> been<00:03:48.220> added<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
appears up here that's been added to the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.170 
appears up here that's been added to the
chain<00:03:50.160> what<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.550> here<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.000> can

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
chain what you can do here is you can

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.790 
chain what you can do here is you can
actually<00:03:52.210> change<00:03:52.900> several<00:03:53.410> different

actually change several different

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.020 
actually change several different
effects<00:03:56.800> together<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:59.490> have<00:04:00.490> multiple

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
that says remove selected plug-in so you

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.350 
that says remove selected plug-in so you
can<00:07:10.980> take<00:07:11.130> out<00:07:11.310> one<00:07:11.610> if<00:07:11.760> you<00:07:11.850> don't<00:07:12.030> want<00:07:12.210> it

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.550 
can take out one if you don't want it
anymore<00:07:15.410> and<00:07:16.410> so<00:07:16.860> that's<00:07:18.110> that's<00:07:19.110> pretty<00:07:19.260> much

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
anymore and so that's that's pretty much

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.780 
anymore and so that's that's pretty much
how<00:07:19.740> that<00:07:19.950> works

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:24.790 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.070 

and<00:07:25.790> I<00:07:25.940> think<00:07:26.180> that's<00:07:26.360> where<00:07:26.480> I'm<00:07:26.600> gonna<00:07:26.750> end

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
and I think that's where I'm gonna end

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.160 
and I think that's where I'm gonna end
this<00:07:27.410> first<00:07:27.740> lesson
