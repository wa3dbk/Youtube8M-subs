 the blue bomb 82 also called manfredi all the horticultural daisy bombs 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.310
 by exploding a mixture of hydrogen oxygen and other elements 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.550
 in the air and not under the ground it produces a magnitude of about 3 ricter that 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.760

 the main difference between the two that true love a fb bomb have 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.839
 same effects as a nuclear bomb 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.530
 they can also cause the effect of a mushroom cloud but there is no pollution

 radiactive loop while the problem with a nuclear warhead that when it explodes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.880
 you not only have detonation but pollution spills remain

 we test a pure hypothesis we roof by rightly exist 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.450
 following a sort of precautionary principle when a hypothesis does not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 patently false and of such dramatic social importance 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 talking about it is better city waiting for 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.440
 also because many people and too many children got sick after there's a

 Impoverished effects I have been dropped on astra places this has 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.930

 they completely destroyed the country's infrastructure they destroyed

 how to perform the decay time of natural radioactivity online 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.370
 I want four, five billion years archweb the problem that fits 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.819
 now therefore as an attempt to kill the Iraqi population through

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:04.999
 silly 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.619
 in buildings of low high radioactivity research 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.150
 they don't want and nobody talk about subversion 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.430
 I accept the official risk spokesperson and we are not real we are 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.640
 we can not comment on research on the spread of cancer armani 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.289
 studies on risk factors 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.610
 do not give piasterelle funds any of this research 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.949
 extreme you can do oscar dike searches for terminology and clinical but not 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.289
 research on pensions or relative to this sector 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.360
 it is difficult to investigate radiation in Iraq 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.599
 but not only in Italy also in Italy we feel the experience of the then 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.880
 minister gianni mattioli for me the twins 2001 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.469
 extrem 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:01.719
 asks the Iraqi health minister Mubarak to meet me 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.400
 during the meeting 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.219
 f mubarak admire 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:12.719
 represents the elements for a really serious situation 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.509
 to see 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.919
 for sonnets 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.330
 because they had been bombed 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.009
 as it was depleted uranium bullets 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.419
 the request by the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.499
 Minister Mubarak and the one you were 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.740
 italy collaborate with 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.839
 an epidemiological research to highlight 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.090
 the dimension in the problem of identification by deletion and also 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.350
 possibility somehow to stir cassano aquatic I came to know that 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.740
 there was no precise 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:00.840
 therefore he cuts objection or a real ban on the part of the tin 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.210
 Atlantic administration of the pact between 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.960
 I don't know how to do research 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.690
 data on the effects of weapons used in mass with the years 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.690
 they begin to emerge dramatically 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.580
 this graph shows the increase in mortality due to tumors in Rome 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.699
 wisdom also increased significantly 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.570
 are in 2001 exceeded the number of 600 deaths a year due to cancer 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:37.789
 in 1989 the cancer deaths were only 34 you want inter school 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.120
 routes regarding netlog I collected the photos of the most cases 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.120
 strange with less risky malignant fibrous toma 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.550
 they are very rare tumors are closely associated with radiation they are caused 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.909
 from radiation 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.719
 so I documented with the photos in cancer
