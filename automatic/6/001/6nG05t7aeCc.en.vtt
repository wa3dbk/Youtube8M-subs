books I'm not a big grain person I think

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
books I'm not a big grain person I think
can<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.679> just<00:00:22.890> fine<00:00:23.099> without<00:00:23.339> grains<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
can do just fine without grains in the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
can do just fine without grains in the
diet<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.990> quinoa<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.410> actually<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.279> seed<00:00:27.439> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
diet but quinoa is actually a seed it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.769 
diet but quinoa is actually a seed it
cooks<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> grain<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:30.089> looks<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> grain

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
cooks like a grain it looks like a grain

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
cooks like a grain it looks like a grain
people<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.919> grain<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
people use it like a grain and it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.280 
people use it like a grain and it's
great<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.780> even<00:00:34.050> though<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
great but it's actually even though it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.540 
great but it's actually even though it's
a<00:00:34.350> great<00:00:34.500> substitute<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.040> grains<00:00:35.340> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a great substitute for grains it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.180 
a great substitute for grains it's
actually<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> seed<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.110> Incas<00:00:37.590> used<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.950> call

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
actually a seed the Incas used to call

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.370 
actually a seed the Incas used to call
this<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> mother<00:00:38.880> of<00:00:39.150> all<00:00:39.420> grains<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
this the mother of all grains and in the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.510 
this the mother of all grains and in the
Incan<00:00:40.710> armies<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.130> had<00:00:41.220> something<00:00:41.400> called

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
Incan armies they had something called

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.730 
Incan armies they had something called
war<00:00:41.970> balls<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.690> were<00:00:42.870> basically<00:00:43.080> quinoa

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
war balls which were basically quinoa

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.890 
war balls which were basically quinoa
and<00:00:44.190> fat<00:00:44.730> mixed<00:00:45.090> together<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.750> would

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
and fat mixed together and they would

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.750 
and fat mixed together and they would
feed<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.290> armies<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.830> stuff<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.220> keep<00:00:47.610> him

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
feed the armies this stuff and keep him

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
feed the armies this stuff and keep him
going<00:00:47.880> one<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.540> would<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> war<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.860> claim

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
going one that would go to war the claim

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.740 
going one that would go to war the claim
to<00:00:50.370> fame<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> quinoa<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.330> that<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.630> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to fame of quinoa is that it's the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.050 
to fame of quinoa is that it's the
highest<00:00:51.960> protein<00:00:52.380> of<00:00:52.740> any<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> grains<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
highest protein of any of the grains and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.520 
highest protein of any of the grains and
what<00:00:54.240> called<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.540> grain<00:00:54.780> even<00:00:55.020> though<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
what called the grain even though it's a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
what called the grain even though it's a
seed<00:00:55.740> we<00:00:55.950> know<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.220> to<00:00:56.310> see<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.880> cooks

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
seed we know what to see but it cooks

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.610 
seed we know what to see but it cooks
like<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> grain<00:00:57.480> looks<00:00:57.810> like<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.990> grain<00:00:58.230> smells

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like the grain looks like a grain smells

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.710 
like the grain looks like a grain smells
like<00:00:58.740> a<00:00:58.800> green<00:00:59.070> we'll<00:00:59.220> call<00:00:59.400> it<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.550> green<00:00:59.720> it's

like a green we'll call it a green it's
very<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.530> high<00:01:01.710> quality<00:01:01.770> protein<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.850> got

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
very very high quality protein it's got

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
very very high quality protein it's got
a<00:01:03.210> great<00:01:03.540> assortment<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> amino<00:01:04.500> acids<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a great assortment of amino acids and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
a great assortment of amino acids and
they're<00:01:05.129> very<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.580> balanced<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.270> similar

quinoa to make flour soup cereal most of
the<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.289> sold<00:01:13.649> as<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.859> whole<00:01:14.130> grain

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the time it's it's sold as a whole grain

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.919 
the time it's it's sold as a whole grain
to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.729> cooked<00:01:15.030> separately<00:01:15.359> you<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.719> about

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
to be cooked separately you use about

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:17.599 
to be cooked separately you use about
two<00:01:16.170> cups<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.499> water<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.859> one<00:01:17.039> cup<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.429> quinoa

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
two cups of water to one cup of quinoa

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.999 
two cups of water to one cup of quinoa
you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.420> substitute<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.140> rice<00:01:19.319> much

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you can substitute it for rice much

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.620 
you can substitute it for rice much
better<00:01:20.249> than<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.939> better<00:01:21.210> than<00:01:21.359> wheat

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
better than that it's better than wheat

better than that it's better than wheat
barley<00:01:22.079> for<00:01:22.499> things<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.799> calcium<00:01:23.460> magnesium

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and phosphorus and potassium

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.739 
and phosphorus and potassium
it's<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.069> minerals<00:01:26.609> galore<00:01:26.999> and<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.420> very

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
it's got minerals galore and it's very

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.200 
it's got minerals galore and it's very
high<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.289> iron<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:29.039> on<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.429> that<00:01:29.670> five

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
high in iron and on top of that five

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.059 
high in iron and on top of that five
grams<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.689> fiber<00:01:30.869> per<00:01:30.990> cup<00:01:31.289> very<00:01:31.619> very<00:01:31.859> good

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
grams of fiber per cup very very good

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.340 
grams of fiber per cup very very good
less<00:01:32.880> allergenic<00:01:33.210> than<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.899> lot<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> other

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
grains so if you want grains and you

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.059 
grains so if you want grains and you
can't<00:01:36.840> manage<00:01:37.079> wheat<00:01:37.469> or<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.920> other
