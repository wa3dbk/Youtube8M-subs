00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.730 
concerned how you know not long device
to<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.790> child<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.500> comes

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
to the child so you have it comes

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.140 
to the child so you have it comes
actually<00:03:29.890> with<00:03:30.160> two<00:03:30.340> different<00:03:30.520> devices<00:03:30.880> you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
actually with two different devices you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.780 
actually with two different devices you
can<00:03:31.180> either<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.660> bracelet<00:03:32.470> or<00:03:32.680> around<00:03:33.670> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
can either do a bracelet or around the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.310 
can either do a bracelet or around the
forehead<00:03:34.030> similar<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> pair<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.170> goggles

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
forehead similar to a pair of goggles

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.910 
forehead similar to a pair of goggles
and<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.820> can<00:03:37.150> choose<00:03:37.360> which<00:03:37.570> one<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.740> want

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
and so you can choose which one you want

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.470 
and so you can choose which one you want
to<00:03:38.950> put<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.220> there<00:03:39.430> whether<00:03:39.610> your<00:03:39.850> child<00:03:39.880> wants

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
to put on there whether your child wants

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.030 
to put on there whether your child wants
it<00:03:40.690> on<00:03:40.780> their<00:03:40.930> wrist<00:03:41.140> rather<00:03:41.380> than<00:03:41.560> fidgeting

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
it on their wrist rather than fidgeting

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.440 
it on their wrist rather than fidgeting
around<00:03:42.100> with<00:03:42.400> their<00:03:42.520> forehead<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.180> what<00:03:43.390> if

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
around with their forehead so what if

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.150 
around with their forehead so what if
they<00:03:43.510> were<00:03:43.690> having<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.320> their<00:03:44.710> hand<00:03:44.950> like

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
they were having it on their hand like

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.440 
they were having it on their hand like
they're<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.580> water<00:03:45.760> anyway<00:03:46.180> playing

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
they're in the water anyway playing

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.580 
they're in the water anyway playing
around<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.870> thing<00:03:47.080> would<00:03:47.200> be<00:03:47.290> going<00:03:47.470> off

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
around so that thing would be going off

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.410 
around so that thing would be going off
every<00:03:47.830> three<00:03:48.190> seconds<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> app<00:03:49.180> you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
every three seconds so in the app you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.180 
every three seconds so in the app you
can<00:03:49.540> set<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> timer<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.230> if<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.680> have<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> child

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
can set a timer so if you have a child

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.900 
can set a timer so if you have a child
who<00:03:51.520> say<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.800> decent<00:03:53.800> swimmer<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.580> set<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
who say is a decent swimmer you set the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.150 
who say is a decent swimmer you set the
timer<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.690> after<00:03:56.260> 20<00:03:56.620> seconds<00:03:57.010> if

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
timer so that after 20 seconds if

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.800 
timer so that after 20 seconds if
they're<00:03:57.340> still<00:03:57.550> underwater<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.300> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
they're still underwater and that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.120 
they're still underwater and that
connection<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.500> there<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.770> Bluetooth

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
connection is in there for Bluetooth

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.740 
connection is in there for Bluetooth
it's<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.970> alarm<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.540> let<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.660> know

that there's child that could possibly

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.190 
that there's child that could possibly
be<00:04:03.790> drowning<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.240> your<00:04:04.360> pool<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.870> should<00:04:05.050> put

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
be drowning in your pool you should put

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.990 
be drowning in your pool you should put
them<00:04:05.290> in<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.530> goggle<00:04:05.890> into<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.460> goggles<00:04:06.850> or

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
them in the goggle into the goggles or

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.490 
them in the goggle into the goggles or
in<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.600> nose<00:04:07.750> guard<00:04:07.990> because<00:04:08.080> those<00:04:08.290> are<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
in the nose guard because those are the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.200 
in the nose guard because those are the
two<00:04:08.650> things<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.950> people<00:04:09.670> use<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.030> yeah<00:04:10.180> that

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
two things that people use it yeah that

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.910 
two things that people use it yeah that
could<00:04:10.510> be<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.780> next<00:04:11.020> step<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.560> product

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
could be the next step for the product

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.580 
could be the next step for the product
moving<00:04:12.610> forward<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.270> we'll<00:04:14.110> see<00:04:14.260> how<00:04:14.290> much

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
moving forward so we'll see how much

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.380 
moving forward so we'll see how much
that<00:04:14.800> monocle<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:15.640> called<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> ice<00:04:16.060> wind
