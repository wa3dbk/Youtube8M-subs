00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.350
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.810
 make a short video for you 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.039
 introduce my new 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.919
 so that's so 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.759
 first there is a polo like that to 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:26.029
 short sleeve that cost 4 hours 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.309
 0.95 cdu d'auzan so his marks and iam 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.599
 exciting on the sides it's like 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:38.210
 that's it I'm not lying very well I'm 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:44.329
 sorry focus here short-sleeved and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.820
 here is the magic I have that I have 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.939
 already out their box since I 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.790
 have already used so I used that 

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.290
 the orange that you can see in my 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.330
 video how to make a passage I 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.780
 the used that it really works very 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.930
 well 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.290
 so the original box is that which has 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.909
 cost 14 euros 95 and behind that is 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.189
 like that then facts that's what I 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 do not know at all the price so 35 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.560
 38 like that brand fugan souls that has 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.740
 two pairs here is a soft gray brush 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 like that gray recuperator of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:31.760
 dust then that's the 700 gb of 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.000
 montcuq I'm really happy 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.630
 because it was not long enough 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.659
 that I wanted it so the spark and 1700 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.070
 it can be mounted on it supports 81 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.110
 kg and there we can mark his name 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.930
 so opening is how we can 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.150
 put a padlock here it's a 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.510
 surface made purposefully to put the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.170
 whips the retractable handle of 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.720
 grease and there is marked nasa stride and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.630
 on the seebach coasts and as 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.010
 little handles in fact below that's it 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.950
 like little holes to put the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.739
 hands on both sides and behind who has 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.739
 really nothing special is very simple 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.739
 here 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:33.230
 so when at the louvre she is like that 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.370
 so that's the way it is so 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.050
 three compartments a way on the side 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.000
 like a little gray-stitched like that so the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.980
 small normally as you buy it 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 the box the whey on this side but 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 I loved him on this side and a great 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:03:01.580
 compartment 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:07.130
 so here is then there is a carpet so 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.840
 a carpet like that so here it is so 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.420
 it's like that there are twisted spikes 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.910
 he is black I think really great 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.690
 pretty it's pretty light and inside 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.430
 it's like that in honeycomb and 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:26.420
 the other side he's like this I'm the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.790
 find really super nice so there 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.790
 had a promotion and suddenly he has 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.500
 cost 14 euros 95 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.739
 so that's after that there is another 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.870
 paper so the nicoles are not 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.390
 still arrived but I would surely 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 So here it is not exactly 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.290
 the right color you see 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.709
 normally it's the raspberry carpet 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.620
 so it cost 27 euros 95 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.820
 it is like that on the borders 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.859
 the patients they are like that 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.590
 do not quite see the right color 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.880
 but he is he is a little raspberry so 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.790
 that's it 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:16.280
 he's like that and on the other side 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:23.310
 it's really simple like that 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:28.699
 Here and inside it is like 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:34.199
 that's honeycomb so that's it 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:35.370
 so this video is over I hope 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.919
 that you will have liked 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.400
 so basically there were two carpets even g 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.250

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.360
