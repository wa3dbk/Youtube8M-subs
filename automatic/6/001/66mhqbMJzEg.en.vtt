00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.689
 all the fun in my life 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.820
 suddenly appears 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.089
 television is no exception 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.739
 I studied in the fourth year of history 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:22.550
 Faculty of Kharkov 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.999
 my state university 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.239
 loved one 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.019
 previously named Vasily Lazarovich Karazin 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.970
 and did not see the branch running 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.769
 line on one of the first then not 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.610
 state TV channels Kharkov 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.600
 where were the young invited to try? 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 ambitious xx 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.930
 confident in strength 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.790
 talented people 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.470
 in journalism 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.380
 Of course I understood that this is an example. 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.410
 and 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 no less decided to settle down 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.870
 In general, this process water and I 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.900
 tried myself wherever only 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.150
 can i go to all sorts of courses 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.570
 all sorts of contests and now not 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.710
 was one such adventure 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.890
 stages 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 and 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.830
 only 10 years later can I say this 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.590
 the adventure spilled out 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.200
 professionally 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.630
 calling really here since i 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.980
 became 100 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.220
 and the first month just wore a microphone 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.620
 experienced magazine 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.070
 my task was to shoot 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 I must tell the microphone to get the stand 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.850
 year neat bukarts put 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.840
 in front of the speaker 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.230
 and of course not everyone knows 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.530
 it was my first journalistic work 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.729
 but in parallel, I watched how they work 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.510
 experienced venerable knees 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.230
 studied 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.100
 in the end I was even entrusted 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.680
 death reportage from this began my 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 career 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.930
 no secret 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.250
 about 38 summer today not 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.469
 will say 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.229
 at inter channel 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.329
 the same noteworthy tea 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.329
 supply consciousness 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.599
 very often prepare the opinion of a sociologist 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.859
 the future must be first 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.809
 pics and cynical that 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.189
 should be the owner 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.369
 regular features 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.659
 generally a lot 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.049
 make claims 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.149
 terrain 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.579
 i stick 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.079
 slightly different looks I think that 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.189
 basic 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.939
 properties lead this first of all his godfather 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.839
 and if not 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.219
 of this quality 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.889
 then everyone else is superficially and peculiar 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:15.929
 tertiary 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.649
 Well, there are plenty of examples 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.599
 far from the most correct features 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.369
 faces but insanely charismatic 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.129
 leading 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.480
 even with the wrong diction but if you 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.539
 have something to say 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.579
 who doesn't care what you look like though 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.759
 Of course it is worth supporting some 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.169
 professional form 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 most importantly et al your inner state 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.189
 ohhh and understanding what you say 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.339
 so the biggest man 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.929
 bringing to the viewer then why is he no idea 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.599
 has neither understands empathizes not 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.790
 sympathetic he will not cause trust and 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.149
 respect the viewer 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.329
 and trust is respect for our main 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.689
 and our main reputational moment
