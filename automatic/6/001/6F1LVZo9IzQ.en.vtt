00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.930
 Yes that's about that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.600
 wiki of 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:15.480
 I explained how to use it. This is a general warm season and stock price 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.190
 It is a company that is Nagasato or deep 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.289
 Fall to understand 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.420
 Well I think that this is thin marginal cost 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:28.550
 As I said before, this is big big 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.600
 Is slack and Toka good to you is deep only over Omori'll at tiny love in such Fu 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.320
 Get out 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.320
 I explained that I will run out, but why? 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.180
 When it runs out 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:48.400
 Hey you briefly explain the fish that do become that flower Hatsu 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:52.480
 I do n't know what this is, but I think this is there 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.510
 Let's go there like this 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.640
 I put it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.610
 When the fish came to eat 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.970
 You can breathe 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.180
 However 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.240
 that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 It is also the same as the greeting side that people get cut 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 Ummm 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.200
 After dumplings, I'm going to wait, but if I'm waiting, I'm going to go through something like gluten comes a little 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 As a result if it is summer udon, it is always in this form 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.159
 But why etc. Why I please better not look Karaka Nagakere 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.159
 But I inhale a certain become even Sonaruto this 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 Boiling to do Is the I I'll move Kedomo I wind 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 Flower Deco husband will be good 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.790
 Do you know I 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.760
 this 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.120
 Because it will be the movement of the float 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.420
 It was in the state which did not enter the switch 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.340
 Picked up for the first time by agreeing with 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.030
 Can be empty 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:00.159
 So say a list Harris was Western in a case that is attached to the large solid varnish leisure floor is probably 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.170
 It's about the rainy season even if you hit it, so it's almost like a leaf like this 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.710
 so 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.970
 I want to do it 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.520
 What 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.800
 As I said earlier, I can use this kind of mind 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.750
 that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:18.990
 It 's about entering the equipment from here , even if it's a little 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.560
 Could it top powerless because there is no buoyancy in the rainy season 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.610
 As it is in a state of being put on the offensive by all means bottom 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.490
 Anxiety Fa just swimming that fish 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.210
 I can sense it and wait 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.840
 I get a beautiful hit 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.440
 It 's a bit of a school that you'll get rid of at night 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.180
 It becomes easy to cut 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.160
 For that 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.240
 Not the type delivery date 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.350
 Innocent trees that always compensate will be advantageous 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.350
 This is 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.780
 It is a social sound of being able to catch fish or not 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.410
 It is that you have now of the chop 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.410
 It means that
