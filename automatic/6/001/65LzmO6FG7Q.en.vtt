of the thing I've read everything I've
seen<00:00:44.820> after<00:00:45.090> years<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.289> lobbying<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:47.550> this

seen so far seems to suggest that the
best<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.579> deal<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> problem<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
best way to deal with the problem is to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.400 
best way to deal with the problem is to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.300 
what we really need is some common sense
it<00:01:59.579> can't<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.210> hard<00:02:00.509> oh<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.100> how

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it can't be that hard oh you can see how

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.600 
it can't be that hard oh you can see how
I<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.579> frustrated<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.450> such<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> big<00:02:04.020> fight

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
I get frustrated it's such a big fight

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.249 
I get frustrated it's such a big fight
we<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> resources<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.780> people

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
we have all the resources we have people

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.900 
we have all the resources we have people
who<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.409> willing<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> sort<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.700> let

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
who are willing to sort it out just let

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
who are willing to sort it out just let
them<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.239> access<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.899> their<00:02:10.020> public<00:02:10.410> lands

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
them have access to their public lands

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.270 
them have access to their public lands
and<00:02:11.250> work<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> system

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
and work out a system

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
and work out a system
so<00:02:12.819> they<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.090> handle<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.510> safely<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.380> as

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so they can handle it safely and as

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.680 
so they can handle it safely and as
humanely<00:02:15.100> as<00:02:15.220> possible<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.880> don't<00:02:16.120> tell<00:02:16.510> me

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
humanely as possible and don't tell me

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.780 
humanely as possible and don't tell me
about<00:02:16.840> these<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.440> I've<00:02:17.560> seen<00:02:17.980> baiting<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.730> know

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
about these as I've seen baiting I know

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.270 
about these as I've seen baiting I know
what<00:02:19.090> baiting<00:02:19.510> does<00:02:19.690> forget<00:02:20.020> 1080<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.860> right

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
what baiting does forget 1080 all right

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
what baiting does forget 1080 all right
indiscriminate<00:02:22.240> killer<00:02:22.720> anyway<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.650> it's

indiscriminate killer anyway and it's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.550 
indiscriminate killer anyway and it's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
highly on my own thinking this it's just

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.170

such a common-sense solution we are

such a common-sense solution we are
