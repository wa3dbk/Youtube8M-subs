00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
row this first time ever doing this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
row this first time ever doing this
movement<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.689> took<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> while<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> set<00:01:25.500> up

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
movement so it took a while to set up

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
movement so it took a while to set up
the<00:01:25.830> bench<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:27.650> where<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.010> felt<00:01:29.369> good<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.360> we

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the bench to where it felt good and we

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.320 
the bench to where it felt good and we
were<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.500> lost<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.640> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> weight<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
were just lost on what kind of weight to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.950 
were just lost on what kind of weight to
use<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.110> kept<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.439> light<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:36.240> both<00:01:36.540> use

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
use so we just kept it light we both use

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.820 
use so we just kept it light we both use
the<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.830> believe<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> 35<00:01:39.060> pound<00:01:39.360> dumbbells

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830

the I believe that 35 pound dumbbells
and<00:01:42.799> felt<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.040> good<00:01:44.360> after<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.110> set

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and felt really good after the first set

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.740 
and felt really good after the first set
just<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> trial<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.610> error<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
just kind of trial and error how to to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.859 
just kind of trial and error how to to
pull<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.990> focus<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> lats<00:01:53.869> to

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
I'm gonna increase the weight

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.770 
I'm gonna increase the weight
because<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.249> did<00:02:18.400> feel<00:02:18.579> light<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.599> was<00:02:22.689> able

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
because it did feel light and I was able

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.979 
because it did feel light and I was able
to<00:02:22.959> pull<00:02:23.620> my<00:02:23.739> elbows<00:02:24.010> pretty<00:02:24.879> far<00:02:25.090> back<00:02:25.359> and<00:02:25.689> I

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
to pull my elbows pretty far back and I

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.330 
to pull my elbows pretty far back and I
noticed<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.349> he<00:02:26.560> wasn't<00:02:26.739> bringing<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.189> as

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
noticed that he wasn't bringing it as

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.379 
noticed that he wasn't bringing it as
far<00:02:28.269> back<00:02:29.249> which<00:02:30.249> I<00:02:30.549> think<00:02:30.879> it's<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.269> not

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389
