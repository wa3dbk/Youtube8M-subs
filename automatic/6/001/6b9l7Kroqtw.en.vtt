spent<00:00:49.170> several<00:00:49.530> times<00:00:49.770> recording<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.579> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
spent several times recording and then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
spent several times recording and then
re-recording<00:00:51.449> trying<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> mod

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
activating stuff so just in my opinion

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
activating stuff so just in my opinion
avoid<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.480> book<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> unless<00:00:58.079> you

to go left hit the left arrow key to go

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.130 
to go left hit the left arrow key to go
up<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.729> hold<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.299> shift

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
up you hold right shift

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.330 
up you hold right shift
to<00:01:47.680> go<00:01:47.830> down<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.340> hold<00:01:48.580> right<00:01:49.030> control<00:01:50.340> and

to go down you hold right control and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.070 
to go down you hold right control and
there's<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.550> little<00:01:51.729> bit<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.030> momentum<00:01:52.420> change

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
there's a little bit of momentum change

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.980 
there's a little bit of momentum change
here<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:53.680> that's<00:01:54.070> pretty<00:01:54.220> nice<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.840> not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
hit the zero key on the number pad I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.859 
hit the zero key on the number pad I
should<00:02:09.670> stop<00:02:09.850> everything<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.390> if<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.720> want

well<00:06:12.620> that's<00:06:12.800> just<00:06:12.889> an<00:06:13.009> example<00:06:13.099> of<00:06:13.400> some

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
well that's just an example of some

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.100 
aerial combat you can do with this mod
that<00:06:15.710> would<00:06:15.800> be<00:06:15.919> pretty<00:06:16.219> fun<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:17.210> do<00:06:17.330> if<00:06:17.509> the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
that would be pretty fun to do if the

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.800 
that would be pretty fun to do if the
dragon<00:06:18.499> could<00:06:18.680> land<00:06:18.979> maybe<00:06:19.699> on<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.210> sides<00:06:20.689> of

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
dragon could land maybe on the sides of

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.950 
dragon could land maybe on the sides of
the<00:06:20.930> ship<00:06:21.169> or<00:06:22.210> I'm<00:06:23.210> not<00:06:23.360> really<00:06:23.599> sure<00:06:23.749> how<00:06:23.840> they

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
the ship or I'm not really sure how they

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.140 
the ship or I'm not really sure how they
would<00:06:24.050> script<00:06:24.349> that<00:06:24.499> in<00:06:24.710> but<00:06:25.249> loaded<00:06:25.939> pretty

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
would script that in but loaded pretty

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.529 
would script that in but loaded pretty

the<00:06:33.199> video<00:06:33.409> description<00:06:33.469> below<00:06:33.919> of<00:06:34.159> course

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
the video description below of course

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.980 
the video description below of course
and<00:06:36.639> yeah<00:06:37.639> definitely<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.270> Skyrim<00:06:38.599> on<00:06:38.689> minute

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
and yeah definitely the Skyrim on minute

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.719 
and yeah definitely the Skyrim on minute
is<00:06:39.110> probably<00:06:39.650> like<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:39.830> scar<00:06:40.099> in<00:06:40.189> five<00:06:40.370> minutes

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
is probably like a scar in five minutes

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.209 
is probably like a scar in five minutes
and<00:06:41.080> all<00:06:42.080> this<00:06:42.229> was<00:06:42.409> done<00:06:42.439> live<00:06:42.800> so<00:06:43.099> I'm

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
and all this was done live so I'm

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.589 
and all this was done live so I'm
thinking<00:06:43.490> about<00:06:43.520> doing<00:06:43.669> that<00:06:43.969> technique<00:06:44.389> to

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
thinking about doing that technique to

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.269 
thinking about doing that technique to
doing<00:06:44.960> a<00:06:45.080> more<00:06:45.560> of<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.680> live<00:06:45.889> commentary

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279 
doing a more of a live commentary

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.820 
doing a more of a live commentary
because<00:06:46.550> if<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.330> do<00:06:47.469> pre-recorded<00:06:48.469> stuff<00:06:48.680> with

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
because if I do pre-recorded stuff with

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.709 
because if I do pre-recorded stuff with
some<00:06:49.009> cinematic<00:06:49.520> shots<00:06:49.909> and<00:06:50.120> stuff<00:06:50.330> just<00:06:50.539> for

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
some cinematic shots and stuff just for

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.829 
some cinematic shots and stuff just for
like<00:06:50.900> one<00:06:51.080> or<00:06:51.110> two<00:06:51.199> mods<00:06:51.500> a<00:06:52.300> week<00:06:53.300> is<00:06:53.539> fine

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:53.839 
like one or two mods a week is fine

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.600 
like one or two mods a week is fine
because<00:06:54.409> it<00:06:54.680> takes<00:06:54.830> about<00:06:54.949> one<00:06:55.189> or<00:06:55.279> two<00:06:55.310> hours

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
because it takes about one or two hours

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.600 
because it takes about one or two hours
for<00:06:55.759> that<00:06:55.849> or<00:06:56.000> more<00:06:56.270> per<00:06:56.870> mod<00:06:57.080> but<00:06:58.039> to<00:06:58.460> do<00:06:58.580> it

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
for that or more per mod but to do it

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.059 
for that or more per mod but to do it
for<00:06:58.849> every<00:06:59.330> day<00:06:59.779> these<00:07:00.139> stuff<00:07:00.469> would<00:07:00.740> be<00:07:00.770> kind

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
for every day these stuff would be kind

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:05.980 
for every day these stuff would be kind
of<00:07:03.969> redundant<00:07:04.969> oh<00:07:05.060> not<00:07:05.300> really<00:07:05.419> redundant<00:07:05.870> but

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
of redundant oh not really redundant but

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.480 
of redundant oh not really redundant but
it<00:07:06.080> wouldn't<00:07:06.229> no<00:07:06.319> just<00:07:06.529> burn<00:07:06.680> myself<00:07:06.949> out<00:07:07.250> real

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
it wouldn't no just burn myself out real

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.459 
it wouldn't no just burn myself out real
quick<00:07:07.669> so<00:07:07.939> but<00:07:08.839> yeah<00:07:08.960> anyways<00:07:09.259> I<00:07:09.379> would

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
quick so but yeah anyways I would
