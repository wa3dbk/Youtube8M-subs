00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
of wire that's about that big and I'm

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.000 
of wire that's about that big and I'm
using<00:00:44.290> wire<00:00:44.559> that's<00:00:45.010> like<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.940> steady<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
using wire that's like that steady so it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.470 
using wire that's like that steady so it
would<00:00:48.430> be<00:00:48.790> better<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.390> use<00:00:49.750> all<00:00:50.199> I<00:00:50.500> have<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.830> do

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
how get the three popsicle sticks

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.969 
how get the three popsicle sticks
line<00:01:18.850> them<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.180> make<00:01:19.869> sure<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.259> middle<00:01:20.470> ones<00:01:20.830> a

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
line them up make sure the middle ones a

little taller than all the other ones

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.020 
little taller than all the other ones
because<00:01:23.860> that's<00:01:24.190> going<00:01:24.399> to<00:01:24.490> be<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.789> blade

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
because that's going to be the blade

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.910 
because that's going to be the blade
that<00:01:25.300> your<00:01:25.450> dynamic<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.350> then<00:01:27.420> put<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.920> put

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
that your dynamic and then put this put

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.999 
that your dynamic and then put this put
it<00:01:30.100> through<00:01:31.000> right<00:01:31.509> there<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.560> just

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
it through right there and just just

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.940 
it through right there and just just
hammer<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.550> through<00:01:33.849> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:35.380> when<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.740> made

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
hammer it through and then when you made

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.949 
hammer it through and then when you made
the<00:01:36.099> blade<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.789> part<00:01:40.390> will<00:01:40.479> open

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
the blade and then this part will open

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.199 
the blade and then this part will open
up<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.200> little<00:01:41.410> bit<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.360> use<00:01:44.200> superglue

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
up a little bit so I use superglue

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.309 
up a little bit so I use superglue
that's<00:01:46.209> another<00:01:46.539> thing<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:46.959> you'll<00:01:47.140> eat

stick or wooden anything that will fit
right<00:02:08.380> there<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.149> superglue<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.599> where<00:02:10.720> it

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
right there and superglue it to where it

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.080 
right there and superglue it to where it
will<00:02:10.989> be<00:02:11.080> right<00:02:11.290> there<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.739> make<00:02:12.580> sure<00:02:12.880> that
