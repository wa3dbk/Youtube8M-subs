00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.250
 in the first section we worked what was the cells a cell of their 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.759
 fundamental parts 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 we talk about the functions we talk about the organ players the physical part or 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.009
 chemistry in which we find ourselves 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.969
 today we find the second section with the protagonist 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.609
 main are called tissues 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.259
 who with the layoffs 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.780
 who make it up 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.290
 honestly conceptual facto we are going to locate ourselves in this context 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.940
 first the tissues 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 are part of the expected multicellular 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.740
 Multicellular beings are those that are characterized 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.640
 by a level of realization 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.340
 called fabrics 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.640
 the basic concepts that relate to the wounded 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.910
 they are the branch 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.360
 yamada history the one that studies the tissues 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.350
 because they are between the 0 60 dollars the criminals of the network 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.070
 they are perfectly the few painters to the prisoners 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.640
 cell phones is not arrogant consists in an activity so 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.950
 Independent 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.230
 When we talk about fabrics we have to know what is the concept of 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.970
 tissues that this gibbs 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480
 is the concern of cells 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.280
 like functions equal shapes 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.140
 The product of a coexistence is the cell phone 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.730
 Cell differentiation is carried out thanks to the process called mitosis 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.640
 mitosis allows me the growth and specialization of these cells 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.610
 then we will find different types of tissues 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.300
 the cells must live 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.570
 they must exchange nutrients 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.880
 and that substance called intercellular substances 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 are the ones that will allow 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.540
 in this grouping 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.450
 live 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.209
 forgive the redundancy through which these harmful substances 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.440
 we find two large types of tissues 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.470
 plant tissues and asthma tissues 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.990
 let's see what those plant tissues are 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.289
 animax 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:19.529
 the senses differ from the cells they differ from the organs and different 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.289
 systems but little 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.620
 the fact that he did does not mean that there is any 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.599
 interrelation with fans 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.890
 remember when I speak of tissues we are talking about the grouping of 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.469
 cells with functions and forms 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.489
 same 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.750
 in which what allows them to live are their intercellular substances 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.609
 or known as a matrix 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.649
 the Koreans 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.109
 are the product of different types of fabrics example 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.279
 when I'm talking 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:50.519
 of the liver 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.449
 when I speak for example and the heart 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.839
 a heart is made up of muscle tissue 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.530
 a nervous tissue 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.520
 a circulatory tissue an adipose tissue st 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.879
 Jordanians with similar functions are going to form systems 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.529
 and bad systems form a great unit 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:12.409
 machine
