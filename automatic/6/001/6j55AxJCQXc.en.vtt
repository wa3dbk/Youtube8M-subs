00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.360
 welcome to make magic fishtanktv today 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 I use a new rod 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.970
 called the with to moderate I fish with the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 three meter version but the series 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.470
 consists of three different english 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.330
 the lengths of 270 3 meters and 3 meters 30 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.670
 these rods are specially designed 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.670
 for fishing with a with tot 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.430
 but of course they are also extremely 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 suitable for fishing with a normal one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 wave 2 by weight of the rods is 20 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 up to 50 grams what makes these rods 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 well so good for fishing with that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.660
 simple that is the construction of the blank 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.690
 the blenk consists of two different ones 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.600
 portions the upper portion is beautiful 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.220
 soft has quite a bow 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 so is very capable of the aggressive 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.600
 bites perfectly 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.100
 Also the blows to be during the drill 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.110
 perfect by the rod 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.740
 recorded the lower part of the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.360
 rod on the other hand is a lot stiffer 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.670
 stiffer and that causes you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 I also have maximum control at the drill 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 of big fish 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.049
 moreover, it also makes inserting one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.049
 much easier 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.960
 the rods come with two tips 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.640
 First of all there is a somewhat frightened glass tip 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 pretty soft 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 perfect bending very beautiful 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.250
 bite registration 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
 In addition, there is a man half an ounce 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.229
 carbon tip 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.600
 a little faster a piece of penny 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.030
 perfect for throwing into larger ones 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.650
 distances or moments that some more 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.370
 voltage on the line from 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.900
 lifestream or wind 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.150
 have technical aspects besides the fish 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 We also looked at what people like 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.299
 see 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.640
 in terms of transport length, many people want 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.739
 gladly take the rod rigged 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.959
 well that is no problem we 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.459
 have designed the rods so that they 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.459
 consist of two equal parts 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.489
 including the top at the moment 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.340
 you the fishing rod 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.730
 rigged takes height top always 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.940
 neatly protected by the point section 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.440
 from heaven that is ideal 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.720
 in addition, these rods are very strong 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.160
 interestingly priced an absolute 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.160
