00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bomb I guess the Stone Age miss did

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
bomb I guess the Stone Age miss did
matter<00:01:27.590> because<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:28.710> could<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:28.950> killed<00:01:29.070> me

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

though he had two guys left so at that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.910 
though he had two guys left so at that
point<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.250> didn't<00:01:35.520> matter<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.630> tyrantrum<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
point it didn't matter so tyrantrum is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
point it didn't matter so tyrantrum is
gonna<00:01:38.130> die<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:40.110> gonna<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.530> that

comes<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.970> i'm<00:02:18.090> gonna<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.269> for<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> thunder

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
comes in i'm gonna go for a thunder

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220 
comes in i'm gonna go for a thunder
because<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.819> neutral<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.239> para<00:02:21.959> would

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
because it's neutral and the para would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.320 
because it's neutral and the para would
kind<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.709> be<00:02:22.830> nice<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.340> mostly<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.909> just<00:02:24.000> want

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
kind of be nice but mostly I just want

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.390 
kind of be nice but mostly I just want
to<00:02:24.390> damage<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:25.019> figured<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:25.950> was<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:26.220> no

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to damage I figured there was really no

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.350 
to damage I figured there was really no
point<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.760> switching<00:02:27.120> out<00:02:27.239> because<00:02:29.180> stuff<00:02:30.180> and
