great game

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.080 
great game
it<00:01:14.870> feels<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.440> little<00:01:15.590> bit<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.950> same<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.610> NBA

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
it feels a little bit the same as NBA

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.980 
it feels a little bit the same as NBA
2k12<00:01:17.630> right<00:01:18.200> now<00:01:18.670> some<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.850> same<00:01:20.090> moves<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
2k12 right now some of the same moves a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.690 
2k12 right now some of the same moves a
little<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.740> cheese<00:01:22.360> but<00:01:23.360> overall<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:24.700> gotta

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
little bit of cheese but overall I gotta

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.090 
little bit of cheese but overall I gotta
say<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.120> feels<00:01:26.180> more<00:01:26.570> like<00:01:26.630> NBA<00:01:27.080> 2k11<00:01:27.530> which<00:01:28.010> is

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
say it feels more like NBA 2k11 which is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.300 
say it feels more like NBA 2k11 which is
a<00:01:28.130> good<00:01:28.310> thing<00:01:28.370> because<00:01:29.150> NBA<00:01:29.600> 2k11<00:01:30.080> was<00:01:30.620> much

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
a good thing because NBA 2k11 was much

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.570 
a good thing because NBA 2k11 was much
better<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.940> my<00:01:32.060> opinion<00:01:32.090> than<00:01:32.600> NBA<00:01:32.810> 2k12<00:01:33.580> and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
better in my opinion than NBA 2k12 and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.350 
better in my opinion than NBA 2k12 and
so<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:35.360> very<00:01:35.420> happy<00:01:36.050> about<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:38.090> going

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
so I'm very happy about that it's going

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.120 
so I'm very happy about that it's going
