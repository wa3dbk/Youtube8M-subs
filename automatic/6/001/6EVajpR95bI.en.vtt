so fisheries for the deep-sea really

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.700 
so fisheries for the deep-sea really
probably<00:00:03.360> only<00:00:03.570> started<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> early<00:00:04.440> part<00:00:04.650> of

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
probably only started the early part of

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.349 
probably only started the early part of
the<00:00:04.799> last<00:00:04.830> century<00:00:05.069> maybe<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.879> middle<00:00:06.150> part

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the last century maybe the middle part

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.150 
the last century maybe the middle part
of<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.569> early<00:00:06.839> last<00:00:06.990> century<00:00:07.170> what<00:00:07.890> happens

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
of the early last century what happens

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.089 
of the early last century what happens
is<00:00:08.280> people<00:00:08.309> would<00:00:08.700> take<00:00:08.880> boats<00:00:09.500> let<00:00:10.500> go<00:00:10.710> as<00:00:10.889> far

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is people would take boats let go as far

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.919 
is people would take boats let go as far
as<00:00:11.219> they'd<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.639> go<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> catch<00:00:12.090> fishing<00:00:12.509> in

as they'd have to go to catch fishing in
the<00:00:13.080> old<00:00:13.230> days<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.590> wouldn't<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.040> go<00:00:14.130> very

the old days it wouldn't have to go very
far<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:15.450> we've<00:00:15.660> heavily<00:00:16.020> fished<00:00:16.260> insurer

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
and what happens is the fishery you just

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.490 
and what happens is the fishery you just
get<00:03:08.060> started<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.720> fisherman's<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> cat's

eye<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:10.130> catch<00:03:10.280> these<00:03:10.430> they<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.880> sell<00:03:11.060> them<00:03:11.270> I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
eye can catch these they can sell them I

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.199 
eye can catch these they can sell them I
can<00:03:11.720> distribute<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.730> we<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.120> don't

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
can distribute them but we really don't

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.580 
can distribute them but we really don't
know<00:03:14.360> much<00:03:14.480> about<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.170> fisheries

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
know much about it so the fisheries

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
some time to catch up they're better and

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.490

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
better at it with computers and new

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.710 
better at it with computers and new
