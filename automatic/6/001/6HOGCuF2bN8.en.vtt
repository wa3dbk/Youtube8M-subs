00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.220
 very good to all the kids we are 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.859
 back on my channel and how are you 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.200
 seeing we are with Chaco a subscriber 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.200
 he asked me to make a guide to Chaco and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.929
 well I'm going to do it I hope you like it 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.000
 and good until now let's start with the 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 passive stab in the back what 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.190
 makes this passive is that if we go by 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.590
 behind an enemy and we make 20% more 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.800
 of damage I think against subjects if 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.169
 it works 129 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.169
 116 if we go a little more damage 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.469
 let's move now to cheat this 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.170
 skill what it does is we become 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.320
 invisible is worth and our next 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.100
 basic attack for a critical attack 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 from 140 of 140 percent to level 1 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.310
 and if a critic comes out 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 of the object and we follow an infinite cold and 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 we put a critic for example that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.500
 critical are 200 percent at least of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 140% 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.070
 let's go now with the w 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.350
 surprise box sack what it does is put 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.530
 a little box here I'm going to put that one 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.900
 first one becomes invisible and if someone 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.650
 is about to get him to scrub a fear 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.050
 ok let's see it come here 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.340
 You put him in fear I tell a little bit and he makes 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.340
 magic damage with its attacks 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.480
 let's go now with the double poison 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.430
 edge 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.380
 this skill has a passion and a 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 active non- passive that our attack of 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 sack particles 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.280
 they put poison 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.420
 they slow them down and also when sticking them 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.180
 have a chance to fail the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.010
 minions let's see if a kilo of 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.990
 you failed 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.150
 I do not know if it will come out 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.610
 I'm going to paste this also fails this bad 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.360
 and its active sometimes a little away 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 OK 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.920
 the active one of these that makes you a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 knife that scales so much with one of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.099
 as with ap and slows it down 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.099
 how is your lover 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.020
 we do now with the ultimate r 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.900
 hallucination 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.690
 what it does is create a sack copy 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 It's worth hitting the same damage with that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 worker is 50% less damage and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.950
 lets go see it 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.700
 this insurance can be controlled 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.590
 explaining the r vale 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.030
 without clicking with the right click it is worth 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 the ere and with the alt with right click 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.250
 for me more comfortable this and when it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 time ends or you are killed exploits 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.519
 doing magical damage let's see the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.519
 eyes have died 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.350
 let's move now with the order skills 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.830
 that we have to climb up well what are you 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.840
 watching on screen is worth 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.180
 the jungle conseco what first we 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.700
 we have to go up is the w point to the wa 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.270
 level 1 to level 2 1 online 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.950
 at level 3 a point at q and then at 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.340
 level up 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.900
 ok we 'll give points to the air until 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.780
 that we can not more later we will go up 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.530
 the w and in the end we will end up the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.780
 the cv and at level 6 11 16 we 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.790
 we will go up the ultimate 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.770
 we go to the masters you are 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.850
 seeing on screen I guess they left them 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.120
 ratico vale 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.420
 and now we will go to the runes too 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.340
 he is living them 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.800
 and speaking of the summer there are very many 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.780
 runas I have put a couple the ones that 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.050
 like those of murcia with more balanced 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.910
 with defenses and such a little bit of damage the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.120
 Chaco that is much more aggressive for 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.659
 shatter 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.580
 julia enemy lines gives the same as they are 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.239
 my favorite ones that are speed of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.239
 damage attack 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.900
 and the 15 essences 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.780
 I would only because of the damage but also 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.960
 can put movement speed and 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.690
 good 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.160
 now let's move with the objects the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.360
 guild 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.020
 is also living on the screen 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.020
 I suppose 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.560
 and well I'm going to waste the video 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.280
 Isaco station I hope you have 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.830
