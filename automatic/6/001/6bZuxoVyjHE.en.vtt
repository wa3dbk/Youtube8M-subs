port inside the actual earphone which I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
which is very good so that means that

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.360 
which is very good so that means that
they<00:03:12.819> won't<00:03:13.139> get<00:03:14.139> damaged<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:14.859> break<00:03:15.129> very
