router table and then the other end of
the<00:01:39.299> extension<00:01:39.750> cord<00:01:39.930> comes<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.850> goes

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the extension cord comes out and it goes

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399 
the extension cord comes out and it goes
to<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> side<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:42.899> I'll<00:01:43.049> show<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to that side which I'll show you in just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.679 
to that side which I'll show you in just
a<00:01:43.619> second<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:45.530> let<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.390> Matt<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
a second so let me get up so as Matt the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
a second so let me get up so as Matt the
router<00:01:48.840> table<00:01:49.259> mice<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.040> underneath<00:01:50.460> in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
router table mice which is underneath in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.880 
router table mice which is underneath in
here<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.899> pointing<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> opposite

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
here and it's pointing the opposite

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.670 
here and it's pointing the opposite
direction<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.759> order<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> turn<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.680> router

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
direction so in order to turn the router

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
direction so in order to turn the router
table<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.640> underneath<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
table on you have to go underneath and

power<00:02:30.489> outlet<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.380> by<00:02:32.380> itself<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.040> very

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
power outlet is by itself it is very

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
power outlet is by itself it is very
tight<00:02:33.730> fitting<00:02:34.660> inside<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.200> back<00:02:35.410> rail<00:02:35.680> but

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
tight fitting inside this back rail but

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.250 
tight fitting inside this back rail but
I<00:02:36.100> made<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.580> really<00:02:37.060> snug<00:02:37.510> by<00:02:37.720> adding<00:02:38.020> some

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
I made it really snug by adding some

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.370 
I made it really snug by adding some
couple<00:02:39.190> layers<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.670> blue<00:02:40.090> painters<00:02:40.510> tape<00:02:40.540> so

couple layers of blue painters tape so

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.640 
couple layers of blue painters tape so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
for my tool that's plugged in won't pull

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.650 
for my tool that's plugged in won't pull
this<00:02:55.630> out<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.769> course<00:02:56.980> I've<00:02:57.130> got<00:02:57.660> another

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
this out and of course I've got another

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.270 
this out and of course I've got another
switch<00:02:59.080> for<00:02:59.319> all<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.560> these<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.980> what<00:03:00.100> this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
switch for all of these but what this

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.850 
switch for all of these but what this
does<00:03:00.489> mainly<00:03:01.090> lets<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> concern<00:03:02.500> about<00:03:02.650> that

me<00:03:05.319> 120<00:03:05.800> volt<00:03:05.980> power<00:03:06.160> right<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.300> middle<00:03:07.450> of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
me 120 volt power right in the middle of

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.150 
me 120 volt power right in the middle of
my<00:03:07.630> shop<00:03:07.900> without<00:03:08.110> using<00:03:08.410> any<00:03:08.650> extension

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
my shop without using any extension

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.090 
my shop without using any extension
cords<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.610> if<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:09.940> table<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:11.260> closer<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.040> I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
cords so if this table is closer to it I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.470 
cords so if this table is closer to it I
can<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.340> plug<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.640> sander<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:13.330> good

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
can just plug the sander in and I'm good

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.699 
can just plug the sander in and I'm good
to<00:03:13.569> go<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:16.120> course<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.530> red

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
to go but of course this is a this red

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.300 
to go but of course this is a this red
wires<00:03:17.950> just<00:03:18.870> 14<00:03:19.870> volt<00:03:20.170> I'm<00:03:20.500> sorry<00:03:20.739> 14<00:03:21.100> gauge

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
wires just 14 volt I'm sorry 14 gauge

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.390 
wires just 14 volt I'm sorry 14 gauge
wire<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.120> i<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.140> limited<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.620> 15<00:03:24.070> amps

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
wire so i think it's limited to 15 amps

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.759 
wire so i think it's limited to 15 amps
which<00:03:24.610> i<00:03:24.940> don't<00:03:25.720> think<00:03:25.870> i'll<00:03:26.079> ever<00:03:26.140> run<00:03:26.410> 15

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
which i don't think i'll ever run 15

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.530 
which i don't think i'll ever run 15
amps<00:03:27.040> through<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.459> wire<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.850> i<00:03:27.880> think<00:03:28.209> one

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
amps through that wire and i think one

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.479 
amps through that wire and i think one
of<00:03:28.600> these<00:03:28.780> little<00:03:28.959> power<00:03:29.200> surge<00:03:29.920> protectors

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
of these little power surge protectors

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.550 
of these little power surge protectors
is<00:03:30.610> probably<00:03:30.940> less<00:03:31.120> than<00:03:31.180> 12<00:03:31.630> or<00:03:31.900> less<00:03:32.079> than<00:03:32.260> 15

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
is probably less than 12 or less than 15

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.410 
is probably less than 12 or less than 15
amps<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:34.140> anyway<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.350> got<00:03:35.769> router<00:03:36.329> got<00:03:37.329> the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
amps so anyway I got router got the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.300 
amps so anyway I got router got the
router<00:03:37.600> table<00:03:37.989> powered<00:03:38.530> up<00:03:38.680> which<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.070> my<00:03:39.280> main

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
router table powered up which is my main

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.880 
router table powered up which is my main
concern<00:03:39.850> today<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.540> hope<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.440> guys<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.769> had

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
concern today and hope you guys have had
