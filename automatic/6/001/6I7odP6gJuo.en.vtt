00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.089
 web video for yourself the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 present video is dedicated to how 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.540
 check the electrical contacts of a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 country or stratum of washing machine in others 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 videos you 've already seen how to check the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.359
 membrane or how to check other models 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 of data people today has touched 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.930
 this one that recently I was having a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.970
 co -worker 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.210
 this prisoner is as much as we see he has 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.070
 four contacts I would touch bring a red 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.940
 contact here but do not have it 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.460
 I am spelling 2 and that is in contact 16 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.860
 as we see we have the contact 16 below 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.079
 I would have another 16 above repeated that I would not 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.089
 has contact 11 on the 14th and the 12th we're going 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.450
 to proceed to check them for 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.330
 know what corresponds to what 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.210
 for this we are going to help a couple 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.340
 of elements the first is a sheet for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.579
 point out the contacts we have and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.739
 to know 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.260
 that would be everything we have the 16 and the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.380
 eleven 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.369
 the 14th 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.369
 and the 12 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.110
 let's start making 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.240
 checks to see which of those two 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.220
 contacts give us on the scale of measurement 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 of diodes to give us beep and be 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.030
 more comfortable 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 and we proceed to check we check the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 below with one of the newspapers in between 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.490
 nothing nothing nothing we check the second 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.800
 with the rest 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 whistle 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.870
 let's check the third with the fourth and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.030
 nothing therefore the second with the 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.030
 fourth we have asked 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.859
 we will mark 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.870
 second with this one 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.640
 we will check both what the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.030
 which performs the switching therefore 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.680
 we will help with a syringe and a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.670
 small soft tube 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 by the tube 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.820
 which detects the air pressure 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.820
 and we push until they click 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.480
 we leave the syringe 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.900
 we have said that between the second and the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.680
 fourth there was continuity we have 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.569
 now 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.740
 so we have between the second and the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.990
 third 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.400
 this what we deduce is that the second 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.170
 contact is the common and the computed it 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 is doing between the third and the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.530
 quarter 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.510
 that is to say 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 the term eleven would be the common 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.610
 here is a computer 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.920
 and here would be the other terminal of that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.209
 lifetime 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.280
 we have said that it performs the commutation 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.270
 In a second 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.270
 and the butt 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.099
 therefore in clock 11 and 14 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.090
 let go of the syringe 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.080
 and we have to commute and we have 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.560
 passed up 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.560
 to terminal 12 therefore 12 is 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.250
 NC normally closed and this is not 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.650
 normally in open 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.120
 we still have to finish 16 we will see the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 terminal 16 what is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.010
 we see that it has no continuity with 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.370
 none of us press the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.370
 syringe 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.099
 yes 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.140
 gives us continuity with two terminals 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.510
 remember that when you have computed 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.510
 commute the second with the third 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.610
 so if it gives us continuity 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.670
 it would be a contact 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.120
 eleven 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.650
 16 we have already obtained the scheme 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.650
 from our house state 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.210
 our steps both have four 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.110
 contacts of those four contacts on 11 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.110
 the second 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.300
 it is the common terminal 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.880
 the one below the second one below is the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.470
 common terminal is usually 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.740
 closed in rest position with the 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.750
 terminal 12 for the top one would close 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.620
 this circuit at the time of applying 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 air and switch commutes from 12 to 14 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.840
 here 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.610
 and in turn makes a second 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.860
 switching between 11 and 16 around here 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.009
 therefore the state prison 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.390
 activated we have this road closed and 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.390
 this other road closed 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.340
 I hope that the little clarification and the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.860
 country check if you can 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.510
 be helpful and that more or less you see that 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.760
 all are checked in the same way 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.400
 only that they can change 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.380
 contacts that each one has, I hope that 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.180
 the video can be of help to you 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.690
 I show how you can do it in a way 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.960
 homemade and simple and it is only to put 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.670
 hands to work to get checked 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.950
 your weight is everything to look at the others 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.540
 videos that I have on the subject and you will see 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.300
 other checks that can be 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.070
 make a greeting and I hope you continue 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.340
 visiting the website because to 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.340
 everyone
