00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.459 

1<00:04:09.489> 2<00:04:09.610> phase<00:04:09.849> 3<00:04:09.879> which<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.659> just<00:04:10.989> more<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.349> the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:11.469 
1 2 phase 3 which is just more of the

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:19.800 
1 2 phase 3 which is just more of the
same<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.519> basically<00:04:19.000> we're<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.239> gonna<00:04:19.449> run

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
same so basically we're just gonna run
