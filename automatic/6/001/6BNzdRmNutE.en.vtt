meaning for me this big question um I

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.010 
meaning for me this big question um I
don't<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.400> know

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
don't really know

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.940 

honestly<00:02:55.360> i'll<00:02:56.360> probably<00:02:56.780> just<00:02:56.990> lyin<00:02:57.770> lyin

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
honestly i'll probably just lyin lyin

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.330

lyin<00:02:58.220> lyin<00:02:58.730> till<00:02:59.390> they<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.720> 18<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.500> then<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
lyin lyin till they like 18 and then the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.970 
lyin lyin till they like 18 and then the
truth<00:03:01.580> will<00:03:01.640> come<00:03:01.850> out<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.680> know
