and you can tie it on your bands or run
your<00:02:06.450> -<00:02:06.659> straight<00:02:07.320> through<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:07.770> hole

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
your - straight through that little hole

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.699 
your - straight through that little hole
there<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.970> easy<00:02:09.119> also

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
there just as easy also

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.080 
there just as easy also
when<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.099> tie<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.580> bands<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:11.970> use

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
when you tie on your bands you can use

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.930 
when you tie on your bands you can use
elastics<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.140> use<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.610> string<00:02:14.610> use

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
elastics you can use a string use

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.530 
elastics you can use a string use
anything<00:02:15.150> that's<00:02:15.330> available<00:02:15.569> work<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.500> fine

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
anything that's available work just fine

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.039 
anything that's available work just fine
all<00:02:18.540> right

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
all right

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.899 
all right
so<00:02:19.769> how<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.099> use<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.519> these<00:02:20.640> things

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
so how do you use one of these things

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.539 
so how do you use one of these things
it's<00:02:21.540> pretty<00:02:21.780> simple<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.340> what's

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
it's pretty simple and that's what's

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.199 
it's pretty simple and that's what's
good<00:02:23.700> about<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
good about it

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.920 
good about it
simple<00:02:24.750> works<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:27.269> want<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> use<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.720> one

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
simple works you want to use the one

simple works you want to use the one
line<00:02:28.140> aiming<00:02:28.590> system<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
line aiming system when you do this so I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
line aiming system when you do this so I
so<00:02:31.709> you're<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> target<00:02:32.250> okay<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.879> look<00:02:33.599> at<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
so you're the target okay I look at you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.350 
so you're the target okay I look at you
I<00:02:34.140> don't<00:02:34.319> want<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> hit<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.000> is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
I don't want to hit you so what I do is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.680 
I don't want to hit you so what I do is
I<00:02:36.510> pull<00:02:37.410> back<00:02:38.030> slingshot<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> side<00:02:39.480> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I pull back slingshot to the side like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.660 
I pull back slingshot to the side like
this<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.739> make<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.340> looks<00:02:41.519> to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this and I make it so that it looks to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.630 
this and I make it so that it looks to
my<00:02:41.819> dominant<00:02:42.329> eye<00:02:42.769> like<00:02:43.769> there's<00:02:44.129> one<00:02:44.370> band

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
my dominant eye like there's one band

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.759 
my dominant eye like there's one band
underneath<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.299> eye<00:02:45.329> okay<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.530> looks<00:02:46.739> like

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
underneath my eye okay so looks like

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.250 
underneath my eye okay so looks like
there's<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.190> band<00:02:47.400> under<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:47.819> eye<00:02:47.900> when<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> aim

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
there's one band under my eye when I aim

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.670 
there's one band under my eye when I aim
all<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.099> do<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.670> place<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.120> target<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
all I do is just place the target in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.000 
all I do is just place the target in the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
center of this band and make this look

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.089 
center of this band and make this look
like<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.220> line<00:02:56.609> or<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> barrel<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.840> rifle<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.920> my

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
like a line or a barrel of a rifle to my

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.430 
like a line or a barrel of a rifle to my
eye<00:02:59.129> okay<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.060> I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440

gently barely touch my cheekbone to the
edge<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.760> band<00:03:09.299> right<00:03:09.510> here<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.930> allows

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
edge of this band right here that allows

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.050 
edge of this band right here that allows
me<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.829> almost<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.370> same<00:03:11.760> thing<00:03:11.940> as

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
you have a cheek weld on your rifle I do

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.280 
you have a cheek weld on your rifle I do
it<00:03:14.730> right<00:03:14.819> here<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.060> touch<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.079> can<00:03:16.200> look

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.839 
it right here I touch it and I can look
along<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.680> band<00:03:16.889> very<00:03:17.160> effectively<00:03:17.609> very

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
along that band very effectively very

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.120 
along that band very effectively very
easily

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
easily

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.339 
easily
excuse<00:03:20.130> me<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.150> don't<00:03:21.329> hit<00:03:21.660> your<00:03:21.690> cheekbone

you can't hit your face when you shoot
like<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:25.010> because<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.250> simple<00:03:26.700> geometry

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
like that because it's simple geometry

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.190 
like that because it's simple geometry
here<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:29.700> contraction<00:03:30.389> happens<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.109> you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
here is the contraction happens when you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.680 
here is the contraction happens when you
release

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.890 

the<00:03:36.430> v-shape<00:03:37.430> that's<00:03:37.670> formed<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.480> smaller

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
the v-shape that's formed is smaller

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.750 
the v-shape that's formed is smaller
smaller<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:39.920> goes<00:03:40.070> right<00:03:40.250> past<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.610> face

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
smaller and it goes right past your face

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.360 
smaller and it goes right past your face
without<00:03:41.000> ever<00:03:41.210> touching<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:42.500> really<00:03:43.190> safe

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
without ever touching so really safe

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.440 
without ever touching so really safe
that<00:03:43.580> way<00:03:43.810> very<00:03:44.810> easy<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.670> accuracy<00:03:46.670> that's

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
that way very easy to do accuracy that's

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.020 
that way very easy to do accuracy that's
what<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.720> thing's<00:03:47.960> made<00:03:48.140> for<00:03:49.030> reliability

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
what this thing's made for reliability

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.250 
what this thing's made for reliability
that's<00:03:50.810> what<00:03:50.990> it's<00:03:51.110> good<00:03:51.260> at<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:54.170> you

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that's what it's good at and so what you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
gonna shoot slightly below this maybe

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.740 
gonna shoot slightly below this maybe
once<00:04:51.680> or<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.430> might<00:04:52.790> just<00:04:53.030> feel<00:04:53.180> confident<00:04:53.630> just

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
once or I might just feel confident just

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.970 
once or I might just feel confident just
bring<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:53.990> straight<00:04:54.050> into<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.530> light<00:04:54.830> at

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
bring it straight into it just light at

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.480 
bring it straight into it just light at
the<00:04:55.070> first<00:04:55.280> try<00:04:55.490> we'll<00:04:56.210> see<00:04:56.920> how<00:04:57.920> I<00:04:57.950> feel<00:04:58.070> when

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
the first try we'll see how I feel when

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.870 
the first try we'll see how I feel when
I'm<00:04:58.580> shooting<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:00.800> anyway<00:05:01.040> imagine<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:01.640> is

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
I'm shooting but anyway imagine this is

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
the eye or the ear canal won't shoot

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:28.159 
the eye or the ear canal won't shoot
just<00:05:05.420> like<00:05:05.600> that

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.629 

and<00:05:29.169> it<00:05:29.289> was<00:05:29.409> easy<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.770> hit<00:05:30.009> first<00:05:30.699> try

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.360

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.939 
right on the tip there I'm gonna check
to<00:05:36.400> see<00:05:36.610> if<00:05:36.669> there's<00:05:36.819> any<00:05:37.259> white<00:05:38.259> lifts<00:05:38.530> on<00:05:38.770> it

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
to see if there's any white lifts on it

yeah you can see where where I'd inked

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.730 
yeah you can see where where I'd inked
it<00:05:41.919> there<00:05:42.129> but<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:42.430> didn't<00:05:43.289> did<00:05:44.289> knock<00:05:44.469> all<00:05:44.650> the

white off so what I'll do is I'll try it

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.050 
white off so what I'll do is I'll try it
one<00:05:46.240> more<00:05:46.270> time<00:05:47.430> what<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.460> wanted<00:05:48.759> to<00:05:48.849> do<00:05:48.939> is

Portability<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:37.520> do<00:06:38.520> believe<00:06:38.940> it's<00:06:39.500> one<00:06:40.500> of

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
Portability and I do believe it's one of

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.290 
Portability and I do believe it's one of

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
if not the best slingshots out there

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.740 
if not the best slingshots out there
right<00:06:42.479> now<00:06:42.509> it<00:06:43.199> allows<00:06:43.440> you<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.860> greatest

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
right now it allows you the greatest

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.029 
right now it allows you the greatest
platform<00:06:45.750> for<00:06:45.990> a<00:06:46.020> pure<00:06:46.289> precision<00:06:46.860> and

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
platform for a pure precision and

platform for a pure precision and

that<00:06:49.440> well<00:06:50.310> guys<00:06:50.490> I<00:06:50.820> guess<00:06:50.970> that's<00:06:51.300> about<00:06:51.389> it

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
that well guys I guess that's about it

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.150 
that well guys I guess that's about it
this<00:06:51.810> must<00:06:52.050> be<00:06:52.259> open<00:06:53.240> and<00:06:54.860> like<00:06:55.860> I<00:06:55.979> say<00:06:56.130> I

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
this must be open and like I say I

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.240 
this must be open and like I say I
wouldn't<00:06:56.580> be<00:06:56.699> doing<00:06:56.910> the<00:06:56.970> video<00:06:57.180> right<00:06:57.360> now

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
wouldn't be doing the video right now

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.800 
wouldn't be doing the video right now
except<00:06:59.250> that<00:06:59.370> I<00:06:59.460> have<00:06:59.490> a<00:06:59.639> we<00:07:00.240> do<00:07:00.389> have<00:07:00.570> one

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
except that I have a we do have one

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.990 
except that I have a we do have one
particular<00:07:01.139> guy<00:07:01.440> and<00:07:01.770> he's<00:07:02.310> getting<00:07:02.729> ready<00:07:02.820> to

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
particular guy and he's getting ready to

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.230 
particular guy and he's getting ready to
deploy<00:07:03.690> and<00:07:04.500> he<00:07:04.919> wants<00:07:05.190> that<00:07:05.310> video<00:07:05.550> right<00:07:05.880> now

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
deploy and he wants that video right now

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.810 
deploy and he wants that video right now
so<00:07:06.990> that's<00:07:07.410> what's<00:07:07.710> up<00:07:07.889> that's<00:07:08.250> up<00:07:08.490> that's
