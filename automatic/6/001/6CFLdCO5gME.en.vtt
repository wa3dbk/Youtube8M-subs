there a lot of the stuff gets on the
rims<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.849> then<00:03:42.849> you<00:03:42.910> want<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.090> also<00:03:43.420> remove

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
rims and then you want to also remove

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.440 
rims and then you want to also remove
the<00:03:43.780> air<00:03:43.930> bubbles<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.790> most<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.120> these<00:03:46.239> I've

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the air bubbles so most of these I've

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.449 
the air bubbles so most of these I've
done<00:03:46.860> I'm<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:48.010> going<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.160> give<00:03:48.280> them<00:03:48.340> another

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
done I'm just going to give them another

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.759 
done I'm just going to give them another
shot<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.150> lot<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.390> these<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:50.410> don't<00:03:50.590> really

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
shot and a lot of these you don't really

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.140 
shot and a lot of these you don't really
have<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.980> put<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.250> much<00:03:51.310> water<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:51.970> them

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
have to put that much water in them

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.680 
have to put that much water in them
because<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.629> tomatoes<00:03:53.049> are<00:03:53.830> pretty<00:03:54.160> watery

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
because the tomatoes are pretty watery

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.539 
because the tomatoes are pretty watery
themselves<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.950> now<00:03:57.040> we're<00:03:57.160> putting<00:03:57.310> them<00:03:57.430> in

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
themselves so now we're putting them in

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.820 
themselves so now we're putting them in
the<00:03:57.640> water<00:03:57.790> bath<00:03:58.360> canner<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.989> they'll<00:03:59.620> go<00:03:59.709> in

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
the water bath canner and they'll go in

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.100 
the water bath canner and they'll go in
there<00:03:59.980> for<00:04:00.160> 45<00:04:00.459> minutes<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> quartz<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
there for 45 minutes for the quartz and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.979 
there for 45 minutes for the quartz and
for<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.160> pints<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:03.700> do<00:04:03.819> for<00:04:04.150> about<00:04:04.239> believe

for the pints you do for about believe

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.830 
for the pints you do for about believe
35<00:04:05.440> minutes<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:07.540> when<00:04:07.660> they're<00:04:07.810> done

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
35 minutes and then when they're done

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.569 
35 minutes and then when they're done
just<00:04:08.319> set<00:04:08.470> them<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.769> towel<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.430> your

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.030 
countertop to cool and then the lids
will<00:04:12.819> seal<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:16.630> I've<00:04:16.840> taken<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.200> jars<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.889> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
will seal so I've taken the jars of the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.000 
will seal so I've taken the jars of the
canner<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.810> unfortunately<00:04:19.810> we<00:04:19.989> lost<00:04:20.169> two<00:04:20.650> of

they go on the canner and as you can see
that<00:04:55.479> is<00:04:55.570> how<00:04:55.720> we<00:04:55.780> can<00:04:56.080> our<00:04:56.229> Tomatoes<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.860> helps
