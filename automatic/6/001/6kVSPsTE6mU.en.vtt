00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
way of stabilizing our costs that's you

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.560 
way of stabilizing our costs that's you
know<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.680> one<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> main<00:04:37.670> one<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.480> the

know the one of the main one of the
major<00:04:38.780> difficulties<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.500> actually<00:04:39.950> having<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
major difficulties is actually having a

stability in the revenue streams and in

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.480 
stability in the revenue streams and in
the<00:04:41.840> costumes<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.860> very<00:04:43.040> difficult<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
the costumes that is very difficult to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.520 
the costumes that is very difficult to
plan<00:04:43.640> if<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.630> access<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> Champions<00:04:45.470> League

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.590 
plan if you access the Champions League
or<00:04:45.800> not<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.730> gives<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.150> difference<00:04:47.480> of

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
or not it gives you a difference of

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.240 
or not it gives you a difference of
about<00:04:47.690> 30<00:04:48.170> million<00:04:48.410> on<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.890> next<00:04:49.100> year's
