I'm gonna show you a very unique way of
pulling<00:00:09.480> dents<00:00:09.870> out<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.349> car<00:00:10.559> doing<00:00:11.040> some

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
pulling dents out of your car doing some

pulling dents out of your car doing some
bodywork<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> Porsche<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.450> before<00:00:12.780> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
bodywork on the Porsche here before I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.570 
bodywork on the Porsche here before I
paint<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.920> thought<00:00:14.099> you'd<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.429> see

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
paint it and I thought you'd like to see

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240 
paint it and I thought you'd like to see
this<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.890> edge<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this right here I at the edge of the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.980 
this right here I at the edge of the
quarter<00:00:17.460> panel<00:00:17.820> nothing<00:00:18.180> has<00:00:18.300> been<00:00:18.480> hit<00:00:18.750> but

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
quarter panel nothing has been hit but

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.269 
quarter panel nothing has been hit but
as<00:00:19.170> soon<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> door<00:00:20.010> panel

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
as soon as we get to the door panel

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
as soon as we get to the door panel
right<00:00:20.939> along<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.449> line

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
right along this line

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.300 
right along this line
something<00:00:22.350> hit<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.010> happened

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
something hit this and this happened

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.230 
something hit this and this happened
before<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.550> bought<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> car<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.000> don't<00:00:24.119> know

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
before I bought the car I don't know

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.689 
before I bought the car I don't know
what<00:00:24.539> did<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.769> hit<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> frame<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
what did it but it hit the frame of the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
what did it but it hit the frame of the
door<00:00:26.849> now<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> frame<00:00:27.539> may<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
door now the frame may not be what you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.599 
door now the frame may not be what you
think<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.250> some

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
think it is it's really just some

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
think it is it's really just some
corrugated<00:00:29.910> sheet<00:00:30.390> metal<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> make<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.439> more

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
corrugated sheet metal to make it more

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
corrugated sheet metal to make it more
rigid<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.399> area<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
rigid in that area so there's also a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
rigid in that area so there's also a
frame<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.170> runs<00:00:34.530> along<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.399> underneath

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
frame that runs along the underneath

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
frame that runs along the underneath
this<00:00:36.390> trim<00:00:37.110> piece<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.680> why<00:00:37.920> that's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
this trim piece so that's why that's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
this trim piece so that's why that's
rigid<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> here

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
rigid but like you see here

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
rigid but like you see here
it's<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.320> sheet<00:00:40.890> metal<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> point

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it's just sheet metal up to this point

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.650 
it's just sheet metal up to this point
now<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.260> wet<00:00:43.500> core<00:00:43.710> unit

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
now here it's not as wet core unit

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.869 
now here it's not as wet core unit
ribbons<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.760> I'm

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
ribbons so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
ribbons so what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually<00:00:47.969> gonna<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> stick<00:00:48.930> welder<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
actually gonna take a stick welder and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
actually gonna take a stick welder and
I'm<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> sand<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I'm going to sand off a little bit of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
I'm going to sand off a little bit of
well<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.219> chip<00:00:53.760> mark<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.239> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
well there's a little chip mark here so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
well there's a little chip mark here so
I<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.539> use<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> bare<00:00:55.829> metal

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I can use that so this is a bare metal

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
I can use that so this is a bare metal
then<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.879> gonna<00:00:57.030> stick<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.350> end<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> my

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
then I'm gonna stick the the end of my

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
then I'm gonna stick the the end of my
electrode<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.730> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.359> frame<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> I'm

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
electrode right on the frame and I'm

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
electrode right on the frame and I'm
gonna<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.920> wealth<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.730> weld<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> sense

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
gonna not wealth not weld in the sense

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
gonna not wealth not weld in the sense
that<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.870> normally<00:01:04.019> weld<00:01:04.470> where<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that you would normally weld where you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
that you would normally weld where you
create<00:01:05.189> an<00:01:05.309> arc<00:01:05.580> I'm<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> gonna

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
create an arc I'm actually just gonna

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539 
create an arc I'm actually just gonna
touch<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.229> end<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> electrode<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
touch the end of the electrode to it and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.649 
touch the end of the electrode to it and
hold<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> there<00:01:08.880> until<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.180> gets<00:01:09.299> hot<00:01:09.450> enough

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
hold it there until it gets hot enough

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
hold it there until it gets hot enough
that<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> fuses<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.520> when

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that kind of fuses you know like when

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250 
that kind of fuses you know like when
your<00:01:11.760> electrode<00:01:12.119> sticks<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> whatever<00:01:12.930> you're

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
your electrode sticks to whatever you're

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.920 
your electrode sticks to whatever you're
welding<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:15.299> my

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
welding then I'm going to take my

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
welding then I'm going to take my
electrode<00:01:16.680> holder<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.909> lets

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
electrode holder off of it it just lets

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.660 
electrode holder off of it it just lets
stick<00:01:18.650> stay<00:01:19.650> there<00:01:19.890> against<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> doorframe

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
stick stay there against the doorframe

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.620 
stick stay there against the doorframe
then<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.229> take<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.090> slider<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then I'm gonna take a slider and put it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
then I'm gonna take a slider and put it
on<00:01:24.720> plier<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.140> you'll<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
on plier so you'll see what I'm gonna do

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
on plier so you'll see what I'm gonna do
here<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> second<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.750> I've<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.140> stick

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here in a second so I've got my stick

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
here in a second so I've got my stick
electrode<00:01:28.860> set<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.310> i<00:01:29.490> I've<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.630> ground

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
electrode set up i I've got my ground

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
electrode set up i I've got my ground
underneath<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> car<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.040> really

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
underneath the car here you can really

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.059 
it off and that may be you know that may
work<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.269> well<00:02:52.450> but<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.440> really<00:02:53.739> want<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.950> make

sure you cause minimal damage to the
actual<00:02:56.170> metal<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:57.100> that's<00:02:57.459> no<00:02:57.700> fun<00:02:57.970> when

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
actual metal because that's no fun when

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.180 
actual metal because that's no fun when
it<00:02:58.269> comes<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.320> know<00:02:59.350> getting<00:02:59.769> this<00:02:59.859> smooth

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
it comes to you know getting this smooth

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.610 
it comes to you know getting this smooth
in<00:03:00.400> when<00:03:00.549> you're<00:03:00.670> ready<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.970> paint<00:03:01.410> okay<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.470> I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
in when you're ready to paint okay so I

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.590 
in when you're ready to paint okay so I
used<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.980> slide<00:03:03.250> hammer<00:03:03.430> technique<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
used a slide hammer technique with the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.449 
used a slide hammer technique with the
welding<00:03:04.930> stick<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.470> pull<00:03:05.709> out<00:03:05.890> most<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.310> this

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
welding stick to pull out most of this

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.580 
welding stick to pull out most of this
dent<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.030> no<00:03:07.239> matter<00:03:07.420> what<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.500> know

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
dent but no matter what you you know

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.140 
dent but no matter what you you know
you're<00:03:08.799> welding<00:03:09.040> onto<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.579> sheet<00:03:09.760> metal<00:03:09.880> so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you're welding onto the sheet metal so

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.370 
you're welding onto the sheet metal so
you're<00:03:10.269> not<00:03:10.390> gonna<00:03:10.600> end<00:03:10.780> up<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.079> perfect

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
you're not gonna end up with a perfect

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.890 
you're not gonna end up with a perfect
result<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:12.310> from<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.730> technique<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.660> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
result just from that technique so you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.120 
result just from that technique so you
need<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.200> use<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.319> little<00:03:14.500> bit<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.739> body<00:03:14.859> filler

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
need to use a little bit of body filler

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.009 
need to use a little bit of body filler
I'll<00:03:15.400> use<00:03:15.549> bondo<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.120> got<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.480> from<00:03:16.569> autozone

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
I'll use bondo I got it from autozone

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.390 
I'll use bondo I got it from autozone
you<00:03:17.230> can<00:03:17.350> get<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.500> from<00:03:17.590> Walmart<00:03:17.829> Meyer

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
you can get it from Walmart Meyer

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.910 
you can get it from Walmart Meyer
wherever<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:20.049> then<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.650> you

wherever and then what you do is you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.890 
wherever and then what you do is you
spread<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.459> there<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.819> use<00:03:22.389> a<00:03:22.420> shaping

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
spread it on there and use a shaping

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.050

great before it's all the way dry I mean
it's<00:03:25.510> almost<00:03:25.690> dry<00:03:26.049> it's<00:03:26.290> just<00:03:26.440> kind<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.680> you

it down to the general shape that you

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.520 
it down to the general shape that you
want<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.690> use<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> hard<00:03:32.170> sanding

want it to be and you use a hard sanding
block<00:03:32.709> after<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.329> but<00:03:34.329> up<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
block after that but up here it's just

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.800 
block after that but up here it's just
just<00:03:36.160> about<00:03:36.340> right<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.760> down<00:03:37.329> here<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.630> can

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
just about right and down here I can

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.539 
just about right and down here I can
sense<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.350> there's<00:03:38.530> like<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> dip<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.160> can<00:03:39.310> feel

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
sense that there's like a dip I can feel

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.550 
sense that there's like a dip I can feel
with<00:03:39.730> my<00:03:39.910> hand<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.720> I'm<00:03:40.840> gonna<00:03:40.930> new<00:03:41.109> do<00:03:41.380> another

have<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.750> trim<00:03:44.290> up<00:03:44.319> this<00:03:44.829> edge<00:03:45.160> here<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:46.090> it'll

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
have to trim up this edge here and it'll

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.240 
have to trim up this edge here and it'll
be<00:03:46.329> all<00:03:46.420> set<00:03:46.690> right<00:03:47.530> now<00:03:47.590> we're<00:03:47.829> gonna<00:03:47.920> do<00:03:48.100> this

be all set right now we're gonna do this
little<00:03:48.459> dip<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:49.180> I'll<00:03:49.239> show<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.420> how<00:03:49.540> it's

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
little dip here I'll show you how it's

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.379 
little dip here I'll show you how it's
done<00:03:49.920> typically<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.280> makes<00:03:51.519> things<00:03:51.790> easier<00:03:52.209> if

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
done typically it makes things easier if

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.910 
done typically it makes things easier if
you<00:03:52.540> use<00:03:52.780> something<00:03:53.139> like<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.290> board<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:53.889> this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
you use something like a board like this

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.820 
you use something like a board like this
to<00:03:54.819> mix<00:03:55.030> your<00:03:55.150> body<00:03:55.359> filler

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
to mix your body filler

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.130 
to mix your body filler
I<00:03:55.920> used<00:03:56.610> something<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.060> plastic<00:03:57.510> spoon<00:03:57.780> so

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
I used something like a plastic spoon so

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.420 
I used something like a plastic spoon so
that<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> can<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.710> throw<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.950> away<00:03:59.040> when<00:03:59.130> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that I can just throw it away when it's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.790 
that I can just throw it away when it's
done<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.050> just<00:04:01.050> get<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> little<00:04:01.260> bit<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.620> out<00:04:01.770> of

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
done and just get a little bit of out of

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.240 
done and just get a little bit of out of
there<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.340> put<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.530> mixing<00:04:04.950> area

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
there and put it on your mixing area

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
there and put it on your mixing area
here<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.870> mix<00:04:07.020> your<00:04:07.290> hardener

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
here and then you just mix your hardener

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.170 
here and then you just mix your hardener
with<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.540> start<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:11.610> before<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.030> put

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
with it and start just before you put

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.880 
with it and start just before you put
your<00:04:12.300> hardener<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.960> want<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.200> twist<00:04:13.710> it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
your hardener in you want to twist it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.890 
your hardener in you want to twist it
and<00:04:13.950> squeeze<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.340> like<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.760> because<00:04:15.000> it

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
and squeeze it like this because it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.680 
and squeeze it like this because it
always<00:04:16.170> is<00:04:16.799> real<00:04:17.280> watery<00:04:17.730> inside<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.420> unless

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
always is real watery inside and unless

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.539 
always is real watery inside and unless
you<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.830> then<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.040> take<00:04:20.190> your<00:04:20.340> board

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
you do this so then you take your board

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.240 
you do this so then you take your board
after<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.420> put<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> little<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:22.920> they<00:04:23.070> say

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
after that put a little bit on they say

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.830 
after that put a little bit on they say
about<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:24.330> know<00:04:24.420> you<00:04:24.510> got<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> read<00:04:24.810> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
about you know you got to read the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.330 
about you know you got to read the
package<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> think<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:25.710> package<00:04:26.130> says

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
package but I think this package says

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.910 
package but I think this package says
about<00:04:26.550> half<00:04:26.790> an<00:04:27.030> inch<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.450> every<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.890> know

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
about half an inch for every you know

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.190 
about half an inch for every you know
bit<00:04:29.580> about<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.000> size<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.420> golf<00:04:30.660> ball<00:04:30.750> but

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
bit about the size of a golf ball but

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.270 
bit about the size of a golf ball but
it's<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.250> little<00:04:32.370> bit<00:04:32.580> smaller<00:04:33.230> anyway<00:04:34.280> you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's a little bit smaller anyway you

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.160 
it's a little bit smaller anyway you
just<00:04:35.340> got<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.610> read<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.820> package<00:04:36.180> figure<00:04:37.020> out

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
just got to read the package figure out

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.530 
just got to read the package figure out
what<00:04:37.350> your<00:04:37.560> ratio<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.670> supposed<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.300> and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
what your ratio is supposed to be and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.450 
what your ratio is supposed to be and
then<00:04:40.200> take<00:04:40.470> your<00:04:40.590> spreader<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.220> think<00:04:41.370> these

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
then take your spreader you think these

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.130 
then take your spreader you think these
spreaders<00:04:41.910> also<00:04:42.270> at<00:04:42.390> autozone<00:04:42.780> or<00:04:42.960> wherever

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
spreaders also at autozone or wherever

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.530 
spreaders also at autozone or wherever
they're<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.920> couple<00:04:44.190> bucks<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:45.390> just

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
they're just a couple bucks you just

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.930 
they're just a couple bucks you just
kind<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.780> mix<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.230> just<00:04:46.530> like<00:04:46.620> as<00:04:47.130> if<00:04:47.760> you're

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940

doing<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.350> putty<00:04:49.770> for<00:04:51.110> drywall<00:04:52.130> that's

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
doing you know putty for drywall that's

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.340 
doing you know putty for drywall that's
that's<00:04:53.490> really<00:04:53.670> all<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.570> trying<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.900> do<00:04:55.080> here

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350

have a couple minutes to work otherwise

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.110 
have a couple minutes to work otherwise
this<00:05:01.590> stuff<00:05:01.800> will<00:05:01.919> harden<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.550> make<00:05:03.000> it

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
this stuff will harden up and make it

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.730 
this stuff will harden up and make it
impossible<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.630> get<00:05:03.780> a<00:05:03.810> smooth<00:05:04.080> surface<00:05:04.380> so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
impossible to get a smooth surface so

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.880 
impossible to get a smooth surface so
I'm<00:05:05.370> just<00:05:05.520> going<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.910> go<00:05:06.060> ahead<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.450> apply<00:05:06.690> it

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
I'm just going to go ahead and apply it

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.920 
I'm just going to go ahead and apply it
directly<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.720> area<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:11.780> make<00:05:12.780> sure

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
directly to the area and make sure

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.920 
directly to the area and make sure
things<00:05:13.169> are<00:05:13.260> nice<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.680> smooth<00:05:14.510> based<00:05:15.510> on<00:05:15.750> what

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
things are nice and smooth based on what

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.900 
things are nice and smooth based on what
I<00:05:15.960> felt<00:05:16.530> before<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:20.040> then<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.580> should<00:05:20.820> be

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
I felt before and and then I should be

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.790 
I felt before and and then I should be
good<00:05:21.120> just<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.450> leave<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.690> for<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.560> little<00:05:22.680> bit

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
good just to leave it for a little bit

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.430 
good just to leave it for a little bit
to<00:05:23.040> dry<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.970> then<00:05:24.720> come<00:05:24.960> back<00:05:24.990> with<00:05:25.320> the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
to dry and then come back with the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.909 
to dry and then come back with the
shaper<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.640> in<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.090> sanding

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.309 

it's<00:05:33.430> important<00:05:33.879> to<00:05:33.939> make<00:05:34.750> sure<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.169> your

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
it's important to make sure that your

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.559 
it's important to make sure that your
shape<00:05:35.590> is<00:05:35.770> close<00:05:36.219> while<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:37.180> still<00:05:37.360> wet

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
shape is close while it's still wet

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:38.700 
shape is close while it's still wet
otherwise<00:05:37.930> you're<00:05:38.110> gonna<00:05:38.169> do<00:05:38.379> a<00:05:38.409> lot<00:05:38.680> of

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
otherwise you're gonna do a lot of

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.260 
otherwise you're gonna do a lot of
shaping<00:05:39.219> and<00:05:39.340> sanding<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:39.819> get<00:05:39.939> it<00:05:40.030> back<00:05:40.180> to

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
shaping and sanding to get it back to

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.510 
shaping and sanding to get it back to
where<00:05:40.389> you<00:05:40.449> actually<00:05:40.629> want<00:05:40.990> it<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.110> be<00:05:41.460> okay<00:05:42.460> so

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
where you actually want it to be okay so

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.459 
where you actually want it to be okay so
this<00:05:42.819> is<00:05:43.000> done<00:05:43.180> drying<00:05:43.419> but<00:05:43.689> it<00:05:43.870> really<00:05:44.169> never

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
this is done drying but it really never

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.730 
this is done drying but it really never
needed<00:05:45.009> to<00:05:45.310> have<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.479> shaper<00:05:46.960> tool<00:05:47.139> used<00:05:47.560> on

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
needed to have the shaper tool used on

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.339 
needed to have the shaper tool used on
it<00:05:47.860> because<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.490> got<00:05:49.090> it<00:05:49.300> close<00:05:49.780> enough<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
it because I got it close enough to the

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.689 
it because I got it close enough to the
shape<00:05:50.560> while<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:50.860> was<00:05:50.979> all<00:05:51.159> still<00:05:51.400> wet<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.669> I

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
shape while it was all still wet and I

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.209 
shape while it was all still wet and I
just<00:05:51.879> did<00:05:52.030> it<00:05:52.120> with<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.419> putty<00:05:52.900> enough<00:05:53.349> so<00:05:53.740> I'm

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
just did it with the putty enough so I'm

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.129 
just did it with the putty enough so I'm
just<00:05:54.340> gonna<00:05:54.430> go<00:05:54.639> ahead<00:05:54.759> and<00:05:54.909> move<00:05:55.449> straight<00:05:55.780> to

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
just gonna go ahead and move straight to

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.499 
just gonna go ahead and move straight to
the<00:05:56.349> hard<00:05:56.740> block<00:05:57.009> sander<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.969> what<00:05:58.090> we<00:05:58.180> do<00:05:58.330> is

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
the hard block sander and what we do is

00:05:58.509 --> 00:05:59.879 
the hard block sander and what we do is
just<00:05:58.719> press<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.080> straight<00:05:59.169> against<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.740> body

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
just press it straight against the body

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.499 
just press it straight against the body
and<00:06:01.439> start<00:06:02.439> working<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.800> back<00:06:02.949> and<00:06:03.129> forth<00:06:03.509> and

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
and start working it back and forth and

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.769 
and start working it back and forth and
this<00:06:05.020> hard<00:06:05.259> block<00:06:05.439> has<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:05.889> has<00:06:06.279> a<00:06:06.779> screen

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779 
this hard block has that has a screen

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:09.990 
this hard block has that has a screen
sander<00:06:08.289> on<00:06:08.319> it<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:08.830> I<00:06:09.129> don't<00:06:09.580> need<00:06:09.789> to<00:06:09.849> use

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
sander on it so I don't need to use

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.760 
sander on it so I don't need to use
water<00:06:10.210> with<00:06:10.479> this<00:06:10.629> particular<00:06:11.500> type<00:06:11.740> of

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
water with this particular type of

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.719 
water with this particular type of
sandpaper<00:06:12.370> but<00:06:13.060> I<00:06:13.120> do<00:06:13.240> want<00:06:13.599> to<00:06:13.629> keep

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
sandpaper but I do want to keep

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.929 
sandpaper but I do want to keep
alternating<00:06:15.729> between<00:06:17.340> sanding<00:06:18.340> and<00:06:18.490> feeling

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939 
alternating between sanding and feeling

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.640 
alternating between sanding and feeling
it<00:06:19.029> because<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:19.750> want<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:20.229> make<00:06:20.409> sure<00:06:20.560> I'm

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650
