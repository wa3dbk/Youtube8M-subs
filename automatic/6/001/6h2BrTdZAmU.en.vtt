00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 Have you heard about the css energy storage system 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.090
 Ess, basically, when electric power demand is low , 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.859
 Increase energy efficiency by using saved power when large 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.240
 Energy storage facilities that serve to prepare for power outages in case of emergency 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 By mass secondary battery that we grunting used in mobile phones mp3 laptop 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 Large energy storage devices are gathered 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.730
 The small secondary battery is assembled, the tray being serie of a train of four shelves 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.829
 Neck together in the form of a large container in a large secondary battery charging 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 It's a system. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.270
 I use a lot of electricity every day in many places. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 Electricity usage will continue to rise and the earth's greenhouse gases will increase, but without electricity 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.780
 You can not buy it. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.840
 Currently , a substation regenerating voltage from a large power plant to a large invoice tower, Regina 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.370
 Until the use of general electricity , enormous energy is wasted. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:05.440
 But now it diverges to increase the confidence of the electrical efficiency of the Smart groove 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.440
 As infrastructure becomes available, renewable energy, solar wind power 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.210
 It is to take advantage of the aid, etc. Now also uses intelligent energy 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.360
 But where do these self- produced energies go? 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.530
 That's right. 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.640
 Energy is always available through the essence of each building. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.790
 Not only material produced energy is being flooded when walking in the ess 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.790
 It can be sent back to the power company to prevent waste of energy. 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:39.030
 This saves electricity and does not require you to build large power plants anymore. 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.030
 Being 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:50.070
 It is also possible to reduce the mouse gas through all of the ess 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 In essence, Es reduces electricity demand difference at night, 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.720
 Sometimes we charge for time. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.170
 It is a core essence of Smart Grid .
