gun has already been emptied so that's

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:17.350 
gun has already been emptied so that's
fine<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:14.689> next<00:01:15.439> thing<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.710> do<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:17.060> remove

the<00:01:17.720> trigger<00:01:18.110> blade<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:19.009> weak<00:01:19.159> point<00:01:19.189> it's

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the trigger blade it's a weak point it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.350

made<00:01:20.180> out<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.360> plastic<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:21.980> it<00:01:22.370> can<00:01:22.880> very

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
made out of plastic and it's it can very

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.840 
made out of plastic and it's it can very
easily<00:01:23.630> get<00:01:23.840> damaged<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.350> postage<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:24.980> you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
easily get damaged in postage so you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.149 
easily get damaged in postage so you
need<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.920> PZ

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
screw of it and then it should just

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.140 
screw of it and then it should just
slide<00:01:32.690> off<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.729> either<00:01:37.820> keep

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
slide off like that you can either keep

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.610 
slide off like that you can either keep
