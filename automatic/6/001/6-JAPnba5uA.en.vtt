00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
hey guys today I'm just gonna do a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.820 
hey guys today I'm just gonna do a
little<00:00:07.710> update<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.870> some<00:00:09.870> stuff<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.349> doing<00:00:10.679> on

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
little update on some stuff I'm doing on

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.089 
little update on some stuff I'm doing on
the<00:00:11.010> water-cooled<00:00:11.910> machine<00:00:12.769> right<00:00:13.769> now<00:00:13.950> I'm

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the water-cooled machine right now I'm

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
the water-cooled machine right now I'm
waiting<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.849> motherboard<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.900> come<00:00:16.049> back

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
waiting for the motherboard to come back

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.029 
waiting for the motherboard to come back
from<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.650> soos<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.460> warranty<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> p5

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
from a soos from warranty one of the p5

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.929 
from a soos from warranty one of the p5
and<00:00:20.070> -<00:00:20.880> DS<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.100> got<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> water<00:00:23.490> cooling

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and - DS so we got the water cooling

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
and - DS so we got the water cooling
system<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> thought<00:00:25.109> while<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.470> was

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
system out and I thought while it was

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
system out and I thought while it was
out<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> might<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.670> time<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.300> give<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
out it might be a good time to give you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
out it might be a good time to give you
a<00:00:28.439> closer<00:00:28.769> look<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> system<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.210> lot<00:00:30.510> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
a closer look at the system a lot of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
a closer look at the system a lot of
people<00:00:30.929> ask<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:31.410> water<00:00:31.859> cooling<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
people ask me about water cooling this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
people ask me about water cooling this
is<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:33.750> simple<00:00:34.200> system<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is a very simple system this is the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.350 
is a very simple system this is the
thermal<00:00:35.430> take<00:00:35.790> big<00:00:36.059> water<00:00:36.380> 735<00:00:38.000> not<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> whole

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
thermal take big water 735 not a whole

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
thermal take big water 735 not a whole
lot<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:41.160> reservoir<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
lot to it this is your reservoir that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.290 
lot to it this is your reservoir that
holds<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.390> fluid<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> pump<00:00:44.399> attaches<00:00:45.270> right

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
holds your fluid the pump attaches right

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.770 
holds your fluid the pump attaches right
to<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.820> pumps<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> fluid<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> hose

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to that and pumps the fluid up the hose

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500 
to that and pumps the fluid up the hose
right<00:00:49.200> through<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.620> water<00:00:49.920> block<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> then

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
right through your water block and then

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.810 
right through your water block and then
the<00:00:51.750> fluid<00:00:52.469> comes<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> water<00:00:53.399> block

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the fluid comes out of the water block

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.689 
the fluid comes out of the water block
into<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.510> radiator<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:56.340> from<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
into your radiator and then from the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
into your radiator and then from the
radiator<00:00:57.149> back<00:00:57.539> into<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> reservoir<00:00:58.469> itself

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
radiator back into the reservoir itself

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.790 
radiator back into the reservoir itself
so<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> closed-loop<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> just

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so it's a closed-loop system it just

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000 
so it's a closed-loop system it just
keeps<00:01:02.010> recirculating<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> water<00:01:03.120> around<00:01:04.010> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
keeps recirculating the water around the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
keeps recirculating the water around the
radiator<00:01:05.339> itself<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.330> mounted<00:01:06.510> inside

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
radiator itself can be mounted inside

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.770 
radiator itself can be mounted inside
the<00:01:07.290> case<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.830> outside<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> case<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the case or outside the case and it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
the case or outside the case and it's
got<00:01:10.020> mounting<00:01:10.950> holes<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> fan<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
got mounting holes for the fan so you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.010 
got mounting holes for the fan so you
could<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> fan<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.360> inside<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.689> use<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
could put a fan on the inside and use it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.260 
could put a fan on the inside and use it
at<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> push<00:01:16.799> air<00:01:16.979> through<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.549> or

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
at you know to push air through it or

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.480 
at you know to push air through it or
you<00:01:18.479> could<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> fan<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.590> outside<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you could put a fan on the outside of it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
you could put a fan on the outside of it
and<00:01:20.520> pull<00:01:21.030> air<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.780> depending<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> how

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and pull air through it depending on how

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
and pull air through it depending on how
much<00:01:23.310> room<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> system

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
much room you got what kind of system

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.730 
much room you got what kind of system
you<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> water<00:01:28.080> blocks<00:01:28.500> are

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you want to use the water blocks are

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
you want to use the water blocks are
kind<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> nice<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.670> I'll<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.570> can

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
kind of nice on these I'll see if we can

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
kind of nice on these I'll see if we can
get<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.020> shot<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.220> uses<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.610> nice

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
get a good shot of that it uses a nice

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
get a good shot of that it uses a nice
solid<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.630> copper<00:01:34.140> water<00:01:34.409> block<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
solid all copper water block and then it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.870 
solid all copper water block and then it
has<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> see-through<00:01:36.840> acrylic<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.729> other

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
has a see-through acrylic on the other

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
has a see-through acrylic on the other
side<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> little

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
side you can see the all the little

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.980 
side you can see the all the little
channels<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> fluid<00:01:42.270> actually<00:01:42.450> runs

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
channels where the fluid actually runs

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.069 
channels where the fluid actually runs
through<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> comes<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.119> hole<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
through so as it comes into one hole it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
through so as it comes into one hole it
goes<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> forth<00:01:46.950> through<00:01:47.399> them

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
goes back and forth through them

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.260 
goes back and forth through them
channels<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.140> second<00:01:49.920> hose<00:01:50.270> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
channels and then out the second hose so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480 
channels and then out the second hose so
that<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> water<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:52.770> has<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> few

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that the water actually has a few

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
that the water actually has a few
moments<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> stay<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.780> pull<00:01:55.049> some

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
moments to stay in there and pull some

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.820 
moments to stay in there and pull some
of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> jam

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
of the jam

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.680 
of the jam
years<00:01:56.040> old<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.730> runs<00:01:59.970> off<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.300> a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
years old and it just runs off of a

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.030 
years old and it just runs off of a
simple<00:02:01.320> molex<00:02:02.130> connector<00:02:03.440> here's<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.590> plugin

for<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.370> pump<00:02:05.730> itself<00:02:07.040> it's<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.580> running

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
for the pump itself it's just running

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.860 
for the pump itself it's just running
off<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.540> 12<00:02:09.930> volt<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.450> then<00:02:12.450> there's<00:02:12.660> also

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
off a 12 volt and then there's also

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
off a 12 volt and then there's also
another<00:02:13.350> plug-in<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.650> waterblock<00:02:16.650> itself

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
another plug-in on the waterblock itself

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460 
another plug-in on the waterblock itself
and<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.120> basically<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.870> light<00:02:19.230> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and this is just basically to light it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740 
and this is just basically to light it
there's<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> blue<00:02:20.250> LED<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there's like a blue LED in there that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.920 
there's like a blue LED in there that
lights<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.380> acrylic<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:23.130> blue<00:02:23.840> when<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
lights this acrylic of blue when the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.460 
lights this acrylic of blue when the
system<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.350> running<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.570> it's<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.170> not<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
system is running so it's it's not a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.620 
system is running so it's it's not a
great<00:02:28.890> system<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> real<00:02:30.060> high-end

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
great system it's not a real high-end

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.450 
great system it's not a real high-end
system<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.560> good<00:02:31.740> starter<00:02:32.250> system

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
system but it's a good starter system

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.699 
system but it's a good starter system
for<00:02:32.940> somebody<00:02:33.750> wanting<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.290> into<00:02:34.530> water

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709

cooling<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.209> expensive<00:02:37.910> great

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
cooling it's not that expensive great

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.420 
cooling it's not that expensive great
for<00:02:39.209> cooling<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.660> CPU<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.740> might<00:02:40.980> even<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.280> able

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
for cooling a CPU you might even be able

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.600 
for cooling a CPU you might even be able
to<00:02:41.550> do<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.180> CPU<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.380> video<00:02:43.680> card<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.370> not

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
to do a CPU and a video card I'm not

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.699 
to do a CPU and a video card I'm not
sure<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.120> doing<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.690> CPU<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.500> one

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
sure I'm just doing the CPU on this one

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.170 
sure I'm just doing the CPU on this one
so<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.670> how<00:02:47.820> many<00:02:48.030> different

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
so I don't know how many different

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090 
so I don't know how many different
components<00:02:49.020> you'd<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.320> able<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.709> actually

components you'd be able to actually

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.850 
components you'd be able to actually
cool<00:02:50.370> efficiently<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:52.290> I've<00:02:52.440> had<00:02:52.650> no

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
cool efficiently with it but I've had no

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.130 
cool efficiently with it but I've had no

problems with it as far as just the CPU

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520

out and painted them yellow and then did

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.850 
out and painted them yellow and then did
the<00:03:15.390> center's<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.350> black<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:17.489> match<00:03:17.790> this
