00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.570 

take<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> look<00:04:18.620> at<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.859> display<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:20.810> says

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
take a look at the display it says

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.810 
take a look at the display it says
left<00:04:23.180> on<00:04:23.389> Center<00:04:23.840> Drive<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.770> 1/8<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.550> mile

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.000 

actually<00:04:29.690> it's<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.960> lot<00:04:30.080> less<00:04:30.290> than<00:04:30.530> 1/8<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.890> a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
actually it's a lot less than 1/8 of a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.270 
actually it's a lot less than 1/8 of a
mile<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:33.260> other<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.680> would<00:04:33.860> have<00:04:33.890> said<00:04:34.190> how

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
mile the other one would have said how

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.100 
mile the other one would have said how
many<00:04:34.340> feet<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.850> is<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.180> will<00:04:35.360> change<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.870> feet

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
many feet it is this will change to feet

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.810 
many feet it is this will change to feet
probably<00:04:36.440> when<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:36.890> get<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.160> little<00:04:37.310> bit<00:04:37.550> closer

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
probably when we get a little bit closer

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.240 
probably when we get a little bit closer
the<00:04:38.690> distance<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.260> go<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.680> Walmart<00:04:39.890> is

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
the distance to go to the Walmart is

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.140 
the distance to go to the Walmart is
actually<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.640> third<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.180> mile

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.880 

so<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.300> know<00:04:47.480> we<00:04:47.630> have<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.900> go<00:04:48.020> left<00:04:48.230> here<00:04:48.910> and

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
so we know we have to go left here and

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.960 
so we know we have to go left here and
I'm<00:04:51.890> not<00:04:52.280> trusting<00:04:53.090> my<00:04:53.270> GPS<00:04:54.130> because<00:04:55.130> my<00:04:55.370> GPS

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
I'm not trusting my GPS because my GPS

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.700 
I'm not trusting my GPS because my GPS
is<00:04:56.000> telling<00:04:56.540> me<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.720> go<00:04:56.930> an<00:04:57.050> eighth<00:04:57.200> of<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.500> mile

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
is telling me to go an eighth of a mile

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.530 
is telling me to go an eighth of a mile
so<00:04:58.130> I'm<00:04:58.340> going<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.580> go<00:04:58.730> an<00:04:58.880> eighth<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.300> mile

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
so I'm going to go an eighth of a mile

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.160 
so I'm going to go an eighth of a mile

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
you can reprogram these but sometimes

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.230 
you can reprogram these but sometimes
you<00:06:39.150> can<00:06:39.300> reprogram<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:40.190> tom-toms
