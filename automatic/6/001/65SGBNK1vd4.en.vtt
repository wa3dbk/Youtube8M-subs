they had like sick flames on the sides
then<00:01:19.830> I'd<00:01:19.950> look<00:01:20.159> cool<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> FAA<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.060> finally

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
then I'd look cool the FAA is finally

but by the time they did it was obsolete
then<00:01:36.329> Amazon<00:01:36.780> took<00:01:36.960> their<00:01:37.110> testing<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> Canada

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
