00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.040
 hi i am barbaric and we are in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.490
 measuring laboratory look for mica 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.520
 a professional school for bartenders 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.440
 what we're going to see today will do 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 a mixing and molecular of a 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.720
 drink that is a real street and the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 molecular is a science that studies i 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.340
 physical and chemical changes that 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.380
 occur inside the food or 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.330
 of liquids in this case we will go to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.860
 see inside the posters e 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.260
 happen thanks to the council of 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.350
 we already have certain daring 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.040
 We have the calcium bath preparation 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.540
 put 400 ml of water with 2 grams of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.900
 calcium chloride and another vessel 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.570
 which contains only water 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.910
 then we will go to rescue the spheres 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.610
 now instead we do the preparation with 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.570
 the peron that is the base one prepared for 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.720
 the specification that there are two shows 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.720
 really 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 with half a gram of sodium alginate 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:26.800
 and let's mix everything to start 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.750
 we are going to put it in a container 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.750
 from which we will then stick to the spheres 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.940
 we will go to menton liquid of the molds 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.780
 details that will help us 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:48.280
 to specify 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:51.940
 the word and we will go to half of it 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:57.159
 inside the hot chico bath a lot 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.470
 quickly and what we will get 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.869
 will be balls are kitchen 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.460
 openwork we go to take stay e 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.310
 we can do it in the water 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.940
 because the calcium bath leaves us a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.940
 bitter taste 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:19.570
 so we know them with the same 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.870
 compound we go to do others 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.840
 spheres that will remain at the bottom of the del 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.780
 drink because we made him rest 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.069
 inside the fridge then air 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.470
 due to mixing and will be gone 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.940
 and these new spheres will no longer remain 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 afloat but will go to point a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.410
 to settle the fund if we remove from the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.269
 We are going to rinse the calcium bath 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:56.079
 inside the water and then we have 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.970
 found our bank to create the 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.239
 our brink we will go opponents 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.310
 inside the glass the prosecco al 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.820
 which we will add the spheres of 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.329
 aperol we try to get to the middle 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.329
 glass with prosecco 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.299
 wanting we can also add us 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:28.939
 dell'aperol obviously is not a sphere for 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:32.450
 to give better taste we add of the 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.310
 soda as you can see we have some 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.329
 surface spheres of expenses on the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.459
 background 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.400
 we have obtained the expenses on the fund 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.579
 making liquid stand in the fridge 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.170
 so that the air is evaporated is 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.290
 gone away 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.209
 and while we are here we must stay 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.790
 stress and therefore remain expressed by us 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.319
 arrives in the surface 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.939
 if you want to learn how to do copper 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.750
 molecular you can come and visit us at 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.750
 set to search there
