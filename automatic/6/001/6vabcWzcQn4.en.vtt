00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
like that actually I think transcends

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.290 
like that actually I think transcends
that<00:00:53.910> those<00:00:54.329> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> simple<00:00:56.300> references

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that those kind of simple references

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
equals this because I I think this is a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.600 
equals this because I I think this is a
pretty<00:01:03.420> strong<00:01:03.570> debut<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.949> starts

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
pretty strong debut and it really starts

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.410 
pretty strong debut and it really starts

saw bought takes a song and he kind of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.170 
saw bought takes a song and he kind of
slows<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.170> dials<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> back

much more emotional by taking out some

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.380 
much more emotional by taking out some

on top of some electro pop arrangements
the<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.090> final<00:03:20.420> two<00:03:20.540> tracks<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:20.959> here<00:03:21.110> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the the final two tracks on here the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.220 
the the final two tracks on here the
back<00:03:21.410> half<00:03:21.650> shoot<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.400> run<00:03:22.549> in<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.090> life<00:03:23.299> are

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
back half shoot and run in this life are

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.720 
back half shoot and run in this life are
a<00:03:24.290> little<00:03:24.530> bit<00:03:24.709> gloomy<00:03:24.950> or<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> little<00:03:25.640> bit

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
a little bit gloomy or a little bit

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.130 
a little bit gloomy or a little bit
moodier<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.510> think<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:27.019> where

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
moodier and so I think this is where

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.690 
moodier and so I think this is where
people<00:03:27.470> who<00:03:27.560> compare<00:03:27.860> him<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.130> Lana<00:03:28.310> Del<00:03:28.489> Rey

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
people who compare him to Lana Del Rey

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.590 
people who compare him to Lana Del Rey
are<00:03:29.000> probably<00:03:29.329> they're<00:03:29.450> probably

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
are probably they're probably

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.380 
are probably they're probably
referencing<00:03:30.140> these<00:03:30.350> tracks<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.180> fact

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
referencing these tracks and in fact

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.590 
referencing these tracks and in fact
that<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> first<00:03:32.959> single<00:03:33.290> off<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:34.760> EP<00:03:35.269> was

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
that the first single off of this EP was

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.660 
that the first single off of this EP was
shouldn't<00:03:36.320> run<00:03:36.530> even<00:03:37.190> though<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:37.400> that

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
shouldn't run even though I think that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.210 
shouldn't run even though I think that
it<00:03:37.760> might<00:03:38.630> actually<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.829> weakest

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
it might actually be the the weakest

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.850 
it might actually be the the weakest
track<00:03:40.459> here<00:03:41.090> which<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.989> not<00:03:42.200> saying<00:03:42.530> much

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
track here which is not saying much

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.440 
track here which is not saying much
because<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:44.170> good<00:03:45.170> EP<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.299> know<00:03:47.390> I

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
because this is a good EP but you know I

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.650 
because this is a good EP but you know I
feel<00:03:47.900> like<00:03:48.340> these<00:03:49.340> group<00:03:49.820> this<00:03:50.090> whatever<00:03:50.480> he

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
feel like these group this whatever he

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.449 
feel like these group this whatever he
is<00:03:50.930> able<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.260> bask<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.829> atmosphere<00:03:52.370> of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
is able to bask in the atmosphere of

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.020 
is able to bask in the atmosphere of
this<00:03:52.640> he<00:03:53.150> does<00:03:53.390> make<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.769> most<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.519> guess

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
this he does make the most of it I guess

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.840 
this he does make the most of it I guess
it's<00:03:56.630> just<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:57.310> compared<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> first<00:03:58.670> two

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
it's just that compared to the first two

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.130 
it's just that compared to the first two
tracks<00:03:59.060> these<00:03:59.420> two<00:03:59.600> tracks<00:03:59.810> suffer<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.510> you

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
tracks these two tracks suffer but you

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.569 
tracks these two tracks suffer but you
know<00:04:03.260> overall<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.890> know<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.040> think<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.489> a

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
know overall you know I think this is a
