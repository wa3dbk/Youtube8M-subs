 it shows the games that are 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.840
 installed on my pc of course he 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.700
 recognized all but for example if he 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 did not recognize everyone you come here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.680
 icon and look here for the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.320
 If you are not here, you can click 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.020
 add game goes there looking for us 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 paste the game and add it here 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.600
 manually but the main games 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.090
 they are here and you can do it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.979
 work that the schema is for application 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.930
 improve the performance of your game take 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 a bit of legco you have to start the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.939
 game here you come here choose 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 the game will have a play button by clicking 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.079
 on here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.290
 Eliabe the game here and it improves the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:58.860
 performance of your game and utilities and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:03.170
 here is the automatic option that does this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.829
 Basically I'll leave it here on 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.629
 it automatically improves performance 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.120
 of my games how does this improvement 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.380
 basically basically talks about ten 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200
 times but finally 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.760
 it disables all applications that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.320
 are turning from behind but it is so from the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.380
 windows things that are not being 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.620
 used at the time it dates program 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.780
 are also being used moment 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.150
 disables much in the system 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.190
 windows to improve the performance of your 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.560
 game what it does and frees memory 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.620
 free space for your game to roll 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.710
 better and have less leg or depending 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.140
 of the game has no leg and has the option 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.990
 of you to boot is a manual that comes 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.850
 here click on it deplete before you start 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.500
 the game and it makes here the whole process 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.420
 but I recommend leaving here at 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.890
 automatic is when you make the brain 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.830
 I play here 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.350
 it automatically removes all 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.840
 processes that are not being 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.510
 used moment both here the process 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.070
 services and everything else is running 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.770
 no windows 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.330
 up here has other tools 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.820
 diagnosis because it can give a 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.530
 look and here's it in cast that I 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.640
 I think it's cool, it has nothing to do with 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.950
 improve performance 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.960
 but you can for example capture here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 the game place have the same function as the 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.970
 fred do you can do around here not 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.720
 leave the function so I do not know if it works 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.340
 well or not but it has that function too 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.870
 remembering that you create an account but it is 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.850
 easy when you start with the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.830
 application and the option to 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.450
 you have a flickr account there 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.300
 a confirmation email for 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.450
 it's possible you put it there 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.900
 that the account you activate and ready can already 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.000
 access and the application and then use 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.480
 I recommend to anyone who has problem with 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.410
 Oleg the game is stuck or I do not know 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.660
 it's hard to try 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.600
 I think you're going to give a good help like this. 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.060
 is the root is a very strong brand in the area 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.160
 of games, nor did she make a 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.530
 Okay, okay, so this is it. 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.610
 post there has a download link for me 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.370
 I'm staying here 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.370
 A big hug and thanks
