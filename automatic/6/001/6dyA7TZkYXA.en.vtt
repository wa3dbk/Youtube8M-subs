bye so Lindsey is super excited about

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.050 
bye so Lindsey is super excited about
the<00:05:10.940> poster<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.630> brought<00:05:12.760> for<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.910> house

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
the poster that I brought for the house

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.600 
the poster that I brought for the house
so<00:05:14.870> this<00:05:15.230> will<00:05:15.470> probably<00:05:15.890> be<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.160> background

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
so this will probably be the background

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.200 
so this will probably be the background
for<00:05:16.850> most<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.210> my<00:05:17.300> videos<00:05:17.780> now<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:20.030> actually

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
for most of my videos now and I actually

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.780 
for most of my videos now and I actually
will<00:05:20.660> probably<00:05:21.020> do<00:05:21.170> an<00:05:21.500> extra<00:05:21.920> video<00:05:22.220> about

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
will probably do an extra video about

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.310 
will probably do an extra video about
some<00:05:23.150> of<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.330> One<00:05:23.450> Direction<00:05:23.480> things<00:05:24.110> that

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
some of the One Direction things that

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.070 
some of the One Direction things that
