with<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.199> chips<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:17.970> we're<00:00:18.180> ready<00:00:18.300> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
with our chips so now we're ready this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
with our chips so now we're ready this
is<00:00:19.050> just<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.410> extra<00:00:19.710> virgin<00:00:19.890> olive<00:00:20.100> oil<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
is just some extra virgin olive oil and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
is just some extra virgin olive oil and
we're<00:00:21.090> probably<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> put<00:00:21.810> about<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
we're probably going to put about a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.759 
we're probably going to put about a
couple<00:00:23.640> teaspoons<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.350> this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
couple teaspoons of it or so and this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.310 
couple teaspoons of it or so and this
stuff<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> great<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:28.140> can

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
stuff is great because it really you can

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
stuff is great because it really you can
use<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> ground<00:00:29.039> beef<00:00:29.250> substitute<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
use it as a ground beef substitute and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
use it as a ground beef substitute and
just<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.179> anything<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.260> meatloaf

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
just about anything from like meatloaf

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.120 
just about anything from like meatloaf
to<00:00:32.189> pasta<00:00:32.640> dishes<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.739> people<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:34.860> really

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to pasta dishes and people don't really

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
to pasta dishes and people don't really
notice<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> difference<00:00:35.700> too<00:00:36.180> much<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.899> now

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
notice the difference too much and now

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.600 
notice the difference too much and now
what<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.399> add<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
what I'm going to do I'm going to add a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
what I'm going to do I'm going to add a
little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> paprika<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.809> cumin<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> once

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
little bit of paprika and cumin and once

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
little bit of paprika and cumin and once
again<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.430> other<00:00:41.579> spices<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
again if there are other spices that you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
again if there are other spices that you
really<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> hot<00:00:43.950> or

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
really like or if you like a hot or

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
really like or if you like a hot or
pepper<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.730> certainly<00:00:45.059> feel<00:00:45.270> free<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
pepper you can certainly feel free to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
pepper you can certainly feel free to
add<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.770> find<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.700> dry<00:00:47.940> spices

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
add that I find that with dry spices

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
add that I find that with dry spices
it's<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> toast<00:00:49.260> them<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> oil<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's good to toast them in the oil a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
it's good to toast them in the oil a
little<00:00:50.190> bit<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.969> brings<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> flavors

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
little bit really brings out the flavors

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
little bit really brings out the flavors
as<00:00:52.170> opposed<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> sprinkling<00:00:53.340> am<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.579> top<00:00:53.820> at

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
as opposed to sprinkling am on top at

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.110 
as opposed to sprinkling am on top at
the<00:00:54.120> end<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> i<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.829> say<00:00:56.070> probably<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the end so i would say probably this is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
the end so i would say probably this is
really<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.719> taste<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:59.010> maybe<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
really to your taste but maybe a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
really to your taste but maybe a
tablespoon<00:00:59.699> each<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> paprika<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
tablespoon each of the paprika and the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
tablespoon each of the paprika and the
cuban<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> your

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
cuban and that really is up to your

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
cuban and that really is up to your
taste<00:01:04.409> i<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> certainly<00:01:05.040> put<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.760> less

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
taste i can certainly put more or less

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.800 
taste i can certainly put more or less
depending<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.659> has

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
depending on what you like and this has

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.210 
depending on what you like and this has
been<00:01:12.930> cooking<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.530> three<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.070> four

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
been cooking for about three or four

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
been cooking for about three or four
minutes<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.080> notice<00:01:16.080> some<00:01:16.350> parts<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
minutes and notice some parts of this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
minutes and notice some parts of this
are<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.369> bit<00:01:17.549> browner<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:18.000> others

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
are a little bit browner than others

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690 
are a little bit browner than others
it's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.229> hard<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.040> that's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it's a little bit hard to see but that's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's a little bit hard to see but that's
kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.840> done<00:01:22.610> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
kind of how you know when it's done so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
kind of how you know when it's done so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
minutes and so I'm just lifting it up to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
minutes and so I'm just lifting it up to
see<00:02:06.360> how<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.659> doing<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> you'll<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.530> it's

see how it's doing and you'll see it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.730 
see how it's doing and you'll see it's
definitely<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.340> less<00:02:08.610> volume<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.330> blood

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
definitely got less volume of blood

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.620 
definitely got less volume of blood
than<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:09.950> had<00:02:10.100> before<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:11.030> another<00:02:11.270> thing<00:02:11.390> I'm

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
noticing as I stir this around is that i

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.400 
noticing as I stir this around is that i
think<00:02:14.030> i<00:02:14.480> would<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.110> some<00:02:15.380> more

tomatoes in here and that's going to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.450 
tomatoes in here and that's going to
depend<00:02:17.330> also<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.290> consistency<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.010> your

need<00:03:13.730> some<00:03:14.330> are<00:03:14.480> more<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> sauce<00:03:15.140> which<00:03:15.500> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
need some are more like a sauce which is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.900 
need some are more like a sauce which is
what<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.310> some<00:03:16.430> are<00:03:16.550> more<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
what this is and some are more like a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.450 
what this is and some are more like a
spread<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:18.290> these<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.830> just<00:03:18.980> put<00:03:19.160> directly

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
spread so these we can just put directly

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.520 
spread so these we can just put directly
into<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.910> dish<00:03:25.630> this<00:03:26.630> cheese<00:03:26.930> by<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.260> way<00:03:27.410> it

into the dish this cheese by the way it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.960 
into the dish this cheese by the way it
doesn't<00:03:27.740> that<00:03:27.890> it's<00:03:28.040> not<00:03:28.160> required<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.730> it

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
doesn't that it's not required that it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.460 
doesn't that it's not required that it
needs<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.240> be<00:03:29.360> cooked<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:30.020> product<00:03:30.380> you

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
needs to be cooked it's a product you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.680 
needs to be cooked it's a product you
can<00:03:30.560> eat<00:03:30.710> straight<00:03:31.040> from<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.520> dish<00:03:32.240> if<00:03:32.510> you'd

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
can eat straight from this dish if you'd

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.300 
can eat straight from this dish if you'd
like<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.110> like<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.890> cook<00:03:34.010> all<00:03:34.190> these

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
like I like to cook all these

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.590 
like I like to cook all these
ingredients<00:03:34.490> because<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.180> i<00:03:35.330> said<00:03:35.360> it's

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
ingredients because like i said it's

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300 
ingredients because like i said it's
simpler<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:36.710> dish<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.190> that's

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
simpler so it's in one dish and that's

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.300 
simpler so it's in one dish and that's
all<00:03:37.490> ready<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:37.760> me<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.030> go<00:03:38.380> also<00:03:39.380> things<00:03:40.070> once

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
all ready for me to go also things once

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.560 
all ready for me to go also things once
they've<00:03:40.490> been<00:03:40.610> cooked<00:03:40.880> tend<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.270> keep<00:03:41.420> a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
they've been cooked tend to keep a

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.360 
they've been cooked tend to keep a
little<00:03:41.810> longer<00:03:42.050> in<00:03:42.290> your<00:03:42.410> fridge<00:03:42.650> too<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.280> if

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
little longer in your fridge too so if

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.010 
little longer in your fridge too so if
you're<00:03:43.550> looking<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:44.060> kind<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.300> make<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:44.810> last

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
you're looking to kind of make this last

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.930 
you're looking to kind of make this last
for<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> couple<00:03:45.470> weeks<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:46.460> safer<00:03:46.820> if

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
for a couple weeks the little safer if

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.900 
for a couple weeks the little safer if
you've<00:03:47.060> cooked<00:03:47.300> it<00:03:47.420> all<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.890> i<00:03:49.430> think<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
you've cooked it all and i think the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.670 
you've cooked it all and i think the
cheese<00:03:50.210> is<00:03:50.420> pretty<00:03:50.660> well<00:03:50.810> incorporated<00:03:51.470> with

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
cheese is pretty well incorporated with

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.160 
cheese is pretty well incorporated with
the<00:03:51.770> rest<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.130> mixture<00:03:52.310> now<00:03:52.760> i<00:03:53.660> would<00:03:53.960> say

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the rest of the mixture now i would say

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.960 
the rest of the mixture now i would say
that<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.560> would<00:03:54.800> want<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.130> let<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.400> cook<00:03:55.700> for

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
that you would want to let it cook for

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.240 
that you would want to let it cook for
about<00:03:56.060> 10<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.450> 15<00:03:56.660> minutes<00:03:56.930> uncovered<00:03:57.530> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
about 10 to 15 minutes uncovered and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.340 
about 10 to 15 minutes uncovered and
what<00:03:58.460> that'll<00:03:58.640> do<00:03:58.880> two<00:03:59.300> things<00:03:59.540> one<00:03:59.930> is<00:03:59.960> all

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
what that'll do two things one is all

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.420 
what that'll do two things one is all
the<00:04:00.470> ingredients<00:04:00.560> will<00:04:00.980> start<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.280> come

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
the ingredients will start to come

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.700 
the ingredients will start to come
together<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.510> other<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.380> little

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
together and the other is that a little

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.260 
together and the other is that a little
bit<00:04:03.770> of<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.950> water<00:04:04.160> will<00:04:04.370> evaporate<00:04:04.400> as<00:04:05.060> well

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
bit of the water will evaporate as well

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.600 
bit of the water will evaporate as well
so<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:06.410> has<00:04:06.530> been<00:04:06.650> cooking<00:04:06.860> for<00:04:07.070> about<00:04:07.250> 10<00:04:07.580> to

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
so this has been cooking for about 10 to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.070 
so this has been cooking for about 10 to
15<00:04:07.760> minutes<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.450> you'll<00:04:08.540> see<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:09.020> a

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
15 minutes and you'll see that it's a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.840 
15 minutes and you'll see that it's a
little<00:04:09.320> thicker<00:04:09.590> now<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.430> will<00:04:10.459> continue

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
little thicker now and it will continue

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.760 
little thicker now and it will continue
to<00:04:11.090> thicken<00:04:11.270> if<00:04:11.990> you<00:04:12.170> put<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> fridge

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
to thicken if you put it in the fridge

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.440 
to thicken if you put it in the fridge
for<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:13.040> couple<00:04:13.070> days<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.430> eat<00:04:13.970> leftovers

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
for a couple days and eat leftovers

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.060 
for a couple days and eat leftovers
later<00:04:14.600> on<00:04:14.810> it'll<00:04:15.020> be<00:04:15.080> thicker<00:04:15.440> than<00:04:15.650> as<00:04:15.860> well

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
later on it'll be thicker than as well

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.460 
later on it'll be thicker than as well
now<00:04:16.970> let's<00:04:17.209> say<00:04:17.330> so<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.870> right<00:04:18.080> now<00:04:18.260> is<00:04:18.440> like

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
now let's say so this right now is like

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.349 
now let's say so this right now is like
consistency<00:04:18.950> almost<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.790> soup<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.299> you

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
consistency almost of a soup so you

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.140 
consistency almost of a soup so you
could<00:04:20.570> even<00:04:20.690> just<00:04:20.960> break<00:04:21.410> some<00:04:21.650> tortillas

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
could even just break some tortillas

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.990 
could even just break some tortillas
here<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.750> make<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.139> a<00:04:23.199> tortilla<00:04:23.500> soup<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:24.820> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
here and make it a tortilla soup if you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.719 
here and make it a tortilla soup if you
wanted<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.449> for<00:04:25.600> example<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.169> be<00:04:26.259> thicker<00:04:26.729> what

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
wanted it for example to be thicker what

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.820 
wanted it for example to be thicker what
you<00:04:27.820> could<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.330> not<00:04:28.750> add<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.290> second<00:04:29.650> can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
you could do is not add that second can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.620 
you could do is not add that second can
of<00:04:29.860> tomatoes<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.370> added<00:04:30.639> or<00:04:30.789> add<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.509> of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
of tomatoes we added or add the can of

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.060 
of tomatoes we added or add the can of
tomatoes<00:04:31.960> but<00:04:32.139> don't<00:04:32.350> rinse<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.710> out<00:04:32.770> with<00:04:32.979> the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
tomatoes but don't rinse it out with the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.529 
tomatoes but don't rinse it out with the
water<00:04:33.280> so<00:04:33.550> there'll<00:04:33.699> be<00:04:33.729> less<00:04:34.000> water<00:04:34.270> that

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
water so there'll be less water that

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.659 
water so there'll be less water that
you're<00:04:34.660> adding<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.169> dish<00:04:35.490> this<00:04:36.490> as<00:04:36.639> you

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
you're adding to the dish this as you

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.370 
you're adding to the dish this as you
can<00:04:36.880> see<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> finished<00:04:37.570> dish<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> serve

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
can see is a finished dish and I serve

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.990 
can see is a finished dish and I serve
it<00:04:38.560> with<00:04:38.650> some<00:04:38.710> chips<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.340> can<00:04:39.370> also<00:04:39.639> put<00:04:39.910> it

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
it with some chips you can also put it

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240 
it with some chips you can also put it
on<00:04:40.120> pasta<00:04:40.600> or<00:04:40.810> baked<00:04:40.990> potatoes<00:04:41.530> or<00:04:41.919> their
