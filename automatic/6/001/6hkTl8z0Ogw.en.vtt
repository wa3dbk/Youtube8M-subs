00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and for people it's Friday, July 19, 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 2013 I'm still sick but for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.350
 some reason this show has to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.580
 continue then let's start with 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.380
 the stories of today that we have 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.639
 quite some very good stories and we are going to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.929
 start with the first three that the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 I have on my website 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 then they want to check is in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 the links below and the first story is 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.590
 the new trailer for the fourth season 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.510
 of the walking dead this season it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 premieres on October 13 hugs him with 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 mother is a pretty long thriller what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 They took out in comic-con and lasts 4 minutes and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.019
 medium then you want to get more or 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.519
 unless you are going to try this new 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.990
 this season the link for that in the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.189
 part of below and people the second 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 story of another trailer of a movie 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.700
 that at first I did not feel enough 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.020
 sure but this is slowly 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 changing and this movie is me 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.320
 winning and this new trailer confirms it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.059
 it's from the movie kick-ass 2 there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.469
 enough action enough deaths 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.789
 enough bullets all that 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 you probably like it is in this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.910
 movie then and also this center 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.320
 the ior and the third story about 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 a new clip that came out of the movie 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.039
 enders game that if I'm a fan I think of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.539
 This movie does not matter to me as you want 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 know with mother and she explains more to you 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.260
 little bit about the history of master 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.520
 rackham that I'm probably 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 pronouncing his name wrong is not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000
 basically a very important general in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 this whole book in this whole series and the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.940
 it's true or if you have not been moved by 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.800
 this movie probably watching 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.690
 this balance you are going to make people happen to 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.460
 other things I came across this story in 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.650
 brazil that apparently printed several 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 notes saying q has been washed or 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.580
 translated already well in Spanish praised be 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.260
 goku then if there are several of these 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 banknotes in circulation that apparently 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.020
 they are real and now the government is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.520
 angry and he wants to recover them then 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 If you are in Brazil or are going to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.940
 Brazil and you run into our tickets 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.650
 probably keep it is a very good 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.090
 collection article interpreter the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 next year they will do a crossover 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.300
 between the simpson and family guy that this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 means that they will appear in the same 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.150
 caricature and they will meet and this is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 It has become quite popular and the truth 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.390
 I'm not sure how to feel but if 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 you're going to see these two cartoons together 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.150
 probably in some episode in the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.770
 future and people had everything that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.510
 it really mattered to me today 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.740
