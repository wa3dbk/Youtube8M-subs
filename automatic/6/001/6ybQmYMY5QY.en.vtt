00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.119
 we are on a targa 27 g / t which is so 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.199
 a world first that we have 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 developed in collaboration with the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.760
 shipyard marine vote and on which we 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.230
 have grafted an American platform 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 branded with two engines 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 out for the first time in the world 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.800
 it gives that gives a lot of things that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 give a sportier boat but that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.040
 gives mostly a boat with two 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 engines for the price of an inboard engine 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 about it plays a few thousand 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 euros but it's very close and so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.879
 after the advantages the disadvantages 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 a bordered rim at least that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.670
 allows my clientele to make a real 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.329
 choice on a ball engine on board 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.550
 or on a mono inboard this boat 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.789
 the program is like with a hymn 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.699
 board it's offshore programs cd 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.289
 program we can live aboard with it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.879
 there is a double bed and a bunk for 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.440
 two children so that can be a 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.009
 boat of families of young people of families 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.960
 with young children 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.100
 it can be a program 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.940
 we personalize enormously the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.310
 boats so that can be a problem 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.780
 also fishing where we can equip the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.400
 boat with livewell from trunk to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.930
 fish so in fact we adapt the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.940
 boat is overall a lot 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.080
 of use on a hull of 8 meters 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.119
 We can do a lot of 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.310
 programs actually we got started the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.650
 different transmission concept but one 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.780
 also wanted to refresh it a bit so 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.740
 we have a design and the boat a little bit 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 more 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 in the air with railings 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.090
 tilted that was not before we 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.619
 reworked the portholes we worked 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.540
 an entire interior too much more 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.210
 modern with seats li ning post 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.299
 so we can be sitting or standing choice 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.979
 fabrics the hull color we have 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.299
 betrayed not bad the design also for 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.470
 show customers the possibilities 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.170
 of a targa actually in the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.970
 customization of a boat and often 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.960
 we have targa in a production idea 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.149
 are never the same 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.860
 they have the same same heads even size 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.610
 but inside it will be arranged differently 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 or one of the different colors
