so<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.209> I'm

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so I'm going to take that out and I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.130 
so I'm going to take that out and I'm
going<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.050> place<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.740> towards<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.490> front<00:02:14.880> of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
going to place it towards the front of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.380 
going to place it towards the front of
the<00:02:16.140> container<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.790> you'll<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.209> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the container like so so you'll see that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.260 
the container like so so you'll see that
we're<00:02:21.569> starting<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.230> build<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:23.060> where<00:02:24.060> we're

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
we're starting to build up where we're

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.650 
we're starting to build up where we're
going<00:02:24.630> from<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.470> top<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.330> highest

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
going from the top or the highest

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.870 
going from the top or the highest
feature<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> middle<00:02:28.860> feature<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.430> then

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
feature to the middle feature and then

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.059 
feature to the middle feature and then
we're<00:02:30.120> starting<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.660> cascade<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.440> droop<00:02:31.739> over

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
we're starting to cascade and droop over

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.309 
we're starting to cascade and droop over
that<00:02:32.250> way<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> add<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> little

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that way so I'm going to add a little

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.170 
that way so I'm going to add a little
bit<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.709> color<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> few<00:02:36.120> more

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
bit more color to it with a few more

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.970 
bit more color to it with a few more
begonias<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:42.350> I'm<00:02:43.350> also<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
begonias and I'm also going to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.759 
begonias and I'm also going to
incorporate<00:02:44.730> some<00:02:44.970> ivy<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.590> me<00:02:46.739> that

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
incorporate some ivy because to me that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.890 
incorporate some ivy because to me that
the<00:02:47.340> nicest<00:02:47.760> look<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.660> either

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the nicest look that you can get either

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.949 
the nicest look that you can get either
in<00:02:49.230> shade<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.800> full<00:02:50.160> Sun<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.959> something

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
in shade or in full Sun is something

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.809 
in shade or in full Sun is something
that<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.260> cascading<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.280> ivy<00:02:53.610> will

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
that is cascading in the ivy will

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.640 
that is cascading in the ivy will
certainly<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.450> well<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.470> very

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
certainly do well and it's a very

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.650 
certainly do well and it's a very
flexible<00:02:55.890> kind<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.580> plant<00:02:56.850> where<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.209> will<00:02:57.480> do

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
flexible kind of plant where it will do

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.979 
flexible kind of plant where it will do
well<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.519> deep<00:02:59.519> shade<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.269> will<00:03:00.420> also<00:03:00.630> do

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
well in deep shade but it will also do

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.309 
well in deep shade but it will also do
well<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.470> sunny<00:03:01.739> location<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.200> can

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
well in a sunny location so as you can

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.770 
well in a sunny location so as you can
see<00:03:04.380> we're<00:03:04.860> starting<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:06.060> fill<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
see we're starting to to fill it up and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.540 
see we're starting to to fill it up and
I'm<00:03:06.840> going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.170> incorporate<00:03:07.500> some<00:03:08.010> tuberous

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
I'm going to incorporate some tuberous

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.920 
I'm going to incorporate some tuberous
begonias<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.420> well

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
begonias as well

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.770 
begonias as well
the<00:03:10.319> tuberous<00:03:10.769> begonias<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.640> have<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.060> very

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the tuberous begonias can have a very

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.470 
the tuberous begonias can have a very
distinct<00:03:13.410> leaf<00:03:13.680> color<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.880> only<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.360> you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
distinct leaf color so not only are you

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360 
distinct leaf color so not only are you
creating<00:03:16.049> color<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.680> flower<00:03:16.980> but

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
creating color with the flower but

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.039 
creating color with the flower but
you're<00:03:17.519> also<00:03:17.700> sort<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.269> creating<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.810> color

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
you're also sort of creating a color

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:30.500 
you're also sort of creating a color
accent<00:03:19.650> with<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> leaf<00:03:21.360> itself

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.479 

so<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.500> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.830> thing<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.129> realize

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
so this is the kind of thing I realize

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.949 
so this is the kind of thing I realize
that<00:03:32.670> people<00:03:32.819> will<00:03:33.120> say<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.330> me<00:03:33.510> well<00:03:33.780> you're

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
that people will say to me well you're

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.899 
that people will say to me well you're
you<00:03:34.170> know<00:03:34.260> you're<00:03:34.680> planting<00:03:35.159> awfully<00:03:35.670> tight

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
you know you're planting awfully tight

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.210 
you know you're planting awfully tight
together<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.659> a<00:03:37.230> container<00:03:37.709> what<00:03:38.040> you're

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
together in a container what you're

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.740 
together in a container what you're
trying<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.849> is<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.120> trying<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.480> get

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
trying to do is you're trying to get

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.710 
trying to do is you're trying to get
that<00:03:40.019> overall<00:03:40.680> effect<00:03:41.640> almost<00:03:41.940> immediately

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that overall effect almost immediately

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.630 
that overall effect almost immediately
it's<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.530> where<00:03:43.739> you're<00:03:43.860> planting<00:03:44.370> far

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
it's not where you're planting far

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.039 
it's not where you're planting far
enough<00:03:44.879> apart<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.959> be

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
enough apart that you're going to be

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.039 
enough apart that you're going to be
waiting<00:03:46.319> for<00:03:46.560> things<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.069> fill<00:03:47.430> in<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.900> are

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
waiting for things to fill in you are

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.259 
waiting for things to fill in you are
looking<00:03:49.440> for<00:03:49.650> an<00:03:49.739> instant<00:03:50.280> garden<00:03:50.700> kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.150> an

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
looking for an instant garden kind of an

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.330 
looking for an instant garden kind of an
effect<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:51.900> when<00:03:52.620> you're<00:03:52.739> planting<00:03:53.010> this

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
effect and when you're planting this

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.369 
effect and when you're planting this
close<00:03:53.549> together<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.780> kind<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.170> look

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
close together that is the kind of look

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.229 
close together that is the kind of look
that<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:56.280> you're<00:03:56.489> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.790> be<00:03:56.910> able<00:03:57.000> to

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
that that you're going to be able to

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.050 
that that you're going to be able to
achieve<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:58.160> again<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.519> something<00:03:59.730> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
achieve and again this is something that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.850 
achieve and again this is something that
I<00:04:00.090> think<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.629> needs<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.049> go<00:04:01.230> into<00:04:01.409> an<00:04:01.620> area

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
I think really needs to go into an area

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.050 
I think really needs to go into an area
that<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.879> either<00:04:03.230> dappled<00:04:04.230> light<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:05.340> fairly

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
that is either dappled light or a fairly

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.300 
that is either dappled light or a fairly
heavy<00:04:06.329> shade<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:07.079> order<00:04:07.410> for<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.799> do<00:04:08.040> well

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
heavy shade in order for it to do well

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.670 
heavy shade in order for it to do well
otherwise<00:04:09.090> you'll<00:04:09.450> find<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.959> things<00:04:10.500> like

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
otherwise you'll find that things like

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.359 
otherwise you'll find that things like
the<00:04:10.859> caladium<00:04:11.430> leaves<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:12.090> burn
