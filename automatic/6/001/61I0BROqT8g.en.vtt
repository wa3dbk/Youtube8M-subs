00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.860 
cast chemistry too and I'm really glad
to<00:02:18.459> win<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.760> something<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.209> chemistry<00:02:19.659> for<00:02:19.810> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
to win it something for chemistry for a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.089 
to win it something for chemistry for a
change<00:02:20.079> because<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.349> didn't<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.799> well<00:02:21.040> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
change because I didn't do that well in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.079 
change because I didn't do that well in
chemistry<00:02:21.670> school<00:02:21.939> so<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.540> means<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.930> lot
