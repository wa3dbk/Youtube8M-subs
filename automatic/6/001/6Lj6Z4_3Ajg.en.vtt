00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello I'm simon make your muscle 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.549
 this video is about the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 best possible successes in muscle building there 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.269
 if you ask ten people what is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.800
 the best training to build muscle 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.390
 I guarantee you will want 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.490
 about ten different opinions 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.259
 Listen to ten different training systems 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 get explained in the best case and 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.099
 everyone will be convinced that is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.199
 just right to build muscle 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
 this is exactly how the background has to do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.900
 It's just that everyone's his 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.240
 Everyone has their own experiences 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.070
 trainer has his own system somewhere 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.570
 and other experiences 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.340
 maybe even with your own 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.990
 has gained experience and the view 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 is that supposed to work with any 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.660
 would have to be quite as simple as that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.580
 not so what works for me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 may be with someone else 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.450
 not work very simple thing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.740
 So if man and a woman are just that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 to do the same training program 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.530
 assumed even with the same weights 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.150
 would do a bit of exercise 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 Unrealistic is when the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.090
 nevertheless different successes 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.740
 It is quite easy to get by 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.510
 justifies that men and women others 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.860
 have hormonal basis that is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.390
 All in all a man needs himself 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.730
 not so much bother and will be 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 get good results in muscle building 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.880
 a woman who has to do a lot more 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.230
 and hate, for example , the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 regeneration again such a saint 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.490
 grail exactly something cardio training is concerned 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 So I 'll do it myself again 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.790
 I do not experience that much 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.409
 cardio has to do that to me 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.880
 Not so good as it does so extremely 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.560
 to do a lot of cardio training 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.760
 once a week to simply heart 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.620
 circulation system a bit too 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.790
 strengthen and sarah this 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.530
 to cheat after each one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.420
 she is still on the training session 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.600
 treadmill or on the stepper or one 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 rowing machine every time something different and 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.030
 Actually, you can already see that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.200
 which makes these huge differences 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.300
 between men and women 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.729
 and just as, of course, depends on age 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.750
 and body types dependent I know 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.310
 that of course there are people again 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.960
 the hey can not give 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.420
 be hard there is nothing to go often 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.580
 there is not such a thing in fact of me 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.659
 everything is not outdated 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.640
 and so on 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.409
 but let's be honest who with two 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.060
 healthy eyes goes through the world 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.890
 find a person of the big one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.170
 another is small of a dick of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.150
 another is the one muscular the other 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 rather lean so we are just like that 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.420
 different and even if i am with 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.249
 My brother and my brother are watching 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.959
 me we are different and too 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.730
 we also jump up differently 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.989
 all these trainings are the subject 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.560
 it is very interesting that one 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.120
 also 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 exactly at the points must say the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.599
 human being as an individual stands in the middle 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.310
 and the training system the whole 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.640
 training must be adapted to the person 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.349
 his 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.130
 that does not help the other way 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.810
 go and say I have and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 training system and the piece I now 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.900
 The people will not be over the whole 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.790
 With success I can ever give you 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.050
 guarantee so now you want to determined 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.010
 I'll stop you guys like that 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.200
 can give any case 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.700
 So I feel very comfortable in myself 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 repeat case of about 8 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.069
 repeats 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.959
 I'm definitely capable of that too 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.459
 just before muscle fail to go so 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.230
 to train really hard 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.760
 I drop my hand only when 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.560
 I want to pay attention to repeated number 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.390
 but I'm actually ready 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.769
 to push and repeat afterward 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.600
 with the next sentence simply a bigger one 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.799
 gain weight when I notice the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.299
 corresponding trade was not now 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.860
 big enough I would have repeated 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.450
 number eight already be fixed and all 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.260
 have to be at the next time one 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.880
 bigger trade 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.080
 I also want to improve somewhere 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.180
 there we are already with the keyword 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.340
 progression is a very good thing 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.799
 progression works 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.599
 conditionally to the given point there must 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.950
 you then think about something else and 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.690
 exactly for this point I have 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.739
 So a solution was found for me 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.209
 it's not just about it 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.489
 to take as large weights as possible 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.829
 on the contrary, many exercises where you small 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.890
 weights take example triceps back 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.940
 on the cable train even better example 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.859
 kickbacks because you just have little ones 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.690
 weights an intense one already needs 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.160
 and achieved with a small weight with a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.810
 Tiny little trade that really 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.359
 Nobody impressed the really big one 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.780
 Success for building muscle really good 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.340
 games 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.019
 that's really the crux of the matter 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.980
 the whole one has to be like that too 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.450
 a little bit loose that 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640
 some time said progression 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 brings the muscle and mass building 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.430
 Of course, the thing is so but the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 ends somewhere that also has its 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.120
 side effects or risks if 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.739
 you are also honest for the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.930
 We just have to think about joints 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.280
 I'm currently doing sport for eleven years 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.780
 come now in the twelfth year 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.370
 Of course, people think differently too 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.840
 maybe with 18 or 19 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.489
 Of course, I am also thinking of that now 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.170
 meanwhile, I think my joints 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.510
 of course, what I week for 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.829
 week my body does it and somewhere 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.269
 I say, too, I am on the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.100
 otherwise I would just go away 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.540
 problems and I do not have who 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.220
 doing sport for so long and never before 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 to really accept the sport injury 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.700
 The power has many things right already 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.169
 your soccer player at my age 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.970
 they all already have some 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.010
 operation behind him any 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.820
 cruciate ligaments other injury and so on 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.409
 on and on 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.300
 So that the weight training but one 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.460
 right safe sport in pretty 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.010
 easy sport and also joint already 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.970
 to 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.920
 if you like it if you want it 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.260
 does it right and I hottentotten hockey 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.700
 there goes through the training and hand the 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.140
 topic still can not handle 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.000
 Repeats do it though 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.530
 makes no sense or whole 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 Although it does in the repetition 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.160
 exercise or in the system also no 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.830
 So it makes sense synonymous with the range 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.480
 of motion at the radius of motion I have 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.580
 Of course, my very own view 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.500
 Many people say give as big as possible 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.690
 radius of movement i'll tell you quite openly 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.640
 and honest from the device and not 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.500
 necessarily only from the range of motion 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.240
 somehow someday somehow 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.900
 has defined but looks this 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.850
 device 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.590
 look at your joints to the case with 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.600
 be involved and makes it so 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.070
 couple of things depending so that was the one 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.960
 first part in the area of ​​natural gems 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.700
 I'll get in the next part still 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.380
 So give some concrete tips but 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.420
 I think only so freestyle moderately 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.020
 was one or the other there will be 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.820
 me a little bit more 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.680
 sort and the whole thing too 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.090
 maybe a bit structured 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.780
 everything is clear we'll see you in the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.310
 next video 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.310
 many greetings was simon
