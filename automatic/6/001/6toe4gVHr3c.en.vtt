of the map packs probably this is a

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.420 
of the map packs probably this is a
medium-sized<00:00:30.099> map<00:00:31.800> probably<00:00:32.800> larger<00:00:33.280> than

medium-sized map probably larger than

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.700 
medium-sized map probably larger than
trailer<00:00:33.880> park<00:00:34.150> but<00:00:34.480> take<00:00:35.170> them<00:00:35.290> down<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.650> bit

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
trailer park but take them down a bit

smaller than fuel and all all around
this<00:00:41.050> map<00:00:41.260> there<00:00:41.530> are<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> bunch<00:00:41.860> of

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
a good sniper spot probably in the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.420 
a good sniper spot probably in the

beginning of when people play the maps
but<00:01:06.730> eventually<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.450> will<00:01:07.510> get<00:01:07.690> well<00:01:07.870> known

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
but eventually it will get well known

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.370 
but eventually it will get well known
and<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:09.220> will<00:01:09.400> not<00:01:09.640> turn<00:01:10.030> out<00:01:10.180> good<00:01:10.840> for<00:01:11.050> you

on to the next part of the map this is a
more<00:02:02.720> close<00:02:03.110> range<00:02:03.440> area<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.100> map<00:02:04.250> we've

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
more close range area of the map we've

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.050 
more close range area of the map we've

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
food court is kind of like trailer park

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.470 
food court is kind of like trailer park
it's<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.860> straight<00:02:16.760> forward<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.270> there's<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
it's just straight forward and there's a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's just straight forward and there's a
lot<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.630> corners<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.780> corner<00:02:21.230> there<00:02:21.550> and

lot of corners that corner there and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
the funhouse is probably the feature

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.650 
the funhouse is probably the feature
that<00:02:30.640> people<00:02:31.640> are<00:02:31.760> most<00:02:31.940> interested<00:02:32.180> in

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that people are most interested in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.810 
that people are most interested in
because<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> most<00:02:33.440> talked<00:02:33.680> about

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.210 

there's<00:02:37.820> more<00:02:38.480> inside<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.410> funhouse<00:02:39.620> than<00:02:40.100> it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
there's more inside the funhouse than it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.420 
there's more inside the funhouse than it
looks<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.640> there's<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.510> lot<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:42.250> things<00:02:43.250> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
looks like there's a lot of things to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.180 
looks like there's a lot of things to
hide<00:02:43.580> behind<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.209> lot<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> walls<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:46.160> can

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
hide behind a lot of walls and you can

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.810 
hide behind a lot of walls and you can
actually<00:02:46.310> go<00:02:46.700> upstairs<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:48.550> once<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.670> head

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
good cover and some height you should

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.060 
good cover and some height you should
use<00:03:25.270> that<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.600> your<00:03:25.720> advantage<00:03:26.070> most

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
sides of the map and heading down to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.920 
sides of the map and heading down to
this<00:03:36.530> building<00:03:36.950> come<00:03:37.700> out<00:03:37.820> another<00:03:38.720> one<00:03:38.900> of

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
this building come out another one of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.230 
this building come out another one of
the<00:03:39.020> clowns<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.530> will<00:03:39.680> probably<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:40.070> the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
the clowns this will probably be the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.110 
the clowns this will probably be the
more<00:03:41.530> frequently<00:03:42.530> used<00:03:42.800> one<00:03:43.070> as<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:45.230> other

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
more frequently used one as the other

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.270 
more frequently used one as the other
pathways<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:48.200> other<00:03:48.320> paddlers<00:03:48.590> away<00:03:48.950> from<00:03:49.160> it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
pathways the other paddlers away from it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.760 
pathways the other paddlers away from it
are<00:03:49.370> farther<00:03:49.820> away<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.930> will<00:03:51.260> definitely

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
are farther away so it will definitely

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.180 
are farther away so it will definitely
be<00:03:51.950> harder<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.340> tell<00:03:52.870> if<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.650> person<00:03:55.070> or

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
be harder to tell if that is a person or

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.280 
be harder to tell if that is a person or

another close quarters area pretty good
for<00:04:25.440> shotguns<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.410> there<00:04:28.560> are<00:04:28.680> buildings<00:04:28.950> and

doorways on either side so you must be

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.610 
doorways on either side so you must be
careful<00:04:32.460> about<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:33.000> one<00:04:36.200> under<00:04:37.200> this<00:04:37.290> little
