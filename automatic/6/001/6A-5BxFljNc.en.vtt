this up but I'm gonna go ahead and drill

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
this up but I'm gonna go ahead and drill

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
gonna put them well big enough holy
earth<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> fit<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> magnet<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:58.699> probably<00:00:59.699> some

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
earth to fit a magnet and probably some

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.130 
earth to fit a magnet and probably some
of<00:00:59.969> her<00:01:00.059> fighting<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> heck<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:00.930> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of her fighting what the heck are you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.459 
of her fighting what the heck are you
doing

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
doing

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
doing
that's<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.920> expensive<00:01:02.370> figure<00:01:02.969> why<00:01:03.210> you're

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that's an expensive figure why you're

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.810 
that's an expensive figure why you're
drilling<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.899> hole<00:01:03.930> there

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
drilling a hole there

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.359 
drilling a hole there
well<00:01:06.439> I'm<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:08.130> improving<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
well I'm just improving it because you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.359 
well I'm just improving it because you
know<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> my<00:01:13.439> missiles<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.039 

mean<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.520> hoping<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> won't<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
mean I'm hoping that it won't look you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
mean I'm hoping that it won't look you
know<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> bad<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.270> we'll<00:01:21.900> see

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
know as bad as it would be but we'll see

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.359 
know as bad as it would be but we'll see
how<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> turns<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> I'm<00:01:24.119> drilling<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:25.369> big

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
how it turns out so I'm drilling a big

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
how it turns out so I'm drilling a big
enough<00:01:26.640> hole

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
enough hole

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.890 
enough hole
I<00:01:27.799> probably<00:01:28.799> gonna<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> off<00:01:29.310> camera<00:01:29.900> but

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I probably gonna do it off camera but

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.120 
I probably gonna do it off camera but
that<00:01:31.140> needs<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.130> deeper<00:01:32.900> alright<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.020> back

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
that needs to be deeper alright I'm back

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
that needs to be deeper alright I'm back
and<00:01:35.130> you'll<00:01:35.460> notice<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> there's<00:01:36.390> four

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and you'll notice that there's four

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
and you'll notice that there's four
shiny<00:01:37.140> things<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> middle<00:01:38.210> there<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
shiny things in the middle there are the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.340 
shiny things in the middle there are the
1.5<00:01:39.900> millimeter<00:01:40.229> by<00:01:40.409> 3<00:01:40.650> millimeter<00:01:41.159> magnets

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
1.5 millimeter by 3 millimeter magnets

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.819 
1.5 millimeter by 3 millimeter magnets
which<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.799> always<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:45.140> stock<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.470> it's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
which I always have a stock of them it's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.840 
which I always have a stock of them it's
very<00:01:47.189> helpful<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.780> or<00:01:48.780> modding<00:01:49.290> things<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
very helpful to or modding things so I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
very helpful to or modding things so I
drilled<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.350> day<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> missed<00:01:52.860> 1.5

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
drilled that the day I missed 1.5

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240 
drilled that the day I missed 1.5
millimeters<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> used<00:01:54.750> my<00:01:55.250> micro

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
millimeters so I just used my micro

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450 
millimeters so I just used my micro
drill<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.950> go

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
drill and there we go

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
drill and there we go
next<00:02:00.119> thing<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.329> very<00:02:01.020> much<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> missile

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
next thing is very much the missile

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.670 
next thing is very much the missile
heads<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> got<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.899> MSG<00:02:04.939> spiked<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:07.110> got

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
heads so I got this the MSG spiked I got

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
heads so I got this the MSG spiked I got
this<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.920> hlj<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.879> pretty<00:02:09.119> much<00:02:09.179> just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this from hlj and I'm pretty much just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.530 
this from hlj and I'm pretty much just
the<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> middle<00:02:10.050> which<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.550> 7.0<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:12.180> 7

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the one in the middle which is 7.0 or 7

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.480 
the one in the middle which is 7.0 or 7
millimeters

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
millimeters

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030 
millimeters
sadly<00:02:14.490> enough<00:02:14.819> if<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.780> love<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
sadly enough if you love this this is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.880 
sadly enough if you love this this is
short<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.819> taller<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:19.290> same<00:02:19.530> way<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
short that's taller the same way in the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.050 
short that's taller the same way in the
middle<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.090> slightly<00:02:21.840> uneven<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
middle so it's slightly uneven and to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.350 
middle so it's slightly uneven and to
show<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.350> put<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.680> on

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
there's magnets there and nice thing

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.720 
there's magnets there and nice thing
about<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.830> gotta<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.190> release<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
about this is you gotta just release it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
about this is you gotta just release it
and<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.780> correct<00:02:34.170> itself<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:35.160> would

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and it kind of correct itself it would

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.260 
and it kind of correct itself it would
go<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.580> there<00:02:37.310> yep<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.820> we<00:02:38.910> go

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
go in there yep there we go

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.140 
go in there yep there we go
but<00:02:40.110> yeah<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.709> got<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.040> unevenness<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
but yeah you got that unevenness and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
but yeah you got that unevenness and
it's<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.080> sharp<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:44.010> think<00:02:44.400> I'm

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it's really sharp so I think I'm

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.850 
it's really sharp so I think I'm
actually<00:02:44.880> sending<00:02:45.209> down<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.600> top<00:02:45.780> part<00:02:46.080> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
actually sending down the top part to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.190 
actually sending down the top part to
bounce<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> bottom<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:48.050> actually<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.110> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
bounce at the bottom but actually if you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.840 
bounce at the bottom but actually if you
think<00:02:49.230> about<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:49.950> seems<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
think about it you know seems like it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.660 
think about it you know seems like it's
launching<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> top<00:02:51.720> one<00:02:51.989> first<00:02:52.400> before<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
launching the top one first before the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.570 
launching the top one first before the
bottom<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.709> I'll<00:02:55.709> probably<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.400> leave

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
bottom one so I'll probably just leave

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.020 
bottom one so I'll probably just leave
it<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.680> does<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.430> job<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.880> I'm

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
