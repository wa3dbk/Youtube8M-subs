it<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.730> boss<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.540> time<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:59.080> one-piece<00:00:59.530> bars

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
it the boss this time a one-piece bars

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.730 
it the boss this time a one-piece bars
instead<00:01:01.060> of<00:01:01.180> having<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.540> adjustable<00:01:02.530> stock

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
instead of having the adjustable stock

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.280 
instead of having the adjustable stock
bars<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.120> there<00:01:04.330> are<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> lot<00:01:04.449> stronger<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.050> ride

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
bars so there are a lot stronger to ride

bars so there are a lot stronger to ride
a<00:01:05.650> lot<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.310> people<00:01:06.520> don't<00:01:06.670> like<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.970> grips<00:01:07.180> but

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
a lot of people don't like the grips but

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.610 
a lot of people don't like the grips but
I<00:01:07.600> don't<00:01:07.780> really<00:01:07.900> have<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> problem<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.440> them

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
I don't really have a problem with them

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.000 
I don't really have a problem with them
except<00:01:09.660> then<00:01:10.660> I<00:01:10.690> did<00:01:11.110> for<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.350> few<00:01:11.560> weeks<00:01:11.680> until

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
except then I did for a few weeks until

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.250 
except then I did for a few weeks until
they<00:01:12.370> split<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:15.010> eventually<00:01:15.990> though<00:01:16.990> just

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
they split so eventually though just

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.030 
they split so eventually though just
wear<00:01:17.920> out<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.280> you'll<00:01:18.369> have<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.610> replace<00:01:18.880> them

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
wear out and you'll have to replace them

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.469 
wear out and you'll have to replace them
the<00:01:21.040> fork<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.520> same<00:01:21.729> as<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.030> razor<00:01:22.210> Pro

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
the fork is the same as the razor Pro

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.380 
the fork is the same as the razor Pro
Fork<00:01:22.810> but<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.410> has<00:01:23.530> gussets<00:01:24.040> on<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.400> front<00:01:25.270> and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
Fork but it has gussets on the front and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.180 
Fork but it has gussets on the front and
back<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.930> prevent<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.380> from<00:01:26.410> bending

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
back to prevent it from bending

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.570 
back to prevent it from bending
although<00:01:27.850> mine's<00:01:28.750> bent<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.110> little<00:01:29.140> bit

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
although mine's bent a little bit

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.870 
although mine's bent a little bit
unfortunately<00:01:31.500> last<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:32.710> not<00:01:32.800> least<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
unfortunately last but not least the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
unfortunately last but not least the
deck<00:01:34.150> which<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.260> one<00:01:35.950> piece<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:37.210> any<00:01:37.600> wobble

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
deck which is one piece so any wobble

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.060 
deck which is one piece so any wobble
that<00:01:38.080> you're<00:01:38.260> gonna<00:01:38.350> get<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.770> scooter

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
that you're gonna get in the scooter

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.790 
that you're gonna get in the scooter
it's<00:01:39.490> gonna<00:01:39.640> be<00:01:39.790> out<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.030> headset<00:01:42.509> it's

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it's gonna be out of the headset it's

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.969 
it's gonna be out of the headset it's
double<00:01:44.800> TIG<00:01:45.369> welded<00:01:45.789> on<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.929> top<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.289> bottom

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270 

and<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.600> deck<00:01:52.810> itself<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.470> one<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> half

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
and the deck itself is one and a half

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.240 
and the deck itself is one and a half
inches<00:01:54.820> sure<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.420> think<00:01:55.690> or<00:01:56.170> half<00:01:56.410> an<00:01:56.530> inch<00:01:56.710> I'm

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
inches sure I think or half an inch I'm

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.370 
inches sure I think or half an inch I'm
not<00:01:57.429> sure<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.880> grip<00:02:01.119> tape<00:02:01.300> rips<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:02.050> paper

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
not sure the grip tape rips like paper

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.980 
not sure the grip tape rips like paper
so<00:02:03.280> what<00:02:03.789> I've<00:02:03.910> done<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.149> replace<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.780> with<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
so what I've done is replace it with the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.720 
so what I've done is replace it with the
dog<00:02:05.229> skewers<00:02:05.619> grip<00:02:05.800> feet<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:12.190> wheels<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
dog skewers grip feet the wheels and the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.480 
dog skewers grip feet the wheels and the
breaker<00:02:12.970> exactly<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.960> same<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.530> these<00:02:15.310> are

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
breaker exactly the same so these are

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.280 
breaker exactly the same so these are
most<00:02:15.670> likely<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.150> break<00:02:16.270> first<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> school

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.290 

now<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.920> improvements<00:02:21.340> I'd<00:02:21.700> make<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
now what improvements I'd make with the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.570 
now what improvements I'd make with the
school<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> past<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.830> although<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.430> one

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
school the past the get although the one

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.750 
school the past the get although the one
piece<00:02:28.200> they<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.350> no<00:02:29.640> reinforcement<00:02:30.640> or

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
piece they have no reinforcement or

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.660 
piece they have no reinforcement or
gussets<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> replaced<00:02:34.240> mine<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:35.670> we

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
gussets so I replaced mine with we

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.449 
gussets so I replaced mine with we
skewers<00:02:37.090> one<00:02:37.270> piece<00:02:37.450> bars<00:02:37.890> they're<00:02:38.890> gussets

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
skewers one piece bars they're gussets

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.820 
skewers one piece bars they're gussets
underneath<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.209> crossbar<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.500> helps

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
underneath the crossbar so it helps

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.190 
underneath the crossbar so it helps
prevent<00:02:42.100> them<00:02:42.280> from<00:02:42.310> bending<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.580> grips<00:02:45.910> are

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
prevent them from bending the grips are

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
prevent them from bending the grips are
BMX<00:02:47.200> grips<00:02:47.530> animal<00:02:48.400> Edwin's<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:50.110> since<00:02:51.070> my

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.209 

of<00:03:28.389> how<00:03:28.599> thin<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.139> brake<00:03:29.379> is<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.919> how<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.219 
of how thin the brake is and how it

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.569 
of how thin the brake is and how it
wears<00:03:30.400> down<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:31.090> fast<00:03:31.799> I've<00:03:32.799> replaced<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.519> with

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
wears down so fast I've replaced it with

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.159 
wears down so fast I've replaced it with
a<00:03:34.150> blade<00:03:35.049> skewers<00:03:35.530> brake<00:03:36.449> which<00:03:37.449> is<00:03:37.719> a<00:03:37.870> lot

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
a blade skewers brake which is a lot

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:44.849 
a blade skewers brake which is a lot
thicker<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:39.069> lot<00:03:39.340> stronger<00:03:43.349> see<00:03:44.349> yeah<00:03:44.500> like

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
thicker and a lot stronger see yeah like

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.879 
thicker and a lot stronger see yeah like
I<00:03:44.980> said<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:46.629> scooter<00:03:46.930> itself<00:03:47.319> is<00:03:47.469> great<00:03:47.709> for

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
I said the scooter itself is great for

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.030 
I said the scooter itself is great for
beginners<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.699> if<00:03:48.969> you're<00:03:49.599> more<00:03:50.560> into<00:03:50.829> riding

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
beginners but if you're more into riding

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.220 
beginners but if you're more into riding
I'd<00:03:51.519> get<00:03:51.760> some<00:03:52.030> better<00:03:52.389> parts<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.870> some<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.169> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
I'd get some better parts of some of the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.959 
I'd get some better parts of some of the
stuff<00:03:53.439> like<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:54.010> know<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.219> brake<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.939> wheels

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
stuff like you know the brake the wheels

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.599 
stuff like you know the brake the wheels
little<00:03:55.629> things<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.829> keep<00:03:57.519> it

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
little things like that to keep it

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.069 
little things like that to keep it
lasting<00:03:57.729> a<00:03:58.030> little<00:03:58.180> bit<00:03:58.269> longer<00:03:58.449> I<00:03:58.750> mean<00:03:58.989> I

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
lasting a little bit longer I mean I

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.020 
lasting a little bit longer I mean I
don't<00:03:59.290> expect<00:03:59.769> my<00:04:00.009> deck<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.400> break<00:04:00.609> any<00:04:00.819> time

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
don't expect my deck to break any time

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.569 
don't expect my deck to break any time
soon<00:04:01.239> so<00:04:01.470> I'm<00:04:02.470> pretty<00:04:02.739> pleased<00:04:03.069> with<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.370> so

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
soon so I'm pretty pleased with it so

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.789 
soon so I'm pretty pleased with it so
far<00:04:03.849> what<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:04.750> also<00:04:05.049> say<00:04:05.229> about<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:05.530> reason

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
far what it also say about the reason

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.289 
far what it also say about the reason
watch<00:04:05.919> pro<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.639> just<00:04:06.819> looks<00:04:07.030> kind<00:04:07.209> of

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
watch pro is that it just looks kind of

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.449 
watch pro is that it just looks kind of
plain<00:04:07.509> I<00:04:07.900> mean<00:04:08.229> they<00:04:08.859> should<00:04:09.040> do<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.189> color

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
plain I mean they should do a color

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.399 
plain I mean they should do a color
option<00:04:09.819> or<00:04:09.939> something<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.959> we<00:04:11.049> had<00:04:11.169> much

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
option or something and we had much

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.140 
option or something and we had much
prefer<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.949> have<00:04:12.099> you<00:04:12.459> know<00:04:12.549> different<00:04:12.759> colors

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
prefer to have you know different colors

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:23.820 
prefer to have you know different colors
it<00:04:13.689> makes<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.930> look<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.109> bit<00:04:14.229> nicer<00:04:14.409> yes

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.370

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380
