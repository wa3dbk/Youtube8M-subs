that in this collection there are

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.149 
that in this collection there are
one-off<00:01:30.599> bikes<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.289> don't<00:01:31.349> exist<00:01:31.920> anywhere

one-off bikes that don't exist anywhere

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
one-off bikes that don't exist anywhere
else<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.789> was<00:01:32.969> lucky<00:01:33.420> enough<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.659> find<00:01:34.020> them

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
else and I was lucky enough to find them

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
else and I was lucky enough to find them
for<00:01:34.649> me<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.490> put<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.789> collection<00:01:35.999> in<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.779> barn

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
for me to put this collection in a barn

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
for me to put this collection in a barn
or<00:01:37.289> my<00:01:37.439> garage<00:01:37.670> or<00:01:38.670> even<00:01:39.149> share<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
or my garage or even share it with

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.559 
or my garage or even share it with
museums<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.880> by

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
museums which I do and I think by

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.080 
museums which I do and I think by
selling<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> collection<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:43.889> collection

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
selling the collection as a collection

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.059 
selling the collection as a collection
and<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.209> will<00:01:45.419> be<00:01:45.599> shared<00:01:45.929> by<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.709> next

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
and it will be shared by the next

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.010 
and it will be shared by the next
caretaker<00:01:47.609> and<00:01:47.999> I<00:01:48.209> think<00:01:48.539> that's<00:01:48.719> what<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
caretaker and I think that's what it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.990 
caretaker and I think that's what it
should<00:01:49.049> be

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
should be

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.150
