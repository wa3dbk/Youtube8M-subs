00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 ah the current 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.329
 aes eletropaulo 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.379
 in 2009 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.740
 how are we talking about 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 crisis 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.840
 of termination 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.169
 ef 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.320
 In a bowl 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.480
 do not leave this news away from you 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.199
 is to change your attitude 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.439
 that instead of talking about problems 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.460
 I'm going after solutions. 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.620
 instead of talking about unemployment 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.430
 gave a little more of himself 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 smile to the life 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510
 now moreover 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.520
 thought he was healthy 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 we will take care of them is key 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.010
 defenders and healthy stamping on the face showing a more 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 nice 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.540
 and we need to stay alone in the pleasant deal 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.620
 has more chance 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.199
 to be well accepted 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.410
 and behold the senses 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.989
 the eyes of the north south 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.030
 province 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 this personality if he knew better 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 the orthodontic appliance 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 eder is still very successful that we had 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.570
 in the assembly of the productive apparatus 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.430
 today our patient take 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.410
 will go through the same process 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.280
 an interior southern fault that bothers 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 small space between the two teeth 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490
 and with an orthodontic appliance 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.039
 We will solve this problem. 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.820
 I'm with the federation 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.469
 To see what you are like, this area is simple. 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.070
 What is the first step? 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.250
 of the use of the orthodontic appliance 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 It's very big 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120
 I'm in love. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 because I finished the examination of the documentation 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.250
 we can see 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.470
 if the patient is or is not another device what is its main 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.600
 problem and how we 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.689
 we will carry out the case six years without the documents is practically impossible 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.890
 to perform an orthodontic treatment 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.539
 along with the man too 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.909
 personal purse models 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.180
 to show 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 with her smile with as we can 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.110
 correct 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.700
 the personal soloists the first step is to prepare 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.549
 of the surface of the teeth 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.599
 in which you will receive 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.599
 I even speak to them the word t 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.669
 However 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 the military conditioner 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.889
 if placed 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:40.879
 even c 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.729
 on the ticket 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.669
 the audience agreed 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.669
 his mother 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 with students 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.820
 after homologation of the apparatus is passed to arcon 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.629
 that will connect an appliance or 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.629
 this act is one of those responsible for moving 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.699
 correct teeth 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.349
 today there are several types of device usage files 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.760
 there are celebrations 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.079
 the post are called to referee motivated which you the march 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.039
 back to the original position even 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.930
 if used 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.309
 in case of device termination 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.639
 in the case of starting with a little table wine in the plot of the fifth ma 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.629
 it is a human art in the region the material the hge 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.949
 very modern use 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.949
 we'll be fine later 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:23.750
 now 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.750
 she will enter a process with the deadline 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.409
 putting the device is a very important decision in the person's life 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.819
 the northern department with the process 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.860
 which often requires 5 million 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.979
 david motivation 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.509
 is a person who really wants to change to go through this process 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.029
 stay with the appliance for a period of 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.830
 have to come to the doctor's office 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.249
 month to month 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.809
 for told in the maintenance world itself 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.849
 the webs by placing puddles 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.810
 the necessary procedures to take before the successful one 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.109
 many people run for it today is called boulder 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.530
 forget that it's important you're always 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.479
 often 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.970
 used the device without 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.680
 or not to maintain 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.860
 the appliance 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.830
 It's the same thing as ending the Senate. 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.819
 one hour 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.069
 Are you going to have trouble? 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.659
 one hour to treat one side more than the other 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.909
 so that's why year-end sales 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.879
 used an appliance for personal 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:32.919
 leading 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.919
 in the seriousness that is reserve 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.849
 she 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.180
 the current 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.199
 she was 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.610
 in season 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.550
