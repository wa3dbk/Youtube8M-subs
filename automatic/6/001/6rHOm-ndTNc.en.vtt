00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.500
 I was talking another day with a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 my friend and we were comparing the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 dodge with football but does not have 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.400
 Comparation 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.480
 football has a lot of play in the link ends 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480
 0 to 0 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.930
 the rodeo is a goal every 8 seconds 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 in football you pay and watch a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.270
 You still play a show 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 serious 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 It's that story that woman does not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 like football 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 them surely love dem what is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 best 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.739
 in the rodeo there is no hat on 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 without cpi there my friend decided to talk about 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 You guys are very different. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.010
 in boxing you always fight with someone with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.400
 the same weight as your rodeo your 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.330
 that up to one tonne and what 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.220
 plays 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.370
 he does not stop fighting when he touches 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370
 Bell 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:21.590
 and then he came to surf but the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.770
 Rodeo we also have waves in the sand 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:32.180
 radical maneuvers lifesaving dives 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.180
 so that's what's missing 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.420
 the rodeo is our beach athletics two 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.020
 athletes always have an extra stimulus 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 to run 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.150
 so I said maybe 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.990
 hearts banging unparalleled cheerleading 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.810
 faith 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.950
 courage 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.960
 This is the world of the rodeo in 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.950
 most dangerous of extreme sports and 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.070
 stay tuned 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.070
 will be one emotion after another
