00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.500
 hello now I want to do 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:05.939
 a small overview of some kind of comfort point 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.490
 RU 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.260
 actually this project is dedicated to the topic 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.440
 the samp-rp project 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.130
 at this moment there will be different 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.779
 Menus that are quite useful such 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.829
 for example, as a monitor 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:26.289
 registration click here look any 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.359
 another server for example dozen open 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.869
 we see all the administrators who 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.180
 find on the tenth series online see 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.460
 doubly the fraction of this case is 1002 s 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.610
 fraction see who is online 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.829
 edge any other server for example 1 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.600
 also probably only for on here everyones 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.019
 such comrades 4 examples one indicator 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 to the group we are also raw another 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.440
 the administrator goes to another server 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.879
 for example 4 9 and it will be the same here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.899
 display the server monitoring menu 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.270
 but that's about the same as on the forum itself 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.210
 only in this case as it should now 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 especially no load so it works 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.450
 several times faster here but if you want 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.300
 find something like it is written here 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.970
 use this command here 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.000
 some one you just need a nickname also 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.119
 monitoring will start soon 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.729
 honest to you what is he like 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.159
 for example, you enter the menu so be it 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.619
 show those players you are 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.700
 write in via nick here 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.930
 for example its you real to him that is the link 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 on his 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
 screenshot of breaking his password and he 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.450
 already will be you for example 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 director fbi who will contribute 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 blacklist and then further you 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 can easily just open the link 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.049
 here will show you all 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.170
 comrades who are through his 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.950
 faction and its violation will also be 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.470
 to see what is and what if someone 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.940
 for example got back into the army you can 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.590
 to quickly fire him also 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.329
 we have such a button here download here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.630
 actually the most useful 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:24.930
 things we have here is like directly 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.680
 the game itself here it happened here you can 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.560
 watch the same game kuben yes 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.269
 poher bandicam i mean for example this one 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.130
 the program in which by the way I am now 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.209
 rented well and maps with squares can 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.890
 be later i will add something else here 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.160
 also if you have any ideas 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.130
 I will consider them with pleasure later 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.810
 I'll post it soon 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.310
 feedback here will be possible 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 send me directly 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.569
 any requests when i want to say that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
 probably in the near future may 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.340
 strong deciding implements what thing 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.100
 monitoring all players individually 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.459
 I mean the story say for example 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.100
 you can write some of them and you 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.020
 will give for example who was you in what 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.730
 fractions 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.980
 about what time they are online 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.830
 a little bit of a similarity with online laid out 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.989
 Well, then for covering up this thing as a city 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.010
 some interesting principle can it 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.709
 the near future can also be done 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.950
 will make another such search menu 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.959
 the player on these servers is such too 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.060
 This program has seen moths 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.620
 but here you do not need any 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 program download anything you just 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.450
 go to the site itself bargaining point ru and already 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.190
 you all have these menus become 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.350
 available here and some 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.959
 little things will be available 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.690
 soon as i say for example 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.140
 you need someone to find a player of some kind 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.769
 At all you will enter his nickname here's Ivan 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.250
 machine will give what their such 2 on 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.079
 which server is the game so far 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.079
 at the moment it's all
