00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
about a Mirasol displays is it truly

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.670 
about a Mirasol displays is it truly
low-power<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.600> order<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.110> fifty<00:00:53.410> percent

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
low-power it's on order of fifty percent

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.650 
low-power it's on order of fifty percent
more<00:00:53.920> than<00:00:54.129> an<00:00:54.250> average<00:00:54.489> display<00:00:55.030> technology

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
more than an average display technology

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.689 
more than an average display technology
little<00:00:56.320> known<00:00:56.469> fact<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.219> display<00:00:57.550> is

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
little known fact that the display is

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.700 
little known fact that the display is
the<00:00:57.730> number<00:00:58.239> one<00:00:58.390> power<00:00:58.629> consuming<00:00:59.260> component

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the number one power consuming component

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.310 
the number one power consuming component
and<00:00:59.829> a<00:01:00.430> device<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:01.629> if<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:01.899> could<00:01:02.020> offset

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
and a device and so if you could offset

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.500 
and a device and so if you could offset
power<00:01:02.739> by<00:01:03.010> putting<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.520> low-power<00:01:03.969> display<00:01:04.330> in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
power by putting a low-power display in

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.210 
power by putting a low-power display in
your<00:01:04.689> rockin<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.379> rollin<00:01:05.619> your<00:01:05.770> customers

your rockin and rollin your customers

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.950 
your rockin and rollin your customers
are<00:01:06.369> happy<00:01:06.490> because<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.030> device<00:01:07.299> last<00:01:07.570> longer

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
are happy because the device last longer

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.570 
are happy because the device last longer
carriers<00:01:08.590> are<00:01:08.710> making<00:01:08.950> money<00:01:09.130> because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
carriers are making money because

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.880 
carriers are making money because
they're<00:01:10.360> downloading<00:01:10.659> more<00:01:11.080> abs<00:01:11.320> everyone's

built<00:01:15.420> visibility<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.570> means<00:01:16.780> when<00:01:16.930> you

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
built visibility that means when you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.570 
built visibility that means when you
take<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.380> outside<00:01:17.500> it's<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.220> going<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.490> be

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
take it outside it's not going to be

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.920 
take it outside it's not going to be
flooded<00:01:19.000> out<00:01:19.119> by<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.360> Sun<00:01:19.630> you're<00:01:19.810> not

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
flooded out by the Sun you're not

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.899 
flooded out by the Sun you're not
fighting<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.560> Sun<00:01:20.770> you're<00:01:21.070> using<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.580> Sun

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
fighting the Sun you're using the Sun

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.570 
fighting the Sun you're using the Sun
which<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.270> very<00:01:22.780> cool<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.500> runs<00:01:23.740> video<00:01:24.100> it's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
which is very cool it runs video it's

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.170 
which is very cool it runs video it's
inherently<00:01:25.210> rapid<00:01:25.780> response<00:01:26.259> time<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:28.000> is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
inherently rapid response time and it is

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.420 
inherently rapid response time and it is
also<00:01:28.450> color<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:29.920> important

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
also color and so this is important

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.310 
also color and so this is important
ameter<00:01:31.000> technology<00:01:31.659> since<00:01:31.960> it's<00:01:32.170> been

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
ameter technology since it's been

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.749 
ameter technology since it's been
deployed<00:01:32.680> has<00:01:32.920> been<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.220> black<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.729> white

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
deployed has been a black and white

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.520 
deployed has been a black and white
experience<00:01:34.299> which<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.600> awesome<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.140> books

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
experience which is awesome for books

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.160 
experience which is awesome for books
it's<00:01:35.979> really<00:01:36.159> created<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.700> fun<00:01:36.970> category<00:01:37.240> these

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
it's really created a fun category these

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.469 
it's really created a fun category these
ereader<00:01:38.530> devices<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.549> it's<00:01:39.850> really<00:01:40.030> limited

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
ereader devices but it's really limited

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.690

content and for color and last time I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.469 
content and for color and last time I
checked<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:45.100> live<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.430> color<00:01:45.579> world<00:01:45.850> based

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
checked we live in a color world based

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.539 
checked we live in a color world based
on<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.780> concept<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.409> biomimetics<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.460> that

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
on the concept of biomimetics and that

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.270 
on the concept of biomimetics and that
basically<00:01:48.759> means<00:01:49.240> we've<00:01:49.420> mimic<00:01:49.960> nature<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
basically means we've mimic nature to

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.980 
basically means we've mimic nature to
create<00:01:51.549> our<00:01:51.790> color<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.479> we<00:01:52.630> use<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
create our color and so we use the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.300 
create our color and so we use the
ambient<00:01:53.439> light<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.710> room<00:01:53.740> that's<00:01:54.009> just

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
ambient light in the room that's just

ambient light in the room that's just
the<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.939> light<00:01:55.180> found<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.600> this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
the just the light found in this

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.420 
the just the light found in this
environment<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.500> these<00:01:56.979> little<00:01:57.250> MEMS

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
environment and these little MEMS

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.789 
environment and these little MEMS
devices<00:01:57.790> actually<00:01:58.149> modulate<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.350> light<00:01:59.530> wave

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
devices actually modulate the light wave

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.039 
devices actually modulate the light wave
which<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.159> very<00:02:00.490> cool<00:02:00.820> moves<00:02:01.540> just<00:02:01.689> like<00:02:01.780> this

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
which is very cool moves just like this

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.569 
which is very cool moves just like this
and<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.619> would<00:02:02.829> be<00:02:02.860> green<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.369> would<00:02:03.490> be

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
and so this would be green this would be

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.920 
and so this would be green this would be
read<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:03.939> would<00:02:04.119> be<00:02:04.240> whatever<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.869> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
read this would be whatever and in a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.480 
read this would be whatever and in a
closed<00:02:05.140> state<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.469> would<00:02:05.530> be<00:02:05.680> black<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.369> it's

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
closed state it would be black so it's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.430 
closed state it would be black so it's
