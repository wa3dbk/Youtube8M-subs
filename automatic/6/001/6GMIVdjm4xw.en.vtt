00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
coming together on some of the the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.320

larger whoops there there were some

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.419 
larger whoops there there were some
pretty<00:01:38.420> large<00:01:38.690> loops<00:01:39.020> out<00:01:39.200> there<00:01:39.440> today<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.979> I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.350 

a<00:01:49.119> whoop<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.740> guess<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.430> skier<00:01:51.760> what<00:01:52.330> a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
a whoop is I guess to a skier what a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.960 
a whoop is I guess to a skier what a
local<00:01:52.750> would<00:01:52.930> be<00:01:53.080> it's<00:01:53.890> when<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.549> goes<00:01:54.729> like

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
local would be it's when it goes like

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.500 
local would be it's when it goes like
that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
that

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.690 
that
your<00:01:55.780> bike<00:01:55.930> has<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.380> pump<00:01:56.590> through<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.490> really

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
your bike has to pump through the really

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.960 
your bike has to pump through the really
good<00:01:57.940> guys<00:01:57.970> fly<00:01:58.570> over<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.020> top<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.259> them<00:01:59.590> but

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.120

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.470 
very small country and that's between
two<00:02:21.260> points<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.340> long<00:02:22.580> distance<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.300> here

two points is not long distance but here
you<00:02:23.570> got<00:02:23.720> big<00:02:23.930> distances<00:02:24.470> between<00:02:24.680> them<00:02:25.930> it's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
you got big distances between them it's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.870 
you got big distances between them it's
a<00:02:26.990> lot<00:02:27.140> harder<00:02:27.410> than<00:02:27.590> navigate<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.640> used

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
a lot harder than navigate the we used

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.960 
a lot harder than navigate the we used
my<00:02:29.360> normal<00:02:29.720> day<00:02:30.020> at<00:02:30.560> work<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:31.400> sitting<00:02:31.880> in

my normal day at work I'm sitting in
front<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.420> computer<00:02:32.720> system<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.410> no

monitors fairly large monitors in front

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.750 
monitors fairly large monitors in front
of<00:02:37.820> me<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.710> small<00:02:40.250> room<00:02:40.490> with

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
of me and it's a small room with

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.090 
of me and it's a small room with

in<00:02:43.670> contrast<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.570> like<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:45.740> did<00:02:45.860> today<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
in contrast to like what I did today and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.090 
in contrast to like what I did today and
you<00:02:46.790> can't<00:02:47.030> have<00:02:47.240> much<00:02:47.960> further<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
you can't have much further out in the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.510 
you can't have much further out in the
spectrum

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
