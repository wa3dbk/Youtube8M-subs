thank you yeah so the original maintence
video<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.900> incredibly<00:02:22.900> early<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.670> callers

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
video is incredibly early and I callers

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.420 
video is incredibly early and I callers
gonna<00:02:28.810> say<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:31.270> basically<00:02:31.660> how<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.830> works<00:02:33.070> is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
gonna say so basically how this works is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.800 
gonna say so basically how this works is
it<00:02:33.640> connects<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> any<00:02:34.420> block<00:02:34.900> around<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it connects to any block around the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
it connects to any block around the
elevator<00:02:37.810> plug<00:02:38.110> except<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:41.520> mud<00:02:43.680> or<00:02:44.680> dirt

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.690 

and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.510> can<00:02:49.660> control<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.680> by<00:02:50.860> using<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and then you can control it by using the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.110 
and then you can control it by using the
plus<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.510> minus<00:02:52.660> keys<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.640> as<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.880> saying

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
plus and minus keys so as I saying

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.600 
plus and minus keys so as I saying
that's<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.530> Zeppelin<00:02:56.530> mod<00:02:59.010> get<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.400> dark

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that's the Zeppelin mod get really dark

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.100 
that's the Zeppelin mod get really dark
here<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:05.590> one's<00:03:06.460> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.120> slightly

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
here and this one's going to be slightly

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.700 
here and this one's going to be slightly
larger<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.270> going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.570> be<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.930> my<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
larger this is going to be the my the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.830 
larger this is going to be the my the
main<00:03:15.660> shaft<00:03:16.660> from<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.820> because<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.540> already

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
main shaft from now on because I already

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.950 
main shaft from now on because I already
cleaned<00:03:20.380> out<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.100> other<00:03:21.370> one<00:03:21.580> from<00:03:22.060> diamonds

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
cleaned out the other one from diamonds

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.130 
cleaned out the other one from diamonds
and<00:03:23.230> many<00:03:23.830> resources<00:03:24.280> but<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.270> died<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.290> lava<00:03:28.140> so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
and many resources but I died in lava so

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:45.839 
and many resources but I died in lava so
that's<00:03:29.500> act

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.940 

so<00:03:46.849> many<00:03:46.999> missed<00:03:47.209> clicks

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.900
