 in fact to charge all your equipment 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 without needing to take 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 current and solar energy for 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.810
 some products like chargers 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810

 diodes actually light that is to say that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.370
 whenever you have loaded a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 once a diode will go out and you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.289
 have the right 4 full charge 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.090
 that's the first point the second 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.600
 point you can also use it 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.190
 like a small flashlight 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 what I passed and powerful 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 now i 'm doing so use it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 is really very simple you have this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.119
 little globe africa take you with 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 you who is not very heavy especially 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.320
 pretty small you have the usb cable that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.509
 also allows to be plugged into a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 outlet or to charge everything 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020
 just missing here is I branch a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 taken 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 I plug the power inc directly 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 above and to charge it to let go 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.710
 their country now to reload 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 your device very simply I withdraw 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 that I plug the usb on the power inc 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.659
 So I put a lot of studies 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.090
 connectivity to charges and iphone 4 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.850
 iphone points 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.950
 most samsung and sony ericsson 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 nokia and so on you put 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.100
 just shreds actually directly here 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.579
 that you dive directly into your 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.770
 phone 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 here after there is a little thing that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.869
 is nice for example there is no I the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.979
 know the connectivity for iphone 5 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.250
 you have to do a little thing 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.250
 very simple 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.570
 we actually take you directly to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.650
 iphone 5 cable 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.370
 it also works like that in fact what 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130
 you do it is that you can 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 directly in the body to the banks 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.430
 take your iphone 5 and you 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.710
 load good then it works it's 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.240
 also like that I had to spend a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.450
 good day I'll see you soon at 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.450
