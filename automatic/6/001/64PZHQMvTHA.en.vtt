00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
in the future the reason I decided to go

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.400

with<00:06:26.820> medium<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.420> extra-large<00:06:27.720> is<00:06:28.170> because

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
with medium and extra-large is because

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.600 
with medium and extra-large is because
there's<00:06:28.590> not<00:06:28.740> too<00:06:28.920> much<00:06:29.040> of<00:06:29.190> a<00:06:29.250> difference

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
between the small and the medium and

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.940 
between the small and the medium and
there's<00:06:31.200> not<00:06:31.350> too<00:06:31.500> much<00:06:31.620> of<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:31.860> difference

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
there's not too much of a difference

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.130 
there's not too much of a difference
between<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.550> XL<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.180> large<00:06:33.480> so<00:06:33.990> for

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
between the XL and the large so for

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.300 
between the XL and the large so for
someone<00:06:34.380> who<00:06:34.440> normally<00:06:34.560> wears<00:06:34.920> a<00:06:35.040> smaller

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
someone who normally wears a smaller

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.980 
someone who normally wears a smaller
medium<00:06:35.700> I'm<00:06:35.850> wearing<00:06:36.120> a<00:06:36.180> medium<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.690> it<00:06:36.810> fits

medium I'm wearing a medium and it fits

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.870 
medium I'm wearing a medium and it fits
fine<00:06:37.200> and<00:06:37.500> if<00:06:37.590> someone<00:06:37.890> were<00:06:38.040> small<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.520> think

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
fine and if someone were small I think

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.130 
fine and if someone were small I think
it'd<00:06:38.970> probably<00:06:39.060> fine<00:06:39.480> too<00:06:39.720> in<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:39.990> near

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
it'd probably fine too in the near

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.660 
it'd probably fine too in the near
future<00:06:40.320> I<00:06:40.530> am<00:06:40.740> going<00:06:40.980> to<00:06:41.040> be<00:06:41.100> getting<00:06:41.190> larger
