00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 it is you very well thank you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.080
 you will present us today a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.999
 very well known machine senseo 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 but with a particularity since 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.080
 this one is the senseo cappuccino 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.520
 cappuccino so very simple 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.830
 of use is a little the principle 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 of the scene that's at least that's what he 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 is in addition it is the container go yes 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 so easy to use jallet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.199
 go up against me and he has a little demo 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 a little a little cappuccino a little 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 cappuccino so we opted for leverage 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.700
 with which lever we insert the small 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 container to the clip it's the same 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 ready that's right it's there 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 second is better indeed so small 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.850
 Senseo soft pods 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's the scene editing 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 today it is possible to find 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.170
 obviously the senseo pods house the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.090
 coffee I think but we also have a street 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 a wide choice of our dose is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.019
 totally compatible including a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.809
 organic range that some cons 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.700
 maxi koffi distribution here it allows 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.180
 to be able to choose the coffee of your choice 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 two hundred is with his best so that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 remains simple black coffee drawing 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 cappuccino agree a pressure for 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.259
 black coffee pressure so that the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 simple puccino ready and that's it 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.690
 everywhere leaking in place is not it's 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.700
 perfect 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.360
 so in fact we have been told 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.510
 mr r actually just did you 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.510
 and a beautiful star 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.210
 the chord extraction so let's remember 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.000
 still we are not sure 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.790
 espresso since we have the choice of 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 pressure of 1.5 or bearded like that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.920
 quite so here we are not on 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.650
 fees are we are sure 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.020
 we will say the equivalent of a coffee 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.780
 coffee maker with a little pressure and the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.659
 little more senseo this famous the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 famous moussa monusco treat yourself 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.149
 go then if we want to draw a little 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.819
 plus its floors and a little tip 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.530
 still it's a little bit turned 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.510
 not always 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.760
 Here it can actually turn green 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.060
 like that and we find all three 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.660
 floors 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.580
 that's it if we want to stay more risted then 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.670
 why in fact we have three floors all 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.530
 simply because the milk and the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.760
 the heavier fluid so it's going to get 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.440
 put down the coffee is a little bit 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.130
 the more the medium and the milk froth is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.989
 very light 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:43.600
 she stays up go I taste a 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:47.110
 little bit everywhere then we have we have less 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 the milk foam rather aerial 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 obviously I who are used to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.550
 drink a lot of cappuccino 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.870
 - the intense side of dca puccino have 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.610
 made with espresso machine but it's 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.900
 normal but we have a result that is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.269
 quite honorable final 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.739
 here and small details what has 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.910
 really at Senseo is that before we 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.620
 had the opportunity to make 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.840
 cappuccino thanks to its famous pods 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.720
 sewell cappuccino that has been with milk 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.850
 in addition we say and there it allows to 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.410
 make a cappuccino with real and 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.400
 with all its fruits with fresh milk 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.260
 it's not insignificant 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.530
 it's necessarily better it's a fact 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.560
 quite so that's it for the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.500
 cappuccino just a little detail but 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.060
 for those who have already found their 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.450
 coffee we will say and that it does not happen 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.290
 go find in es2 and two years 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.940
 pod farm 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.209
 there are these famous pods 2 is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.190
 permanent fallout that just fill 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.950
 of his ground coffee of his choice 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.540
 Okay, I'll give you a little test 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.250
 to see if we have the same the same 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.540
 coffee result with her breasts for m 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.859
 that's important exactly then 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.160
 I do it right now so doors 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.769
 cc2 cups filter is permanent 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.329
 okay so it's always the same 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.760
 so simple then by cons you do not 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.930
 will be able to make that one coffee only 1 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.739
 the one who made the inventory of all 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.120
 his actors so I said everything to 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.209
 the hour of saints black coffee a 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 pressure okay and let's go this 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.109
 article 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.349
 so we should have what 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.689
 before we have that we should see again body 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.560
 in front of the same result as a coffee 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.539
 pods 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.159
 but same result as with coffee 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.820
 bacon pods exactly with 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.270
 intensity 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.790
 chose the course coffee you put 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.180
 in okay so here it is 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.340
 result 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.750
 you see it's exactly but with 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.710
 doses the same thing this title m 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.030
 that's the exception, but we can do it with the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.370
 coffee of your choice if you want to put a 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.230
 great vintage inside despite what we 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.390
 may not necessarily have to do with the same 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.300
 if we have a very broadly quite 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:04.050
 effect again a typical coffee 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.400
 filter but with a nice foam because 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.860
 that it's still so antoniewicz and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.230
 we are all equal smc high but we 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.390
 still has a nice foam on her 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.930
 coffee that's it 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.150
 if I do a little summary of 2.7 senseo 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.310
 capucci will have nothing revolutionary 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.080
 it's a senseo 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.340
 we attack, we know who 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.060
 that they pay a lot a lot of 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.380
 people in France and abroad 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.820
 but with the possibility of doing 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.440
 a real cap o chinon ie 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.060
 with fresh milk this is the 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.890
 big advantage of machines obviously 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.390
 for the richest those who love the 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.770
 true cappuccino it will be a little bit 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.480
 disappointed because we do not have an expression 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.170
 inside but a lot more coffee 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.000
 but that's exactly it remains a 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.380
 beautiful machine quite well and 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.590
 remember still a very point 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.760
 positive that we are on a cappuccino 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.900
 will say one touch ie 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.950
 just call on a touch a year with 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.230
 a little luck and that's still 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.580
 super nice for a machine that they 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.490
 do not doubt very expensive we stay on a 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.170
 system certainly quite thank you at noon 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.210
 for his bath demonstration with big 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.690
 pleasure and see you soon enough to 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.300
 something else 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.800
 kft detailed alain pistons 30 at sion 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.150
 of coffee which will be fun and passion 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.050
 very well thank you 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.050
 thunderstruck
