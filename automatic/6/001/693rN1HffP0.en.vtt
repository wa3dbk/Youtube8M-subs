inverters<00:01:58.730> so<00:01:58.940> I'll<00:01:59.060> do<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> video<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.600> that

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
inverters so I'll do a video on that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.740 
inverters so I'll do a video on that
another<00:02:00.920> project<00:02:01.190> I've<00:02:01.550> got<00:02:01.790> is<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> charge

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
another project I've got is a charge

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.490 
another project I've got is a charge
station<00:02:03.230> for<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.710> battery<00:02:04.160> bank<00:02:04.430> I've<00:02:04.700> got<00:02:05.330> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
station for that battery bank I've got a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.930 
station for that battery bank I've got a
five<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.710> half<00:02:06.770> horse<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.340> come<00:02:07.520> some<00:02:07.790> motor

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
five and a half horse to come some motor

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.359 
five and a half horse to come some motor
and<00:02:08.210> I'm<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.960> run<00:02:09.170> at<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.440> ninety<00:02:09.950> five<00:02:09.980> am

and I'm going to run at a ninety five am

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.780 
and I'm going to run at a ninety five am
GM<00:02:10.700> alternator<00:02:11.420> off<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.020> Tacoma<00:02:12.380> motor

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
GM alternator off of that Tacoma motor

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
GM alternator off of that Tacoma motor
which<00:02:13.790> will<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.480> turn<00:02:14.960> run<00:02:15.230> off<00:02:15.350> my

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
which will be in turn run off my

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.710 
which will be in turn run off my
gasifier<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.400> charge<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.820> battery<00:02:17.240> bank<00:02:17.450> kind

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
gasifier to charge my battery bank kind

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.160 
gasifier to charge my battery bank kind
of<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.250> off-grid<00:02:19.250> experiment<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.810> want

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
of a little off-grid experiment I want

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530 
of a little off-grid experiment I want
to<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.440> video<00:02:21.770> on<00:02:21.980> some<00:02:22.460> oil<00:02:22.700> lamps<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.270> also

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
to do a video on some oil lamps and also

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.230 
to do a video on some oil lamps and also
kerosene<00:02:24.050> heaters<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.340> there's<00:02:25.520> six

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
kerosene heaters so you know there's six

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.720 
kerosene heaters so you know there's six
six<00:02:27.170> new<00:02:27.410> videos<00:02:27.800> I'm<00:02:28.040> thinking<00:02:28.310> about<00:02:28.490> doing

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
six new videos I'm thinking about doing

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.970 
six new videos I'm thinking about doing
here<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.090> sometimes<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.200> your<00:02:30.230> future<00:02:30.710> you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
here now sometimes in your future you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.530 
here now sometimes in your future you
know<00:02:31.100> dribble<00:02:31.580> them<00:02:31.700> out<00:02:31.820> here<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.180> there<00:02:32.300> as

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
know dribble them out here and there as

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.140 
know dribble them out here and there as
time<00:02:33.020> permits<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.310> there<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.730> there's<00:02:35.030> going

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
time permits so there is there's going

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.140 
time permits so there is there's going
to<00:02:35.239> update<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> gas<00:02:35.870> fire
