right for the new Lane Cruiser yep it's
actually<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.519> simple<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.090> over<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.330> think

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
actually pretty simple to over I think

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.759 
actually pretty simple to over I think
even<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.960> could<00:00:25.019> draw<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:28.050> card<00:00:28.289> does<00:00:28.500> appear

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
even you could draw the card does appear

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.519 
even you could draw the card does appear
bit<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> itself<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.789> yeah<00:00:30.179> okay<00:00:30.720> cool<00:00:31.109> let's

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
bit of it itself so yeah okay cool let's

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.310 
bit of it itself so yeah okay cool let's
see<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> we're<00:00:33.930> obviously<00:00:33.989> on

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
see what it can do so we're obviously on

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
see what it can do so we're obviously on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
now you could have plenty of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
now you could have plenty of
Landcruisers<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.179> day<00:01:33.329> how<00:01:34.079> does<00:01:34.229> this

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Landcruisers in your day how does this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.529 
Landcruisers in your day how does this
one<00:01:34.560> differ<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.219> old<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.240> main

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
one differ from the old one the main

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.080 
one differ from the old one the main
difference<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.350> wheel<00:01:38.069> articulation<00:01:38.340> on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
difference is the wheel articulation on

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
difference is the wheel articulation on
the<00:01:39.210> vehicle<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.869> crawl<00:01:40.140> functions<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the vehicle and the crawl functions a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.580 
the vehicle and the crawl functions a
brand<00:01:41.039> new<00:01:41.219> function<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.630> far<00:01:42.929> all<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.409> done

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
brand new function so far all I've done

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.080 
brand new function so far all I've done
is<00:01:43.649> steered<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.159> car<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:44.549> using<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is steered the car I'm not using the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.599 
is steered the car I'm not using the
pedals<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.530> picking<00:01:46.859> its<00:01:47.009> own<00:01:47.189> speed

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
pedals at all it's picking its own speed

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.480 
pedals at all it's picking its own speed
and<00:01:47.969> it<00:01:48.959> does<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:49.409> good<00:01:49.500> job<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and it does a pretty good job of it and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.859 
and it does a pretty good job of it and
it'll<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> uphill<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.569> downhill

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it'll do that uphill and downhill

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
it'll do that uphill and downhill
obviously<00:01:52.409> yet<00:01:52.890> we'll<00:01:53.130> show<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.819> on<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
obviously yet we'll show it on the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
obviously yet we'll show it on the
uphill<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.929> on<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.349> person<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.099> you'd

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
uphill over here on this person as you'd

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.660 
uphill over here on this person as you'd
pick<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.909> pedals<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:59.039> takes<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.609> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pick up the pedals it takes it out of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.339 
pick up the pedals it takes it out of
that<00:01:59.909> function<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.599> if<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:00.990> accelerate

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
that function so if I want to accelerate

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.289 
that function so if I want to accelerate
now<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.039> can<00:02:02.189> go<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> next<00:02:04.849> next<00:02:05.849> obstacle

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
now we can go to the next next obstacle

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.539 
now we can go to the next next obstacle
as<00:02:07.020> soon<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.319> I<00:02:07.409> take<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> foot<00:02:07.979> back<00:02:08.160> off<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
as soon as I take the foot back off the

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.819 
as soon as I take the foot back off the
accelerator<00:02:08.810> it'll<00:02:09.810> activate<00:02:10.110> again<00:02:10.590> so

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
accelerator it'll activate again so

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.589 
accelerator it'll activate again so
it'll<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.129> speak<00:02:11.519> its<00:02:11.700> own<00:02:11.849> speed<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.510> up

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it'll just speak its own speed to go up

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.539 
it'll just speak its own speed to go up
this<00:02:12.750> hill<00:02:13.019> here<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.530> I'm<00:02:13.980> assuming<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
this hill here and I'm assuming if you

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.860 
this hill here and I'm assuming if you
hit<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> brakes<00:02:15.030> obviously<00:02:15.450> that'll<00:02:15.660> cancel

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
hit the brakes obviously that'll cancel

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.000 
hit the brakes obviously that'll cancel
oh<00:02:16.170> yes<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.560> will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
oh yes it will

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.460 
oh yes it will
we<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.849> also<00:02:18.000> speed<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.019> bit<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.319> got

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
we can also speed that up a bit it's got

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.199 
we can also speed that up a bit it's got
three<00:02:19.739> settings<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:23.549> you'd<00:02:23.730> probably<00:02:23.910> want

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
three settings and you'd probably want

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
three settings and you'd probably want
to<00:02:24.269> go<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.660> slower<00:02:24.959> setting<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:25.680> steep

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
to go and the slower setting for steep

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.690 
to go and the slower setting for steep
downhill<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:28.019> no<00:02:28.200> brakes<00:02:28.500> no<00:02:29.099> brakes<00:02:29.129> of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
downhill so again no brakes no brakes of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
downhill so again no brakes no brakes of
cars<00:02:29.910> doing<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.329> all<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.680> mentioned<00:02:31.980> before

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
cars doing at all you mentioned before

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.599 
cars doing at all you mentioned before
the<00:02:32.569> suspension<00:02:33.599> yeah<00:02:34.109> the<00:02:34.290> kdss<00:02:34.980> suspension

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
the suspension yeah the kdss suspension

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.039 
the suspension yeah the kdss suspension
which<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.910> kinetic<00:02:36.389> dynamic<00:02:36.599> suspension

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
which is kinetic dynamic suspension

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.039 
which is kinetic dynamic suspension
system<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.700> does<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.819> do<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
system and what does that do what it

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.319 
system and what does that do what it
does<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.709> sway<00:02:40.980> bars<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> fluid

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
does that the sway bars have a fluid

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.240 
does that the sway bars have a fluid
link<00:02:42.720> between<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.260> front<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.769> rear<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
link between the front and the rear and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.460 
link between the front and the rear and
when<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.420> has<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.900> use<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.290> wheel

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
when it has to use the wheel

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.650 
when it has to use the wheel
articulation<00:02:47.510> there<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.720> no<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.389> fluid

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
articulation there is no there is fluid

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
articulation there is no there is fluid
transfer<00:02:52.410> between<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.980> two<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.239> get<00:02:54.540> no

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
transfer between the two so we get no

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.479 
transfer between the two so we get no
resistance<00:02:55.319> from<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.590> sway<00:02:55.829> bars<00:02:56.190> which

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
resistance from the sway bars which

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.210 
resistance from the sway bars which
usually<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:57.180> stop<00:02:57.510> wheel<00:02:57.690> articulation<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.980> we

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
usually do stop wheel articulation so we

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.360 
usually do stop wheel articulation so we
get<00:02:59.810> when<00:03:00.810> we're<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.349> road<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.190> car

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
get when we're on the road and the car

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.020 
get when we're on the road and the car
starts<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> corner<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.599> lean<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.380> get<00:03:05.030> no

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
starts to corner and lean we get no

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.720 
starts to corner and lean we get no
fluid<00:03:06.510> transfer<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.190> sway<00:03:08.400> bars

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
fluid transfer then and the sway bars

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.220 
fluid transfer then and the sway bars
are<00:03:08.910> very<00:03:09.090> stiff<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.660> we've<00:03:09.780> got<00:03:09.959> very<00:03:10.169> good

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
are very stiff so we've got very good

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.259 
are very stiff so we've got very good
roll<00:03:10.590> stiffness<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.340> road<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.880> stop<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
roll stiffness on road to stop the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.120 
roll stiffness on road to stop the
vehicle<00:03:12.660> leaning<00:03:13.049> around<00:03:13.169> corners<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:13.799> so

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
vehicle leaning around corners and so

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.449 
vehicle leaning around corners and so
forth<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.239> off-road<00:03:16.079> conditions<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:17.310> get

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
forth but in off-road conditions we get

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.390 
forth but in off-road conditions we get
all<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.720> fluid<00:03:19.200> transfer<00:03:19.560> pass<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.310> each

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
all the fluid transfer pass to each

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.770 
all the fluid transfer pass to each
other<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.150> full<00:03:21.329> wheel<00:03:21.540> articulation

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
other so we get full wheel articulation

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.960 
other so we get full wheel articulation
there's<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.769> 40<00:03:23.220> percent<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:23.609> wheel

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
there's about 40 percent more wheel

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.909 
there's about 40 percent more wheel
articulation<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:25.109> that<00:03:25.319> system<00:03:25.769> than

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
articulation with that system than

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.520 
articulation with that system than
without<00:03:26.280> right

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
without right

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.340 
without right
and<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.100> standard<00:03:28.670> yes<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.870> standard

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
and is that standard yes that standard

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.190 
and is that standard yes that standard
on<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.590> model<00:03:30.830> okay<00:03:31.660> from<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.810> outside

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
on this model okay from the outside

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.480 
on this model okay from the outside
obviously<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.680> landcruiser<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.250> doesn't

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
obviously the landcruiser that doesn't

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.950 
obviously the landcruiser that doesn't
look<00:03:34.610> radically<00:03:34.940> different<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.630> old<00:03:35.780> one

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
look radically different to the old one

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.020 
look radically different to the old one
they've<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.260> sort<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.760> titled<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.820> up<00:03:37.940> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
they've just sort of titled it up a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.490 
they've just sort of titled it up a
little<00:03:38.180> bit<00:03:38.330> giving<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.720> few<00:03:38.870> square<00:03:39.230> edges

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
little bit giving it a few square edges

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.840 
little bit giving it a few square edges
here<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:39.890> there<00:03:40.130> but<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.460> terms<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
here and there but in terms of the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.370 
here and there but in terms of the
overall<00:03:41.270> shape<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.810> not<00:03:41.840> radically

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
overall shape it's not radically

rough<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.560> rocky<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.980> stuff<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:19.669> is

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
rough and rocky this stuff is but it is

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.430 
rough and rocky this stuff is but it is
pretty<00:04:20.000> bad<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.419> while<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.959> camera<00:04:21.230> may<00:04:21.380> be

pretty bad and while the camera may be

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.750 
pretty bad and while the camera may be
bobbing<00:04:22.010> around<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.310> little<00:04:22.400> bit<00:04:22.610> it's

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
bobbing around a little bit it's

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.610 
bobbing around a little bit it's
certainly<00:04:23.090> doing<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.870> reasonable<00:04:24.320> job<00:04:24.350> of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
certainly doing a reasonable job of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.840

yep yeah the crawl function makes that's
what<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.860> noise<00:05:15.010> is<00:05:15.070> there<00:05:15.580> but<00:05:15.850> as<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.120> can

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
what the noise is there but as you can

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.930 
what the noise is there but as you can
see<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.750> gets<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.590> vehicle<00:05:17.950> over<00:05:18.340> those<00:05:18.640> quite
