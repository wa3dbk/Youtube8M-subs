00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 very tasty dish 40 may I may like 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 stuck in the earth but that is not 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 Nuclear real if you grafted down there 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:42.690
 I do not know what's really coming out 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 Now I've had a neighbor 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.320
 actually no grab those 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.340
 the leaves remove the other one 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.199
 neighbor says that is and that is real 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 has since I've drawn two 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.379
 years ago, a little piece 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.579
 the cores cleansed and now wanted 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.799
 but I have seen that one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 is expelled then I have in one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.900
 pot planted 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.860
 who is already quite tall? 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.860
 become that first 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.390
 that pretty sturdy 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.630
 he sits here, of course, no such 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:54.830
 a wire basket for protection against here 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:56.420
 I clearly see you again 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.000
 smaller but that was much bigger 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.280
 The tailor has cut it out like this 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.290
 fully protected at 40 he is 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:11.660
 I had to get a few 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:15.200
 but as I said but for mid september 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.040
 it is quite as good as it is here 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.040
 again one 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.550
 but I find it pretty grown 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.100
 but must now all currently in the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.880
 earth and still difficult now a place 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.860
 to find 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.489
 this is not a sheltered place i have 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.870
 no longer here but already more open 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.130
 but that will survive if 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.530
 I can hold the small one to that 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.470
 maybe also in the spring outpost 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.150
 protect by flowing superior here 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.540
 So here I would like to stand 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.050
 theme would have loved a bit away 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.940
 I'm here four then here again 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.340
 the bed is a northwest 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.609
 there is not much foreclosed by the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.590
 Become the bit bigger then 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.590
 one more front and one here 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:47.729
 pretty sandy earth thicker pure 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:52.050
 make it very difficult 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.050
 only one thing must not be cold to me 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.180
 440 little trees give me that little one now 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.389
 actually a piece over your knee is more 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.389
 that's not it's not in the pot 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:03.919
 yes, already shadow this fish 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 here and here is the dinner in the 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:18.219
 bag there is now krimphove paprika 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:18.219
 Eggplant tomatoes and arugula salad
