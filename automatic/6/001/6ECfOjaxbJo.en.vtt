make it a little bit bigger and this
should<00:01:33.960> work<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.439> tried<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.950> without<00:01:35.390> this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
should work I tried it without this

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.050 
should work I tried it without this

firewall<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.220> way<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.430> adjust<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
firewall the way you adjust it as you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.380 
firewall the way you adjust it as you
screw<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.069> try<00:02:42.610> pushing<00:02:43.209> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
screw it in and then you try pushing the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240 
screw it in and then you try pushing the
clutch<00:02:43.629> pedal<00:02:43.900> down<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.560> moving<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> shift

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
clutch pedal down and moving the shift

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.160 
clutch pedal down and moving the shift
lever<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.330> gear<00:02:46.599> with<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> motor

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
lever in and out of gear with the motor

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.550 
lever in and out of gear with the motor
off<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.610> won't<00:02:48.760> release<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.989> won't<00:02:50.170> move<00:02:50.349> in

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
off if it won't release it won't move in

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.490 
off if it won't release it won't move in
and<00:02:50.739> out<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:51.010> gear<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:52.239> your<00:02:52.720> adjuster<00:02:53.260> is

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
and out of gear then your adjuster is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740 
and out of gear then your adjuster is
not<00:02:53.680> low<00:02:54.430> enough<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.730> need<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.150> screw<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.660> in

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
not low enough you need to screw it in

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.740 
not low enough you need to screw it in
more<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.360> that's<00:02:58.690> kind<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.500> a<00:03:00.750> iterative

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
more so it's that's kind of a iterative

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.080 
more so it's that's kind of a iterative
process<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.829> have<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.130> try<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> trial<00:03:03.880> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
process you have to try a trial and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.589 
process you have to try a trial and
error<00:03:04.299> process<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.610> adjusted<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:07.510> I'm

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
error process to get it adjusted so I'm

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.509 
error process to get it adjusted so I'm
going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.810> put<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.739> then<00:03:09.370> I'm

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
going to put it in now and then I'm

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.890 
going to put it in now and then I'm
going<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.620> try<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.769> move<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.420> push<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.599> pedal

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
going to try and move the push the pedal

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.360 
going to try and move the push the pedal
down<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.290> try<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.500> move<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.099> out<00:03:15.220> of

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
down and try and move it in and out of

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.280 
down and try and move it in and out of
gear<00:03:16.889> well<00:03:17.889> there<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.489> screwed<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:18.970> in

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
gear well there it is I screwed it in

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.420 
gear well there it is I screwed it in
I'm<00:03:20.290> going<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> try<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.859> all<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.160> way<00:03:21.400> down

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
I'm going to try it all the way down

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.449 
I'm going to try it all the way down
there<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.359> as<00:03:23.019> far<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.319> I<00:03:23.500> can<00:03:23.560> screw<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.069> in<00:03:24.190> if

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
there to as far as I can screw it in if

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.009 
there to as far as I can screw it in if
that's<00:03:24.609> not<00:03:24.850> low<00:03:25.090> enough<00:03:25.120> I'll<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.810> cut

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
that's not low enough I'll have to cut

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.470 
that's not low enough I'll have to cut
off<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> bolt<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.850> try<00:03:28.420> it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
off a little bit of the bolt and try it

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.930 
off a little bit of the bolt and try it
again<00:03:28.709> well<00:03:29.709> let's<00:03:29.889> try<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.549> how<00:03:30.790> it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
again well let's try that and see how it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.400 
again well let's try that and see how it
works<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.540> tested<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.709> found<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
works I tested it and I found that the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.479 
works I tested it and I found that the
the<00:03:35.920> clutch<00:03:36.160> would<00:03:36.370> disengage<00:03:36.790> okay<00:03:37.450> but<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
the clutch would disengage okay but the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.129 
the clutch would disengage okay but the
engagement<00:03:39.489> was<00:03:39.970> pretty<00:03:40.329> low<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.810> floor

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
engagement was pretty low to the floor

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.309 
engagement was pretty low to the floor
so<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.590> want<00:03:41.889> to<00:03:42.120> raise<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.480> up<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.900> little<00:03:44.109> bit

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
so I want to raise that up a little bit

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.650 
so I want to raise that up a little bit
so<00:03:44.650> what<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:46.030> I'm<00:03:46.420> going<00:03:46.480> to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.059 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
shorten<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.799> screws<00:03:48.280> into<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:50.069> receiver

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
shorten this it screws into the receiver

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.370 
shorten this it screws into the receiver
in<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.549> firewall<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.389> about<00:03:52.660> three<00:03:52.930> quarters

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
in the firewall and about three quarters

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.030 
in the firewall and about three quarters
of<00:03:53.410> an<00:03:53.650> inch<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.100> I'm<00:03:54.220> going<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.489> take<00:03:55.650> almost<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
of an inch so I'm going to take almost a

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.289 
of an inch so I'm going to take almost a
quarter<00:03:57.459> inch<00:03:57.670> off<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:59.790> yeah<00:04:00.790> about<00:04:01.120> a

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
quarter inch off of that yeah about a

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.720 
quarter inch off of that yeah about a
quarter<00:04:01.870> inch<00:04:01.900> off<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.160> then<00:04:03.519> it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
quarter inch off of that and then it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.569 
quarter inch off of that and then it
should<00:04:04.150> give<00:04:04.810> me<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> nice<00:04:05.260> feel<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.250> the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
should give me a nice feel for the

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.289 
should give me a nice feel for the
clutch<00:04:06.790> pedal

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
clutch pedal

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.400 
clutch pedal
I<00:04:07.650> found<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.769> nut<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.510> right<00:04:10.720> thread

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
I found a nut that is the right thread

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.699 
I found a nut that is the right thread
so<00:04:12.280> I'm<00:04:13.269> going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.510> use<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> cut-off<00:04:14.230> wheel<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
so I'm going to use a cut-off wheel to

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.449 
so I'm going to use a cut-off wheel to
cut<00:04:14.919> it<00:04:15.099> here<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.639> then<00:04:16.090> when<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.190> take<00:04:18.190> this

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
cut it here and then when I take this

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.140 
cut it here and then when I take this
nut<00:04:18.940> off<00:04:19.180> it'll<00:04:20.109> it'll<00:04:20.709> make<00:04:20.919> it'll<00:04:21.880> make<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
nut off it'll it'll make it'll make the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.210 
nut off it'll it'll make it'll make the
threads<00:04:22.419> nice<00:04:22.690> it'll<00:04:22.960> make<00:04:23.110> sure<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.530> my

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
threads nice it'll make sure that my

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.830 
threads nice it'll make sure that my
cutoff<00:04:24.490> wheel<00:04:24.789> is<00:04:24.940> pretty<00:04:25.180> good

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
cutoff wheel is pretty good

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.470 
cutoff wheel is pretty good
if<00:04:26.050> it<00:04:26.260> has<00:04:26.440> any<00:04:26.650> little<00:04:26.949> rough<00:04:27.100> spots<00:04:27.480> this

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
if it has any little rough spots this

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.120 
if it has any little rough spots this
should<00:04:28.690> take<00:04:28.840> care<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.680> also<00:04:29.800> take<00:04:30.070> a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
should take care of it I can also take a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.610 
should take care of it I can also take a
little<00:04:30.400> file<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:31.030> even<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:31.780> off<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.169> need<00:04:32.230> to

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
little file and even it off I need to

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.439 
little file and even it off I need to
smooth<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.190> out

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.969

screw into the firewall three-quarters
of<00:05:05.910> an<00:05:06.150> inch<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.600> means<00:05:06.810> it'll<00:05:06.990> be<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.620> much

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
of an inch that means it'll be that much

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.770 
of an inch that means it'll be that much
lower<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:09.300> my<00:05:09.780> clutch<00:05:10.500> pedal<00:05:11.070> on

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
lower so my clutch pedal on

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.390 
lower so my clutch pedal on
disengagement<00:05:12.780> will<00:05:13.290> go<00:05:13.470> down<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:14.130> much

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
disengagement will go down that much

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.980 
disengagement will go down that much
lower<00:05:14.670> and<00:05:14.970> we'll<00:05:15.120> take<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.390> little<00:05:15.750> bit<00:05:15.870> of

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
lower and we'll take a little bit of

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.720 
lower and we'll take a little bit of
time<00:05:16.200> before<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.740> engages<00:05:17.310> when<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.550> comes

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
time before it engages when it comes

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.810 
time before it engages when it comes
back<00:05:17.970> up<00:05:18.240> let's<00:05:18.930> screw<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.290> in<00:05:19.410> okay<00:05:20.370> there<00:05:20.670> it

back up let's screw it in okay there it
is<00:05:20.880> screwed<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.600> it<00:05:21.720> does<00:05:21.930> look<00:05:22.170> like<00:05:22.200> it's

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.420 
the motor shut off and then I'm going to
try<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.570> with<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.780> motor<00:05:33.990> turned<00:05:34.410> on<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.070> see

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
how I like that the clutch pedal

how I like that the clutch pedal
distance<00:05:41.370> how<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.640> like<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.090> feel<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:43.010> well

distance how I like the feel of it well

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.980 
distance how I like the feel of it well
I<00:05:44.040> think<00:05:44.190> that's<00:05:44.550> pretty<00:05:44.820> good<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.660> good

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
I think that's pretty good it's good

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
like it to engage way up here when I

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.050

engage pretty low so I'm going to leave

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.290 
engage pretty low so I'm going to leave
it<00:06:15.540> right<00:06:15.660> there<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:16.800> if<00:06:17.760> you<00:06:17.880> wanted<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.180> go

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
it right there and if you wanted to go

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.030 
it right there and if you wanted to go
lower<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.690> just<00:06:18.990> cut<00:06:19.170> a<00:06:19.200> little<00:06:19.410> bit<00:06:19.530> more<00:06:19.860> off

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
lower you just cut a little bit more off

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.010 
lower you just cut a little bit more off
that<00:06:20.280> bolt<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.700> go<00:06:22.430> lower<00:06:23.430> meaning<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.420> bolt

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
that bolt and go lower meaning the bolt

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.940 
that bolt and go lower meaning the bolt
would<00:06:25.230> go<00:06:25.670> more<00:06:26.670> or<00:06:27.090> lower<00:06:27.360> into<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.920> the

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
would go more or lower into the to the

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.580 
would go more or lower into the to the
firewall<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.780> pedal<00:06:31.140> would<00:06:31.260> engage

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
firewall and the pedal would engage

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.760 
firewall and the pedal would engage
higher<00:06:32.010> so<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:32.970> shorter<00:06:33.510> that<00:06:34.160> bolt<00:06:35.160> is<00:06:36.770> the

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
higher so the shorter that bolt is the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.260 
higher so the shorter that bolt is the
more<00:06:38.070> distance<00:06:38.670> you're<00:06:38.820> going<00:06:38.850> to<00:06:39.030> have

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
more distance you're going to have

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.970 
more distance you're going to have
because<00:06:40.020> when<00:06:40.170> you<00:06:40.260> push<00:06:40.440> down<00:06:40.470> you're

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
because when you push down you're

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.890 
because when you push down you're
pushing<00:06:41.250> it<00:06:41.370> down<00:06:41.550> further<00:06:41.880> who<00:06:42.390> comes<00:06:42.660> up

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
pushing it down further who comes up

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.240 
pushing it down further who comes up
you're<00:06:43.140> going<00:06:43.230> to<00:06:43.290> have<00:06:43.440> some<00:06:43.650> distance<00:06:43.950> there

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
you're going to have some distance there

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.390 
you're going to have some distance there
whatever<00:06:45.000> you<00:06:45.240> cut<00:06:45.420> off<00:06:45.630> from<00:06:45.810> that<00:06:45.960> bolt<00:06:46.400> okay

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
whatever you cut off from that bolt okay
