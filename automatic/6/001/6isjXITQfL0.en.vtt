Fiat India CEO mr. Griffith Abu baraa
this<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.420> what<00:01:13.660> he<00:01:13.840> had<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.110> say<00:01:14.140> well<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.100> fuel

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
this is what he had to say well the fuel

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is what he had to say well the fuel
efficiency<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:16.090> an<00:01:16.240> engine<00:01:16.830> largely<00:01:17.830> depends

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
efficiency of an engine largely depends

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320 
efficiency of an engine largely depends
on<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.740> injection<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.010> therefore<00:01:21.940> are

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
on the injection and therefore are

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.800 
on the injection and therefore are
subsequently<00:01:23.310> efficient<00:01:24.310> combustion<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
subsequently efficient combustion and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.389 
subsequently efficient combustion and
reducing<00:01:26.410> friction<00:01:27.150> frictional<00:01:28.150> losses<00:01:28.390> in

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
reducing friction frictional losses in

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.330 
reducing friction frictional losses in
so<00:01:29.909> Fiat<00:01:30.899> has<00:01:31.049> worked<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.439> both<00:01:31.649> these<00:01:31.829> aspects

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
so Fiat has worked on both these aspects

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.410 
so Fiat has worked on both these aspects
as<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.979> pioneered<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.939> current

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as you know here pioneered the current

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
as you know here pioneered the current
injection<00:01:36.750> systems<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.469> have<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.649> used<00:01:37.770> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
injection systems that have been used on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
injection systems that have been used on
all<00:01:38.420> modern<00:01:39.420> Diesel's<00:01:39.929> so<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.179> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
all modern Diesel's so that that is that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.580 
all modern Diesel's so that that is that
is<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.679> our<00:01:44.689> engines<00:01:45.689> fuel<00:01:46.170> efficient

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is what makes our engines fuel efficient

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.209 
is what makes our engines fuel efficient
and<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.429> makes<00:01:49.039> engines<00:01:50.039> and

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
and it's also what makes engines and

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.940 
and it's also what makes engines and
generally<00:01:50.670> fuel-efficient<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.200> multi<00:01:52.649> jet

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
generally fuel-efficient so multi jet

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.749 
generally fuel-efficient so multi jet
would<00:01:53.219> be<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.959> injections<00:01:55.439> for

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
would be like more injections for

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
would be like more injections for
exactly<00:01:56.759> yeah

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
exactly yeah

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
exactly yeah
that's<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:58.079> where<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> name<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.219> derived

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's that's where the name is derived

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.460 
that's that's where the name is derived
from<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.630> multiple<00:02:00.899> injections

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
from you can do multiple injections

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.359 
from you can do multiple injections
during<00:02:02.099> one<00:02:02.880> combustion<00:02:03.509> cycle<00:02:03.959> and<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
during one combustion cycle and yeah the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.679 
during one combustion cycle and yeah the
name<00:02:05.520> comes<00:02:05.789> from<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.209> guess<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.450> didn't

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
name comes from there I guess you didn't

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.410 
name comes from there I guess you didn't
freeze<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.049> back<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.349> five<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.829> eight<00:02:09.619> okay<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
freeze it back to five to eight okay the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.729 
freeze it back to five to eight okay the

on one of our petrol engines that's used

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.000 
on one of our petrol engines that's used
it's<00:03:39.980> basically<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.849> have<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.239> most

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
it's basically to have the most

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.420 
it's basically to have the most
appropriate<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.640> air<00:03:44.530> intake<00:03:45.530> into<00:03:45.920> into<00:03:46.310> the

appropriate in air intake into into the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.640 
appropriate in air intake into into the
engine<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.170> don't<00:03:48.379> have<00:03:48.500> too

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
engine so so that you don't have too

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.869 
engine so so that you don't have too
much<00:03:48.859> air<00:03:49.489> when<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:49.970> don't<00:03:50.180> require<00:03:50.480> it

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
much air when you don't require it

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.160 
much air when you don't require it
so<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:53.030> automobile<00:03:53.480> engineers<00:03:53.930> and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
so the automobile engineers and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.539 
so the automobile engineers and
scientists<00:03:54.859> took<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.159> blame<00:03:55.400> upon

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
scientists took the blame upon

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.610 
scientists took the blame upon
themselves<00:03:55.939> and<00:03:56.359> reduced<00:03:56.900> fuel<00:03:57.109> consumption

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
themselves and reduced fuel consumption

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.949 
themselves and reduced fuel consumption
through<00:03:58.069> better<00:03:58.280> engine<00:03:58.760> technologies<00:03:59.359> but

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
through better engine technologies but

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.199 
through better engine technologies but
that<00:04:00.139> in<00:04:00.349> turn<00:04:00.379> made<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:00.950> think<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.579> now<00:04:01.790> my

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that in turn made you think well now my

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.490 
that in turn made you think well now my
car<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.569> giving<00:04:02.689> me<00:04:02.930> great<00:04:03.169> fuel<00:04:03.439> economy

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
car is giving me great fuel economy

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.770 
car is giving me great fuel economy
figure<00:04:04.189> so<00:04:04.430> why<00:04:04.579> not<00:04:04.760> use<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.239> buy<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> loaf

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
figure so why not use it to buy a loaf

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.420 
figure so why not use it to buy a loaf
of<00:04:05.989> bread<00:04:06.049> from<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.470> corner<00:04:06.799> shop<00:04:06.829> in<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.250> car

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.699 
of bread from the corner shop in the car
itself<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.060> why<00:04:08.659> not<00:04:08.870> drop<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.319> kids<00:04:09.530> to

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
itself and why not drop the kids to

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.780 
itself and why not drop the kids to
school<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.010> my<00:04:10.250> car

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
