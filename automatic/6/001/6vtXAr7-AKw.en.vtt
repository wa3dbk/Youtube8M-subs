00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 shoe the color of the hull of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 roads budget is a game 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 violent 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 finally nothing at all because here finally 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 seeing him yes because you want 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.579
 to tease the gaiter so here you go 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.990
 know that baby wipes all 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.630
 it's not really really good 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.439
 4 es salam sall and shine 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 Here we started like that we go 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.079
 all right who have shunned the test a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.079
 bad way enough we like that enough 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.920
 that I waited for that so it's 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.580
 this is the one way it lasts 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 not too long 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.360
 so here we go we will attack the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.100
 watch for me I'll do that this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.240
 part finally the inner part must there 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.020
 do you see that madrid 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.030
 so I'm going to stratum as a concern and 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 we will start so you take your 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.880
 waxing or wait until the that the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.620
 liquid from the margin is either dry 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 so I take paper so I have 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.400
 shown a little special 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.010
 normally there are just two small 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.250
 sponges embedded in it but in fact there 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.400
 is all disgusting as the decks thrown 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.770
 and it's all dry 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.420
 now I'm going to do with a 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.310
 paper but hey that's a lot more 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.570
 practice facts with a paper so 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.910
 in fact it's a kind of little ball 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.300
 green there we will actually end up on the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.240
 gaiter like this is so it's okay 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:24.330
 just throw some liquid and we're going 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:28.590
 apply with this balloon blake is so 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:32.130
 everywhere you can do it everywhere 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:37.940
 I want to do that here so here I am 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.470
 think you see well I hope so 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.090
 it's more fun than the town hall but 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:51.930
 really it's really hidden well 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:53.250
 started here so we'll wait until 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.560
 it's dry we can put a second 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.030
 layer 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.890
 so if you do not have too much to reduce 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.900
 and that you feel that enough is enough 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.000
 you stop the green apple years that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.640
 it's dry and that's so it gave a 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.940
 result 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.100
 so this is so me actually 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.350
 well it's not hiding face masks 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.390
 but in fact it is that I tear is 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.250
 because some of strokes 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.989
 but I do it with my gaiters 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.510
 wants and who loves you and it really works 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.730
 Too much too good to say that his m so 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.180
 So here I have spent a second 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.760
 layer 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.760
 we still see the same 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.540
 and we had to paper or not 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:49.250
 so it's not a very very good color 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.860
 this is valid to rub 3000 years 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.099
 but here it is it could rub a little 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.740
 long it's a loan of teeth 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:10.550
 we have sages is very quickly by 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:10.550
 month in two patients
