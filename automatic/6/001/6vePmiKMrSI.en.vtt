00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
um hi I'm Christy noticin and this is

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.010 
um hi I'm Christy noticin and this is
instructions<00:00:04.319> for<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> modular<00:00:06.020> stellated

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
instructions for a modular stellated

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.780 
instructions for a modular stellated
nonagon<00:00:07.910> and<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.660> need<00:00:09.870> nine<00:00:10.580> sheets<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
nonagon and you need nine sheets of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.189 
nonagon and you need nine sheets of
paper<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.679> use<00:00:13.679> three<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.309> each<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.020> I'm<00:00:16.020> going

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
paper I use three of each and I'm going

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160 
paper I use three of each and I'm going
to<00:00:16.289> show<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.859> module<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.330> take<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.779> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to show you one module you take it and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.490 
to show you one module you take it and
you<00:00:19.320> fold<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.740> half<00:00:19.770> our<00:00:20.160> text<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> vertex

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.620 

and<00:00:25.500> open<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> back<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.240> I'm<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> fold

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and open it back up I'm going to fold

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
and open it back up I'm going to fold
this<00:00:28.410> edge<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.800> meet<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> crease<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.920> I'm

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this edge to meet this crease and I'm

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.930 
this edge to meet this crease and I'm
going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> same<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.700> side

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
going to do the same thing on the side

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.060 
going to do the same thing on the side
right<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.380> think<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.860> called

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
right here so I have I think it's called

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.930 
right here so I have I think it's called
kite<00:00:38.340> base<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:42.079> your<00:00:43.079> step<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.940> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
kite base and that is your step one so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
kite base and that is your step one so
I've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> basic<00:00:45.510> kite<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:47.219> I'm

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I've got a basic kite right here now I'm

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.930 
I've got a basic kite right here now I'm
gonna<00:00:47.730> flip<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> over<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.730> starting<00:00:50.730> from

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
gonna flip it over and starting from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.170 
gonna flip it over and starting from
here<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.960> gonna<00:00:52.140> rotate<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:53.090> making<00:00:54.090> sure

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
here I'm gonna rotate this making sure

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.650 
here I'm gonna rotate this making sure
the<00:00:54.449> underside<00:00:54.960> stays<00:00:55.699> flat<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.149> I'm

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the underside stays flat with it I'm

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
the underside stays flat with it I'm
going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> rotate<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.920> meet<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.730> vertex

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
going to rotate this to meet this vertex

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
going to rotate this to meet this vertex
and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> crease<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and then I'm going to crease so I'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.340 
and then I'm going to crease so I'm
holding<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> ground<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:06.140> I'm<00:01:07.140> gonna

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
holding it on the ground and I'm gonna

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
holding it on the ground and I'm gonna
pinch<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pinch from here to here is where I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.649 
pinch from here to here is where I
crease<00:01:10.010> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> open<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.540> up

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
crease I'm going to get up open it up

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
crease I'm going to get up open it up
and<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:13.260> exact<00:01:13.740> thing<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:14.760> gonna

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and do the same exact thing I'm gonna

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320 
and do the same exact thing I'm gonna
rotate<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.040> fold<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> here

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
rotate this I'm gonna fold it up to here

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.649 
rotate this I'm gonna fold it up to here
and<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> crease<00:01:20.820> from<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and I'm going to crease from here to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
and I'm going to crease from here to
here<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:25.430> I've<00:01:26.430> got<00:01:26.460> paper<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.119> wants<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
here and I've got paper that wants to do

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.160 
here and I've got paper that wants to do
this<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.369> allow<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:31.920> flat

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
this so I'm gonna allow this to go flat

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
this so I'm gonna allow this to go flat
this<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> pocket<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.400> been<00:01:35.640> formed

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this is the pocket that's been formed

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.440 
this is the pocket that's been formed
now<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> fold<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.770> edge

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
now I'm going to fold this edge

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
now I'm going to fold this edge
approximately<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.930> leaving<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.770> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
approximately to here leaving a little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.499 
approximately to here leaving a little
bit<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> space<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.150> creates

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
bit of space that actually creates

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.380 
bit of space that actually creates
visible<00:01:43.399> some<00:01:44.399> visual<00:01:44.729> interest

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
visible some visual interest

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.050 
visible some visual interest
so<00:01:45.659> I've<00:01:46.220> folded<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so I've folded that now I'm going to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
so I've folded that now I'm going to
crease<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> open<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.369> up

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
crease this I'm going to open that up

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.270 
crease this I'm going to open that up
I'm<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> outside<00:01:51.810> reverse<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
I'm going to outside reverse it and that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.899 
I'm going to outside reverse it and that
would<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.049> basic<00:01:58.469> module<00:02:00.829> and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
would be it that is the basic module and

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.240 
would be it that is the basic module and
here's<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.119> assemble<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:04.040> just<00:02:05.040> take

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
here's how you assemble them just take

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
here's how you assemble them just take
this<00:02:05.399> apart<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.149> actually<00:02:06.390> see

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

this<00:02:10.690> little<00:02:10.899> short<00:02:11.140> parts<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> outside

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
this little short parts on the outside

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.320 
this little short parts on the outside
I'm<00:02:12.400> going<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.670> tuck<00:02:13.410> into<00:02:14.410> here<00:02:15.070> goes<00:02:16.030> this

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I'm going to tuck into here goes this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.370 
I'm going to tuck into here goes this
and<00:02:16.660> into<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.530> goes<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:22.170> I'm<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.350> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and into here goes this so I'm going to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.310 
and into here goes this so I'm going to
slide<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:27.700> far<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.150> goes<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.290> I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
slide it in as far as it goes and then I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.310 
slide it in as far as it goes and then I
simply<00:02:29.650> do<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.130> next<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.900> I'm<00:02:31.900> going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.140> take

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
simply do the next one I'm going to take

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.820 
simply do the next one I'm going to take
these<00:02:32.920> two<00:02:32.980> points<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.140> right<00:02:35.350> here<00:02:35.410> right

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
