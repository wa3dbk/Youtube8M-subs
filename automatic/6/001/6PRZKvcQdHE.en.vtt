you know I'm trying to maximize the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.240 
you know I'm trying to maximize the
equipment<00:02:08.090> here<00:02:08.390> there's<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.349> that

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
equipment here there's not really that

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.199 
equipment here there's not really that
much<00:02:10.959> out<00:02:11.959> there<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.920> has<00:02:13.130> larger<00:02:13.880> scale

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
much out there that has larger scale

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.900 
much out there that has larger scale
equipment<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.500> these<00:02:15.770> forms<00:02:16.190> I'd<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.730> see

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
equipment so these forms I'd like to see

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.050 
equipment so these forms I'd like to see
them<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.480> kind<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:19.280> know<00:02:19.370> overhead

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
them you know kind of you know overhead

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.870 
them you know kind of you know overhead
and<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:21.110> large<00:02:21.500> compared<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.819> know

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
and pretty large compared to you know

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
and pretty large compared to you know
human<00:02:23.300> scale<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:29.090> able<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.330> get<00:02:29.569> them<00:02:29.750> as

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
human scale so to be able to get them as

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780 
human scale so to be able to get them as
big<00:02:30.140> as<00:02:30.260> possible<00:02:30.500> we're<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.640> in

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
big as possible we're going to do it in

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.809 
big as possible we're going to do it in
parts<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.110> stem<00:02:33.440> would<00:02:33.830> be<00:02:34.010> one<00:02:34.190> part<00:02:34.519> in

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
parts so the stem would be one part in

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.780 
parts so the stem would be one part in
the<00:02:35.569> top<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.290> center<00:02:36.769> with<00:02:37.400> these<00:02:37.580> little

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the top and center with these little

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.229 
the top and center with these little
sepals<00:02:38.390> would<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.900> another<00:02:39.170> part<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.709> then

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
sepals would be another part and then

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.000 
sepals would be another part and then
multiples<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.600> kind<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.049> these<00:02:42.200> petal<00:02:42.650> forms

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
multiples of kind of these petal forms

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.289 
multiples of kind of these petal forms
would<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.370> another<00:02:43.580> part<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.150> they'll

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
would be another part and then they'll

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.910 
would be another part and then they'll
be<00:02:44.420> assembled<00:02:44.930> cold<00:02:47.380> glassblowing<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
be assembled cold glassblowing as a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.059 
be assembled cold glassblowing as a
process<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:50.390> me<00:02:50.569> in<00:02:50.930> my<00:02:51.170> work<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.830> lot

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
process for me in my work you know a lot

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.490 
process for me in my work you know a lot
of<00:02:52.100> times<00:02:52.400> I'm<00:02:52.580> breaking<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.030> down<00:02:53.180> into

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
of times I'm breaking it down into

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.150 
of times I'm breaking it down into
components<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.650> then<00:02:54.739> assembling

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
components and then assembling

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.789 
components and then assembling
components<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.510> separate<00:02:57.049> teams<00:02:57.319> each

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
components to have separate teams each

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.000 
components to have separate teams each
working<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.370> different<00:02:58.519> parts<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.269> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
working on different parts of the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.460 
working on different parts of the
finished<00:03:01.010> piece<00:03:01.690> really<00:03:02.690> makes<00:03:02.900> sense<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.410> a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
finished piece really makes sense in a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.170 
finished piece really makes sense in a
process<00:03:04.040> way

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.640 

generally<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:11.040> work<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.819> torch<00:03:12.150> by<00:03:12.630> myself<00:03:13.110> so

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
generally I work on a torch by myself so

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
generally I work on a torch by myself so
it's<00:03:13.830> nice<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.069> get<00:03:14.490> into<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> different

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
it's nice to get into a different

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.470 
it's nice to get into a different
environment<00:03:15.709> where<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.370> know<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.490> can<00:03:17.850> create

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
environment where you know I can create

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.559 
environment where you know I can create
things<00:03:18.780> more<00:03:19.230> quickly<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:20.010> work<00:03:20.819> with<00:03:21.150> other
