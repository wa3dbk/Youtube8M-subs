alright<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:00.989> here<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.439> kind<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
alright so this here is kind of the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.679 
alright so this here is kind of the
completion<00:00:02.370> of<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.550> programming<00:00:02.970> aspect<00:00:03.210> of

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
completion of the programming aspect of

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.889 
completion of the programming aspect of
this<00:00:03.780> project<00:00:04.790> this<00:00:05.790> screen<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.450> controlling

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
this project this screen is controlling

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.500 
this project this screen is controlling
these<00:00:06.990> two<00:00:07.170> servo<00:00:07.560> motors<00:00:08.030> which<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.210> going

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
these two servo motors which are going

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650 
these two servo motors which are going
to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.719> controlling<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:11.059> level<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.090> light<00:00:12.389> on

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
to be controlling the level of light on

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.890 
to be controlling the level of light on
a<00:00:12.690> fish<00:00:13.019> tank<00:00:13.200> aquarium<00:00:13.320> light<00:00:14.630> so<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.870> now

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a fish tank aquarium light so right now

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.519 
a fish tank aquarium light so right now
we<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.470> both<00:00:17.430> blue<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.760> white<00:00:18.180> LED<00:00:18.690> levels

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
we have both blue and white LED levels

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.410 
we have both blue and white LED levels
this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.520> actual<00:00:20.880> level<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this is going to be our actual level and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.170 
this is going to be our actual level and
this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.500> desired<00:00:22.920> level<00:00:23.369> so

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
this is going to be our desired level so

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.660 
this is going to be our desired level so
we<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.570> either<00:00:24.720> manually<00:00:25.439> enter<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.430> we

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we can either manually enter in if we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060 
we can either manually enter in if we
want<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> go<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> full<00:00:27.689> light<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.949> could

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
want it to go to full light you could

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.519 
want it to go to full light you could
enter<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.580> value<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> see

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
enter in the value and as you can see

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590 
enter in the value and as you can see
the<00:00:31.890> our<00:00:32.309> desired<00:00:32.700> value<00:00:33.059> jumped<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.570> up

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the our desired value jumped right up

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.400 
the our desired value jumped right up
and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.350> servo<00:00:34.559> motor<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.190> stepping

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
and the servo motor is now stepping

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
and the servo motor is now stepping
approaching<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.890> value<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.489> wanted<00:00:39.480> so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
approaching the value that we wanted so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.889 
approaching the value that we wanted so
these<00:00:40.110> circles<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.860> coupled<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
these circles are going to be coupled to

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
these circles are going to be coupled to
light<00:00:42.899> control<00:00:43.290> knobs<00:00:43.530> yeah<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> aquarium

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
light control knobs yeah the aquarium

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
light control knobs yeah the aquarium
visa<00:00:45.120> connect<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> physical<00:00:46.710> knob

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
visa connect to do a physical knob

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
visa connect to do a physical knob
that's<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.780> basically

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that's basically just basically

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.310 
that's basically just basically
replacing<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> manual<00:00:50.910> operator<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.809> turning

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
replacing a manual operator at turning

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840 
replacing a manual operator at turning
the<00:00:52.410> knob<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.039> didn't<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> cut<00:00:53.730> into

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the knob so you didn't want to cut into

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
the knob so you didn't want to cut into
the<00:00:54.090> original<00:00:54.510> circuitry<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> aquarium

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the original circuitry of the aquarium

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
the original circuitry of the aquarium
light<00:00:55.890> control<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.899> mechanically

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
light control so we're mechanically

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
light control so we're mechanically
adjusting<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> existing<00:00:59.039> knobs<00:00:59.280> yes<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> PLC

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
adjusting the existing knobs yes the PLC

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
adjusting the existing knobs yes the PLC
cool<00:01:01.050> seemed<00:01:01.530> preferable<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.670> know

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
cool seemed preferable to you know

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
cool seemed preferable to you know
voiding<00:01:03.239> any<00:01:03.359> warranty<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> light<00:01:04.290> since

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
voiding any warranty for the light since

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
voiding any warranty for the light since
they<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.799> quite<00:01:05.040> expensive<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
they are quite expensive right now this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
they are quite expensive right now this
makes<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:07.049> convenient<00:01:07.590> okay<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
makes it a lot more convenient okay I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
makes it a lot more convenient okay I
see<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> home<00:01:09.240> button<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.170> does

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
see a home button right here what does

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
see a home button right here what does
that<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.820> pushing<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> home<00:01:12.090> button

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that do pushing the home button

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
that do pushing the home button
basically<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.170> assures<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.770> both<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
basically just assures that both of the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
basically just assures that both of the
servo<00:01:15.150> motors<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.320> their

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
servo motors are all the way at their

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.520 
servo motors are all the way at their
lowest<00:01:16.680> position<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> refresh

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
lowest position just to kind of refresh

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
lowest position just to kind of refresh
it<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.920> make<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.390> program<00:01:22.290> knows<00:01:22.619> what

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it and make sure the program knows what

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.350 
it and make sure the program knows what
count<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.000> hit<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> home

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
count it's at so if I hit the home

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.649 
count it's at so if I hit the home
button<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.979> quickly<00:01:26.430> move<00:01:27.270> each

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
button it's going to quickly move each

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
button it's going to quickly move each
servo<00:01:27.960> motor<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.470> far<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> moves<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
servo motor as far as it moves in that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
servo motor as far as it moves in that
direction<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.079> reset<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> setpoint<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
direction and reset all the setpoint and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.600 
direction and reset all the setpoint and
count<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.659> okay<00:01:33.990> yeah<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> PLC

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
count about okay yeah because the PLC

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
count about okay yeah because the PLC
doesn't<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.270> absolute<00:01:36.960> reference<00:01:37.439> for

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
doesn't have any absolute reference for

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.740 
doesn't have any absolute reference for
knob<00:01:38.009> position<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.299> knows<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.509> many

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
knob position it just knows how many

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
knob position it just knows how many
pulses<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.500> sent<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.030> servos<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
pulses that sent to the servos to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
pulses that sent to the servos to
increment<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.689> decrement<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
increment or decrement so you have to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.370 
increment or decrement so you have to
give<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> home<00:01:44.880> position<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> drives

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
give it a home position so it drives

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
give it a home position so it drives
everything<00:01:46.680> fully<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.310> direction<00:01:47.729> calls

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
everything fully one direction calls

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.649 
everything fully one direction calls
that<00:01:48.210> zero<00:01:48.479> yep<00:01:48.920> cool<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.479> about

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that zero yep cool and then what about
