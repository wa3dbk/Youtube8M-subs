00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hello friends Youtube 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.600
 Welcome to this channel 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.900
 Today I will show you how to patch 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.599
 a net or just throw 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.000
 as we see here 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 a huge gap 

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:26.600
 and that we continue to improve 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 let this cut 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.400
 for it no longer serves us 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.700
 and now take our needle 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 always with a matching thread 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.500
 join us now with the Splice connection 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 I already have you in a previous video 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:51.899
 the Splice connection 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 throw 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.299
 cut now 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 we know this node is running 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.500
 Now we take the diamond 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 Where's the knot, 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 for the eye in what 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600
 We will make another node 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.600
 the next round as well 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We fit and now another weather button, 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.000
 but in the bottom 

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:46.399
 such that the knot 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.299
 the original tissue we leave in the middle 

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:50.299
 cut now 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.299
 and we got there 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 the diamond where we will make another knot 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 it will cut friends 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.699
 and we run 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 around the knot 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 at the bottom 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 Well ... then we cut 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 and now we will run 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.299
 so we will be knotless 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.799
 and we will make the next knot there 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 Now here we unite our thread 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 always with the Splice connection 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.900
 We bind here 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.399
 now we have tied the other side too 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400
 with a blind knot 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.900
 And now, let's throw to adjust 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.899
 well now 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.800
 continue to cut 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 so we have a good one 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 and in the end we cut 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 We grab the diamond 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.799
 We measure and do the knot 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.599
 the knot we weave normally 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.900
 the atarraya 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.200
 this is the knot we do 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.500
 Now the bottom 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.500
 that just runs 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900
 We take it with needle 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.900
 and the knot is the same as we weave 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.599
 the atarraya just this time 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.600
 This is the reverse 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.599
 We take the two wires and now 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.600
 each other in the middle of the two 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.500
 as you can see ... and right now 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 right 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.500
 as soon as you 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.500
 We give a custom 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.699
 and now we just have this diamond 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.699
 We pass the needle 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.700
 We were right 

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.199
 in this way we will be equal 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.199
 now we give a pass rate 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.199
 and one in the middle of the two wires 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.200
 and we will change 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.699
 fit well 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.399
 now we just need to 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.399
 last 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800
 and make the knot 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.500
 I got you in a previous video 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 it's the "knot to plaster" 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.399
 We catch estimate 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.799
 and we got through the two wires 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.500
 Only then 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.599
 then make blind button 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 such that the knot 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.900
 original tissue we leave in the middle 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.200
 right? 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.400
 well suited and us now 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.599
 we continue to cut 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.899
 Remember friends 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:01.399
 to network round patch 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.399
 They provide Mend 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.699
 same color thread 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.500
 your network can be green 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 patch with a green thread 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.199
 If it is white as in this case me 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:15.500
 I patch with white wire 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500
 good friends 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 If they like the video share it 

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.699
 and write 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.699
 me 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.000
 to the next 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 chaooo
