00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.280 
earning experience and changing what's
going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> happen<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.659> our<00:01:48.810> character<00:01:49.049> from

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
going to happen with our character from

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.600 
going to happen with our character from
the<00:01:49.409> beginning<00:01:49.740> any<00:01:49.860> game<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> end<00:01:50.310> how

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the beginning any game to the end how

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.780 
the beginning any game to the end how
how<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.600> expand<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> grow<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.280> far

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
how much can we expand and grow so far

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
how much can we expand and grow so far
we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> system<00:01:54.840> called<00:01:55.110> persistent

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
we have a system called persistent

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
we have a system called persistent
character<00:01:56.310> progression<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.479> allows<00:01:57.750> us

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
character progression and that allows us

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
character progression and that allows us
to<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.320> our<00:01:58.500> character<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.610> offline

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to take our character from an offline

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
to take our character from an offline
game<00:02:00.270> into<00:02:00.659> an<00:02:00.750> online<00:02:01.110> game<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.680> back

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
game into an online game and then back

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.120 
game into an online game and then back
again<00:02:02.070> without<00:02:02.610> interrupting<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.479> story

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
again without interrupting the story

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.130 
again without interrupting the story
so<00:02:04.399> wherever<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.939> go<00:02:05.329> into<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.689> online<00:02:05.960> game

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
so wherever you go into the online game

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.330 
so wherever you go into the online game
you'll<00:02:06.320> basically<00:02:06.469> come<00:02:06.829> back<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.159> you'll<00:02:07.250> be

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you'll basically come back and you'll be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.100 
you'll basically come back and you'll be
straight<00:02:07.579> on<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.030> offline<00:02:08.599> game<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:08.989> you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
straight on to the offline game as you

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.050 
straight on to the offline game as you
left<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> story<00:02:09.800> mode<00:02:10.009> your<00:02:10.640> character

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
about the ground zero level which was

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.839 
about the ground zero level which was
life<00:02:44.660> cycle<00:02:45.049> action<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.950> ground<00:02:46.250> zero<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.819> a

was<00:02:57.260> 90<00:02:57.680> degree<00:02:58.010> turns<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> norm<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
was 90 degree turns where the norm the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.660 
was 90 degree turns where the norm the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
new light cycles have a much more

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
means that you can do much wider

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.880 
means that you can do much wider
sweeping<00:03:05.810> arc<00:03:05.989> turns<00:03:06.319> when<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.680> lay<00:03:06.860> down

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
your light trail it also means if you go

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.110 
your light trail it also means if you go
uphill<00:03:09.170> your<00:03:09.620> light<00:03:09.769> cycles<00:03:10.280> slows<00:03:10.700> down<00:03:10.910> if

uphill your light cycles slows down if

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
uphill your light cycles slows down if
you<00:03:11.209> go<00:03:11.359> downhill<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.959> speeds<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.799> you've

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
you go downhill it speeds up and you've
