any screenwriters run into is just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
any screenwriters run into is just
feeling<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> blindly<00:01:00.120> guess

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420

made<00:06:30.520> to<00:06:30.610> fruition<00:06:30.820> it's<00:06:31.150> just<00:06:31.300> people

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
made to fruition it's just people

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.920
