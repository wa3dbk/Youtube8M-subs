00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 they have been waiting for this car for a long time 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.140
 Opel says that about his cascada 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 every case had the manufacturer 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.269
 in vain for the success of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.540
 predecessor astra twin top serviced the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 cascada should do better now 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 he is not conspicuous but 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 elegant on coastal roads so it is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.850
 not to attract attention 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.320
 but uncomplicated and free airflow 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 to enjoy the sun 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.240
 in the interior opel relies on proven 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.110
 design of the cascada is through and through 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.280
 a pleasing companion for propulsion 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 in the cascade 16 sed smooth 200 ps 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 standard consumption 6.7 liters up to 235 km h 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.030
 he is fast and from 29 1490 euros too 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.030
 to have 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.170
 The car carries a rather long name 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.180
 opel cascada 1.6 turbo she and she stands 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 but not for the little sister of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 cit the vt from ice age but serie 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.560
 stands for spark ignition direct 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.490
 injection this is new engine family 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.740
 from opel 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 four cylinders 1 6 liters and there is now 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.110
 which is the strongest unit with 200 ps 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.600
 So again 30 ps more than the 1.6 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.470
 liter turbo has achieved so far that we 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 now the same time more outgoing and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.630
 accelerate 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 Yes 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.649
 you can tell there is power there but 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.950
 this force bounces off 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.500
 about 1 7 tons group cascada and the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 slows down the dynamic flow something 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 no problem with 200 ps comes 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.060
 really everyone can handle but you are allowed 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.310
 now no momentum was the high weight 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 despite fabric cap comes among other things 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 through supplies deck mechanism 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.659
 we are now in opel cascada the 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.880
 open roof what is up to 30 km / h 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.270
 today is a little fresh moment 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.720
 breeze but you sit nice outdoors 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.399
 Well, except for completion of the sitting 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.509
 but a bit tight on the forehead though 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.250
 Otherwise, drive wonderful cars open 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.349
 By the way, the roof will open when you open it 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.400
 to two meters 10 in the height 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.569
 so be careful in the underground car park now 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.819
 we do that but then again at 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.769
 single-digit temperatures is not 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.250
 really open a big joy too 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.900
 drive 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.480
 except man thick packed love 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.930
 ski vacation the roof comes back again 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.930
 write up 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.490
 We do not want a cold anymore 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.490
 By the way, opening and closing happens 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.130
 in 17 and 19 seconds 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.180
 If desired, there is the cloth cap with extra 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.670
 Noise reduction in consumption is the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.010
 cascada at least according to the factory specification but 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.320
 no swallow 6 7 liters per 100 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.850
 kilometers are loud relative to the car 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.680
 lower value you have to in the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.310
 Reality still two liters on it pack 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.310
 and then it fits 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.409
 the squad is with the new 200 hp engine 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.060
 not an ultra dynamic traveler though 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.060
 a fair offer in its class
