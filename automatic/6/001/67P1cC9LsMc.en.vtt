of simplicity this video is only about

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.400 
of simplicity this video is only about
my<00:01:12.580> $400<00:01:13.420> version<00:01:13.899> if<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.080> go<00:01:14.200> any<00:01:14.380> higher

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
my $400 version if you go any higher

my $400 version if you go any higher
than<00:01:14.800> that

than that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.320 
than that
it's<00:01:15.430> really<00:01:15.640> not<00:01:15.789> going<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:15.970> be<00:01:16.060> worth<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
it's really not going to be worth the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.120 
it's really not going to be worth the
money<00:01:16.539> because<00:01:16.990> they<00:01:17.170> actually<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
money because they actually have the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.190 
money because they actually have the
same<00:01:18.430> exact<00:01:18.820> functionality<00:01:19.360> no<00:01:19.869> matter<00:01:20.020> which

get<00:01:22.119> asked<00:01:22.420> about<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.229> most<00:01:23.410> common

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
get asked about it and the most common

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.859 
get asked about it and the most common
question<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.640> what<00:01:24.789> does<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.060> do<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.509> the

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
question is so what does it do and the

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.900 
question is so what does it do and the
answer<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.259> that<00:01:26.289> is<00:01:26.619> way<00:01:26.950> too<00:01:27.009> much<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.759> feel

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
answer to that is way too much if I feel

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.370 
answer to that is way too much if I feel
like<00:01:28.030> impressing<00:01:28.479> whoever<00:01:28.750> asked<00:01:28.959> me<00:01:29.140> about

show<00:01:37.899> them<00:01:38.080> how<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:38.440> control<00:01:38.770> my

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
show them how I can control my

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.710 
show them how I can control my
soundcloud<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.429> my<00:01:39.700> watch<00:01:39.880> but<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.420> really

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
soundcloud on my watch but I really

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600 
soundcloud on my watch but I really
never<00:01:40.899> use<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.500> real<00:01:41.679> situation<00:01:41.890> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
never use that in a real situation and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.040 
never use that in a real situation and
then<00:01:42.849> sometimes<00:01:43.479> I'll<00:01:43.630> show<00:01:43.750> them<00:01:43.929> the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
then sometimes I'll show them the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.020 
then sometimes I'll show them the
Twitter<00:01:44.259> or<00:01:44.440> messages<00:01:44.860> app<00:01:45.039> but<00:01:45.459> once<00:01:45.729> again<00:01:45.880> I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
Twitter or messages app but once again I

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.790 
Twitter or messages app but once again I
never<00:01:46.179> use<00:01:46.599> that<00:01:46.630> other<00:01:47.020> than<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.440> show<00:01:47.470> people

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
never use that other than to show people

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100 
never use that other than to show people

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
you see a theme here it's much easier to

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.480 
you see a theme here it's much easier to
just<00:01:50.289> ask<00:01:50.410> somebody<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.800> take<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.069> picture<00:01:51.369> of

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
just ask somebody to take a picture of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.029 
just ask somebody to take a picture of
me<00:01:51.789> instead<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.209> using<00:01:52.539> my<00:01:52.690> watch<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.289> do<00:01:53.440> it

with Twitter and messages it's much

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
faster just to whip out your phone and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.900 
faster just to whip out your phone and

so<00:02:04.569> what<00:02:04.720> do<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.080> use<00:02:05.410> my<00:02:05.440> Apple<00:02:05.920> watch<00:02:05.950> for

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
so what do I use my Apple watch for

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.880 
so what do I use my Apple watch for
simply<00:02:07.149> put<00:02:07.330> glanceable<00:02:07.869> information<00:02:07.929> when<00:02:08.860> I

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
simply put glanceable information when I

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
simply put glanceable information when I
use<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.280> I'm<00:02:09.429> lifting<00:02:09.729> my<00:02:09.849> wrist<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.149> check<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
use it I'm lifting my wrist to check the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
use it I'm lifting my wrist to check the
time<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.020> check<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> weather<00:02:11.470> or<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.099> check<00:02:12.280> a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
time to check the weather or to check a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.130 
time to check the weather or to check a
notification<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.270> that's<00:02:13.569> about<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.810> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
notification and that's about it and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.260 
notification and that's about it and
that<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.560> why<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.739> Apple<00:02:15.130> watch<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.520> not<00:02:15.790> worth

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
that is why the Apple watch is not worth

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.330 
that is why the Apple watch is not worth
buying<00:02:16.750> Apple<00:02:17.290> give<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.560> Apple<00:02:17.830> watch<00:02:17.920> way

buying Apple give the Apple watch way

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
buying Apple give the Apple watch way
too<00:02:18.370> much<00:02:18.790> functionality<00:02:19.360> wearable

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
too much functionality wearable

all<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.880> function<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> Apple<00:02:25.720> watch

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
all the function that the Apple watch

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.470 
all the function that the Apple watch
has<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:26.739> useful<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:27.819> there's<00:02:28.030> no<00:02:28.180> real

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
point including it if it's just easier

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.220

or faster to use my phone anyway I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.420 
or faster to use my phone anyway I
wouldn't<00:02:32.500> really<00:02:32.650> say<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.040> Apple<00:02:33.310> watch

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
wouldn't really say the Apple watch

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.039 
wouldn't really say the Apple watch
costs<00:02:33.939> too<00:02:34.090> much<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.480> careful<00:02:34.870> not<00:02:34.900> to

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
costs too much and I was careful not to

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.690 
costs too much and I was careful not to
say<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.439> throughout<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.860> video<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.459> would

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
say that throughout this video I would

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.740 
say that throughout this video I would
say<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.180> does

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
say it does

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.390 
say it does
too<00:02:37.960> much<00:02:38.140> Apple<00:02:38.530> needs<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.770> simplify<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
too much Apple needs to simplify the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.250 
too much Apple needs to simplify the
functionality<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.360> focus<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.020> quick

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
functionality and focus on quick

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.230 
functionality and focus on quick
glanceable<00:02:41.710> information<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.520> naturally<00:02:43.210> a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
glanceable information and naturally a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.120 
glanceable information and naturally a
watch<00:02:43.600> with<00:02:43.870> less<00:02:44.080> functionality<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.950> more

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
watch with less functionality and a more

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.580 
watch with less functionality and a more
simple<00:02:45.520> watch<00:02:45.670> will<00:02:45.970> cost<00:02:46.240> less<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.260> year

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
simple watch will cost less so this year

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.860 
simple watch will cost less so this year
I<00:02:47.770> wouldn't<00:02:48.430> buy<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.030> next<00:02:49.240> year<00:02:49.390> next

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
I wouldn't buy it but next year next

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.600 
I wouldn't buy it but next year next
year<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.380> they<00:02:50.530> really<00:02:50.770> focus<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.400> on

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
year if they really focus it in on

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.640 
year if they really focus it in on
glanceable<00:02:52.000> information<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.140> point<00:02:53.440> of

glanceable information and the point of
wearable<00:02:53.980> technology<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:55.209> could<00:02:55.360> be
