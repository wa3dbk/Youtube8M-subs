00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
have a smaller hitbox creepers can now

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.620 
have a smaller hitbox creepers can now
be<00:01:14.729> ignited<00:01:15.270> again<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> let's<00:01:16.950> try<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.340> out

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.850 

mmm<00:01:27.650> that's<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.830> working<00:01:29.960> says<00:01:30.960> creepers<00:01:31.590> can

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
mmm that's not working says creepers can

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640 
mmm that's not working says creepers can
now<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.280> ignited<00:01:32.700> again<00:01:32.940> maybe<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.720> maybe<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
now be ignited again maybe and maybe in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.630 
now be ignited again maybe and maybe in
a<00:01:35.060> survival<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.780> creative<00:01:37.640> extended

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a survival but not creative extended

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.540 
a survival but not creative extended
seem<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:38.940> working<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:41.010> maybe<00:01:41.190> just<00:01:41.430> in

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
seem to be working so maybe just in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.300 
seem to be working so maybe just in
survival<00:01:42.090> mode<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:43.650> fixed<00:01:44.010> babe

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
survival mode and they fixed babe

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
survival mode and they fixed babe
particles<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> guess<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:45.900> you<00:01:45.960> break<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
particles so I guess when you break it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
particles so I guess when you break it
up<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.590> doesn't<00:01:46.710> look<00:01:46.980> wrong<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> fixed

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
up it doesn't look wrong also the fixed

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
up it doesn't look wrong also the fixed
explosions<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:49.830> multiplayer<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.280> can't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
explosions and multiplayer I can't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.040 
explosions and multiplayer I can't
demonstrate<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.510> because<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.870> don't

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
demonstrate that to you because I don't

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.200 
demonstrate that to you because I don't
have<00:01:52.230> anybody<00:01:52.440> play<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.160> doors<00:01:53.910> are<00:01:54.060> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
particles too so let's go ahead and try

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.300
