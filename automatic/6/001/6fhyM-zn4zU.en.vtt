 Click there so here you start 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.299
 asked by the way cho for garbage that's it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 is it to be painted the other part of the hand 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.250
 and the hands they are painted the same that is, we 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.959
 we can ask him about this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.790

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.209

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.459
 not so but the same principle and the other on 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.650
 you remove this part of the body draw here 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.310
 back and and put on the legs too by the way 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.370
 drawn together all so we put 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.299
 torso and everything and if on the trunk we want 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.430
 we remove the head we can put 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.129
 back head remove hands and we can 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.340
 In general, this is how to do that here purely 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:00.049
 torso painted on personally piece by piece 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:05.290
