know if it'll be a good game or not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.620

killstreaks<00:04:08.449> I<00:04:08.569> think<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:09.019> should<00:04:09.199> be<00:04:09.379> a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
killstreaks I think this should be a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.800 
killstreaks I think this should be a
personal<00:04:10.340> kill<00:04:10.549> streak<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.150> honest<00:04:11.629> I
