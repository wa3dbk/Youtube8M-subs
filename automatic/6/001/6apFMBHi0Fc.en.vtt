00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.799
 Good people, I'll explain to you today. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.040
 how do you record the system how is it 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 makes the tb 27 system near the time of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 today I really like this system 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 they were to restore some 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.320
 applications that give an error or a part 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.539
 in case of the operation that you place 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.740
 so I went in later forget until 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.859
 then he takes good use of the card is all 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.050
 the micro sd card it has a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.750
 it has a paste that the part of the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.279
 recovery of the device but at first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.880
 What are you going to do? 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.649
 button and the menu button next to the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 least until he is active in the case 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.700
 time red 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 Good, he'll get in that way. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 activated when it appeared there you 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.600
 Piece or less again 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.000
 good after it shows up on the small screen now 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.890
 of representation you are going to put the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.890
 Micro SD hence in the case of the apparatus 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.050
 What you put in the micro room you go 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.730
 see that in the case thus has the apple obeidi 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.740
 for mole 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.480
 a ipo what since there is such a focus of reset 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.620
 sure you can in case the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.570
 first option 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.690
 case to confirm that you press the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.400
 Too many buttons are too good on him. 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.640
 learn the directory where you have a 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.320
 I'll squeeze again, I'll go again. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.320
 download far as having his guti is 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.780
 O good here is like recovery even in 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.780
 I remember the part 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.200
 or he coming back with the initial theme here 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.330
 you will put here O father pity 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 factory reserve is and gives a squeeze more 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.270
 new iphone had so excellent to use 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.040
 you will download the menu button 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.340
 serve until it tightens a little more 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.340
 affirmed 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 he started to format when 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 it says the format was complete 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.390
 It's just you, in case the press is here. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.390
 below the figueirense 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.650
 now he is installing aa 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.750
 applications is where it's going to be until 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.910
 saying that whoever got the karton is 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.940
 installing everything you was in 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.760
 question card again that it is the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.260
 his operating system he was in 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.260
 around how to do this 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.040
 I think he keeps reading what 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.849
 If he hangs it up here for the wall to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.849
 you try again 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.319
 Good, we have to wait, even he is. 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.330
 Why did you live, let's go? 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.550
 many applications many participations 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.550
 expected to make the format is 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.960
 remembering that this type of system does not 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.580
 It's for power that does not bind so much. 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.170
 because it usually uses pressed and not 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.770
 can be even if the problem of 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.770
 nand flash memory 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.690
 ok it 's now at the end we're already 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.730
 join it when it's over it goes 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.830
 appears here has been installed completely 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.630
 What did you have when you see there? 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.460
 he will come back the first one that ruth 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.530
 exist or will confirm that you do not 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.560
 want the system again by pressing the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.650
 Cycle May on 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.210
 was when he will restart the device 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.900
 starting device it will already have 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.420
 installed the other apps right 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.150
 probably the igor gps part will 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.400
 ter is uninstalled utah is only you enter 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.230
 where the fae says is a small table and 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.480
 search for where apache is in 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.370
 Sunday within the party and returned to 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.770
 sin that the application does not only take place in 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.860
 talk to him and will again be 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.630
 reinstalled the same person I hope 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.630
