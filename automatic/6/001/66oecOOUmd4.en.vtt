00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 and would keep the base a bit what 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 would play with a 4-3-1-2 that has kept 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 sampaoli in all this period of time 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 I really like what he has done and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.960
 Mena by the bands even though 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.449
 some way I think we still have 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 to improve a lot in defense I think 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.650
 than in a world championship where 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 there are only three parties we do not have 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 enough time to recover 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.650
 to recover from mistakes and I 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.360
 I think that there where a little 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.820
 maybe it 's that you keep a little bit the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.010
 balance with what is chile de 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.740
 defense forward and I think there 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.920
 we mark the differences with a vidal 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.040
 with marcelo dÃ­az with the same charles 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.880
 spider that I like a lot as as as 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.130
 is combined with the team and from there to 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.340
 up that will say by com valdivia 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.950
 sanchez and vargas that have been the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.990
 pillars of these last parties and it 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.460
 They have thrown the equipment on me 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.810
 fantastic is likely to be many 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 changes what we have seen in these 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.409
 I do not think it 's more 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.509
 I think but you know that in football 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.979
 As you have described it, I will pass it on 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.750
 anything are these lessons there 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.719
 a lot of things that can happen 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.479
 that in the end one can do many 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.009
 things now but but at the time of being 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.109
 near the world cup can change many 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.849
 things and they go and how much hunter to play 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.319
 favor of this second participation 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.079
 consecutive second consecutive of the 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.759
 selection the fact that it is justly 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.079
 the second the second chance that 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.240
 they have players who already have the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.099
 experience that went on the court in a 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.709
 world soccer championship sometimes the 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:48.289
 experience serves charge I think that 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.649
 have that maturity to be able to 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.409
 play a second world this to the 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.920
 ability to face it or another 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.530
 way us when we get to the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 world of France 98 I told them that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.359
 that was our first world cup to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.229
 all but we had to play it like 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.369
 if it were the last World Cup and we did not have 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.019
 austin one of that did not touch us the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.269
 opportunity to play the world offered us 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.580
 an old lady but today I think that this 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.740
 generation has had the opportunity to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.540
 of coming to an upcoming World Cup and I think 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.470
 that experiences help a lot 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.470
 make things better
