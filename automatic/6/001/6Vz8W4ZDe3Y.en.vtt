00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.670
 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.390
 to play the song between you and me of the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.570
 series of violets 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.200
 I would start against the agreed very easy 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.200
 it would be the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.700
 to me 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 re 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.790
 and the new mind 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.910
 and the regio would be like that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 no no no no 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 Y 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 no no 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 no no 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 good 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
 when making the notes if they did not give 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 account there are some small accompaniments 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.930
 that would be in the note the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 and in the note 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.180
 it would be like this the intro 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.470
 i 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.470
 do not 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.440
 do not 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.860
 all right 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
 no no 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.750
 in the stanza when you're singing 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.980
 the notes would be the same but 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.270
 I would change what 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.420
 at the time of doing so 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.930
 it would be in the stanza 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.990
 or not 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.829
 ah 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 no no no 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.400
 and that repeats good to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.240
 when doing the choir 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.430
 when I start singing with the girl 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.990
 the chords had the same and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.600
 They change the way of doing the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.170
 accompaniments 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.170
 it would be 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 Y 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.640
 all right 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.150
 that is, it would give exactly like 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.670
 ribbon 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.769
 well this is mainly the song 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.470
 and if you want to do it in 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.560
 sustained would be with the following 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 notes 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.970
 would be with a tie obtained 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.610
 that would be doing a fa in the fifth 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.610
 space 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.910
 in me it would be like yes but in 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.910
 the seventh space 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.890
 and re the same but run it is not easy 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.200
 - in the fifth space 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 that would be man and that would be 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.840
 or 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.389
 or not 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.710
 and well you are doing the 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.520
 corresponding accompaniments 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.740
 and they would have the song 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.310
 I wish you liked my video and
