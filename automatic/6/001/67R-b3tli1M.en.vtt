00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 bny find here the video showed you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.180
 the tutorial on how to make the wave of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.650
 mikati, this is the one I've done 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.910
 video showing then let's tutorial 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.949
 I came back then you will need a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.310
 repeater head story 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.310
 mikati and the rail that passes energy 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 so come on 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.250
 first before you start think 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.120
 he must then also leverage 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.780
 First let's put our 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 lever that will connect our system is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 put a repeater there 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:17.250
 here two here three here 4 ac 5 ac 6 ac 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:22.670
 7 ac and 8 here all with a delay after 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.670
 Let's put one here with law 4 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.720
 Let's put that here or here too. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 with four of law we will also start 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.900
 one here two here 23 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.540
 This is where I put it, it 's good. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 here four of them in the same direction 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:59.939
 said four and here is hot but 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:02:07.290
 You give me up to 8 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 18 that will 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:08.759
 do the same thing it a ak-47 day 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.800
 on here 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.790
 and so you will continue to do until 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 Finally, I do not know if this 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.650
 word is to put two here with it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.450
 here three here and so on 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:35.349
 now is to get the block, let's put it 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:38.680
 here in front and end not only you 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:44.670
 remain the same here the others are going 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.670
 get here but mistaken rail 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 he passes energy teske 8 rails 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:00.190
 Let me tell you about it and I'll be right back. 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.260
 so I came back it goes up to 99 123456789 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.060
 and puts another block 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.150
 you see that actually having a name of a 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:18.070
 Lavender here triggers lv goes the time was 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:20.970
 plus 10 11 and 12 3 after hitting to get 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.650
 here the maximum here so you want 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.109
 but I think it gets very ugly until 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.950
 get on it will get nine even until 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.769
 nine 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:42.160
 there I had placed in the ninth month knew 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:44.799
 that 123456789 I'm sorry 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.760
 so let's top up the staff is the other side 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 is also now just put the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.690
 tribute in all the same 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.139
 I'm going to make it here now, I'm going to do it. 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.139
 the video 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.270
 so it can cap put the spirit 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:33.720
 let's put the mini kart 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:35.490
 remembering that here at the tip and now the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.960
 most importantly we will put the networks 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.960
 here or you do not have any connection 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.700
 and so goes beyond the means now we 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.700
 get here and we'll see the show 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:10.160
 the dispute waged there if the wada 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.300
 I'll be back I'm sorry I came by is 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.000
 locked 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.440
 so that's when the damn little is 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.760
 doing some touring around 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.010
 so that's it, it got there, cat, who did not 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.160
 the continuation 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.170
 But that's it, I hope you liked it. 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.390
 If you liked it click I liked it 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.570
 enough of the favorites that this helps 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.640
 connection of the channel and video and 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.550
 Are you new to Switzerland? You decide to write.

 down here to stay connected the next 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.330
 video was worth it and until the next tutorial I went
