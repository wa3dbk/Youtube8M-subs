00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.259
 hi to all dear friends welcome back 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.769
 in the company of two 86 together with htc 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.320
 one m8 the absence well bored the sales 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.599
 and maybe it's not for you you've done the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.439
 root to your device you have put 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.020
 the modified recovery and then for you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.859
 today we are going to review the google 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.800
 edition for htc one m8 google edition 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 which absolutely does not differ in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 nothing about his 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.510
 functions with regard to the whole 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 his package inside the nex 5 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 then a port put on htc juan n 8 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 as you know one m8 in the united states 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 it is also sold with the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
 therefore google stock customization 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 with precisely the google edition though 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.840
 we Italians can easily 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 flashing this type of Roma and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.280
 rom that I have to say works very very much 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 well there are no appointments of any 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 genre is a port I really well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.180
 in fact, it does not have a port 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.500
 the google edition app that htc together with 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.850
 google mounts on its devices 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 Android 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.110
 in this case the htc one m8 suffered from the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.909
 device off we can see that 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.439
 nothing is left to chance so we have 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.609
 all the various swipes that even on the one m8 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.640
 same with the 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.979
 with the stock rom then with sense 6 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.049
 as you can see swipe to the left 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.350
 to go to and reactivate the display 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.200
 swipe to the right for it too 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 return to the main menu in the home 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.090
 clearly there is no blinking but there 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.380
 would miss anything else because it is clearly 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.569
 the google edition swipe down 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.709
 as you can see we don't have the controls 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.259
 but then we'll see 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.420
 slightly all the settings 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.020
 as for the homescreen not 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.250
 changes absolutely nothing with swipe 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.899
 two fingers to clearly go to the menu 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.819
 main as you can see in the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.560
 notification center 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.060
 we immediately enter the setting vi 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.599
 I immediately show the info on the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.640
 device we have on board android e 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.280
 4.4.2 in stock version we have the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.220
 system upgrades as you can 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.379
 see the update is the most recent 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.200
 regarding the settings 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.450
 then we have the motion lange center 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.030
 to clearly go to enable 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
 all commands via swipe like 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.139
 you can see with the double tap swipe 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.680
 your site or the volume buttons for 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.389
 regarding the horizontal mode 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.040
 for all other settings not 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:52.109
 changes have really nothing like 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.200
 we have all settings in nex 5 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:58.560
 have been reported to be even on 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.780
 this htc one m8 we have the new one 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.549
 google camera but that's a plus 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.549
 regarding the update 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.950
 same as the camera via play 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.109
 store and all the controls work 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 it really works everything is not there 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.639
 problems in going to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.370
 take pictures while going to change them 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:21.239
 stations therefore all that a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.370
 nexus user can have on his nex 5 lo 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.370
 we can also have us on our htc 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.709
 juan n 8 all as you can see 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.599
 it runs very fluid there are not 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.850
 quarrels even with regards to 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.560
 the blogger of 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.620
 actions therefore I must say however a 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.050
 porting really well done as far as 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.020
 regards google stock works a lot 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.670
 very well we have the basic functions of the 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.160
 htc one m8 as the motion launch center 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.720
 but above all we have the speakers who 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.450
 I have to say 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.490
 users with nex 5 dream about them 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.170
 really regarding the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.230
 web browsing and clearly we have 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:05.840
 as a stock browser we have chrome then 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.850
 it works like all chrome work 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.670
 on the various phones so very much 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.819
 well possibility of right mode we have 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:21.299
 all the possibilities of any 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:23.070
 browser just a pure style then 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.770
 let's go immediately for example to open the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.680
 3 of xda which has a really very site 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.759
 a little heavy that goes to 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.130
 upload here clearly included 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.289
 stop of hdc works much better because 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.750
 are the size and text has a mode 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.270
 much more fluid much softer than the 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.099
 however we have to say navigation 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.710
 that also chrome 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.320
 regarding this google 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.099
 edition on htc one m8 works a lot 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 very well 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.590
 as you can see some ponds know 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.289
 at the beginning in the resais there is in the pinch e 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.680
 there is no lager in the pan it works 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.320
 all very very well so I have to 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.120
 still say a brief look for 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.880
 regarding this google edition 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.979
 it is not the definitive rome because there 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.110
 other updates will come to you 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.690
 over time it is a Roma that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.160
 immediately works very well is the 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.430
 my favorite rome 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.650
 well I must say that I bought hcc juan n 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.840
 8 to enjoy all its functions 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.199
 all his sense and look like 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.280
 we also have the google now mode 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.199
 on activation with swipe toward 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.960
 right 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.110
 I'll keep it but I don't know for sure now 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.180
 I put the absences 6 because because in 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.599
 I like this moment much more with 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.310
 the rom stock should hold this 8 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.240
 with the google edition maybe a 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.520
 little thought to the nex 5 should be done though 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830
 definitely if you want to try this rom 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.139
 it costs you nothing and works a lot 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.900
 very good flashes and simple solids 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.530
 wipe usually flash so it works a lot 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.930
 very well so nothing you are alone 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.360
 you 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.030
 so that you can decide if it deserves 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.490
 really flash this google edition 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.889
 I can say that in general it works 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.229
 all very well so not 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.240
 be afraid to go and put this 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.889
 kind of rom for today all there 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.889
 hear you at the next video
