00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
department store really and it's just

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.490 
department store really and it's just
like<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:35.030> 22<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.770> comes<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.819 

here<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.969> 22<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.710> be

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
here is this 22 like that it has to be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.529 
here is this 22 like that it has to be
one<00:00:46.950> hundred<00:00:47.039> percent<00:00:47.250> silicone<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.450> not

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
one hundred percent silicone if it's not

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
one hundred percent silicone if it's not
one<00:00:48.629> hundred<00:00:48.780> percent<00:00:48.960> silicon<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
one hundred percent silicon then it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.490 
one hundred percent silicon then it
would<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:49.980> work<00:00:50.449> trust<00:00:51.449> me<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
would not work trust me on this what you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.580 
would not work trust me on this what you
do<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> top<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.590> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
do is you just take the top off and you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.549 
do is you just take the top off and you
cut<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> piece<00:00:56.399> off<00:00:56.610> um<00:00:57.260> however<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.469> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
cut a piece off um however a bit of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
cut a piece off um however a bit of
peace<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.300> take

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
peace you want and then you take

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
peace you want and then you take
something<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.260> pointy<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> stick<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
something really pointy and you stick it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.549 
something really pointy and you stick it
down<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.820> hole<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.019> puncture<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
down in the hole so you can puncture the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.000 
down in the hole so you can puncture the
seal<00:01:05.150> arm<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> silicone<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.650> flow

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
seal arm so that the silicone can flow

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.000 
seal arm so that the silicone can flow
out<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.049> buy<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> these

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
out then you have to buy one of these

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.700 
out then you have to buy one of these
and<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:13.580> um<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> buy<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> chopped<00:01:16.470> gun

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and do um you have to buy a chopped gun

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.289 
and do um you have to buy a chopped gun
so<00:01:17.360> it'll<00:01:18.360> come<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.810> easier<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.759> whole<00:01:20.759> lot

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so it'll come out easier and whole lot

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.710 
so it'll come out easier and whole lot
better<00:01:21.710> way<00:01:22.710> better<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.180> fill<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
better way better and you just fill it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.240 
better way better and you just fill it
in<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.340> then<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.220> push<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.909> to
