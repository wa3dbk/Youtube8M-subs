00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
we're gonna take closer look at power of

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.339 
we're gonna take closer look at power of
the<00:00:09.610> force<00:00:09.820> to<00:00:10.059> freeze<00:00:10.869> frame

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
the force to freeze frame

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.779 
the force to freeze frame
question<00:00:11.799> three<00:00:12.099> this<00:00:12.249> is<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.490> final

collection in the freeze frame series

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.380 
collection in the freeze frame series
from<00:00:14.499> power<00:00:14.709> force<00:00:15.009> -<00:00:15.219> let's<00:00:15.969> take<00:00:16.119> closer

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
from power force - let's take closer

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.689 
from power force - let's take closer
look<00:00:16.630> so<00:00:17.590> here<00:00:17.769> is<00:00:17.859> a<00:00:17.890> closer<00:00:18.160> look<00:00:18.279> at<00:00:18.580> the

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
look so here is a closer look at the

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.730 
look so here is a closer look at the
power<00:00:18.910> force<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.509> collection<00:00:20.109> three<00:00:20.380> figures

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
power force to collection three figures

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.339 
power force to collection three figures
this<00:00:20.949> is<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:22.300> of<00:00:22.330> my<00:00:22.449> favorites<00:00:22.750> in<00:00:22.839> line<00:00:23.050> this

blue coloring on the bottom here and it

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.859 
blue coloring on the bottom here and it
says<00:00:29.710> question<00:00:30.579> 3<00:00:30.910> so<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.359> idea<00:00:31.630> of<00:00:31.660> that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
says question 3 so the idea of that

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.420 
says question 3 so the idea of that
different<00:00:32.290> color<00:00:32.470> codes<00:00:32.650> cuz<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.400> other

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
different color codes cuz the other

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.790 
different color codes cuz the other
question<00:00:33.820> 1<00:00:33.910> &amp;<00:00:34.060> 2<00:00:34.120> at<00:00:34.240> different<00:00:34.510> colors<00:00:34.800> and

question 1 &amp; 2 at different colors and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.590 
question 1 &amp; 2 at different colors and
it<00:00:36.400> wouldn't<00:00:36.640> look<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.970> pegs<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.330> stores

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
it wouldn't look in the pegs the stores
