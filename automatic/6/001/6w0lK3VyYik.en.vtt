grams I think and I don't know how much

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.930 
grams I think and I don't know how much
this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.280> packaging<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
this is because the packaging but the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.969 
this is because the packaging but the
packaging<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> same<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> definitely

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
packaging is the same so it definitely

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
packaging is the same so it definitely
could<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.370> comes<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.150> permanent<00:01:09.720> colors

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
could it comes with two permanent colors

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
could it comes with two permanent colors
and<00:01:10.440> then<00:01:10.620> one<00:01:11.430> limited<00:01:12.120> just<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and then one limited just for the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
and then one limited just for the
palette<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.250> called

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
palette which i think is called

like more of a rosy mauve color and it's
a<00:01:38.280> smidge<00:01:38.640> darker<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.570> looks<00:01:39.780> like

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
a smidge darker and this one looks like

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
a smidge darker and this one looks like
it's<00:01:40.080> more<00:01:40.260> of<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> light<00:01:40.530> peach<00:01:40.799> now

definitely<00:01:41.510> depends<00:01:42.510> on<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> design<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
definitely depends on the design that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
definitely depends on the design that
you<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.630> some<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> them<00:01:46.259> have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you get because I know some of them have

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.179 
you get because I know some of them have
more<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.850> pigment<00:01:48.390> than<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> other<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
more of one pigment than the other so to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.899 
more of one pigment than the other so to
me<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.759> worth<00:01:51.390> keeping<00:01:51.689> both<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
me it's worth keeping both because the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
me it's worth keeping both because the
one<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.780> lighter<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> light

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
one that I got is lighter like a light

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
one that I got is lighter like a light
pink<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.970> one<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
pink and then this one I have is more of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.039 
pink and then this one I have is more of
like<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.740> neutral<00:01:59.189> rose<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> keep<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.900> in

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
like a neutral rose just to keep that in

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.660 
like a neutral rose just to keep that in
mind<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.700> next<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.689> incandescent

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
mind so this next one is incandescent

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.830 
mind so this next one is incandescent
Electra<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> again<00:02:07.369> very<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:09.360> very

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
Electra and this is again very a very

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.220 
Electra and this is again very a very
cool<00:02:10.530> toned<00:02:10.860> peach<00:02:11.430> color<00:02:11.790> very<00:02:12.330> pretty

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
cool toned peach color very pretty

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
cool toned peach color very pretty
I<00:02:13.470> thought<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.760> would<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.769> like<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.980> same

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
I thought that it would be like the same

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.089 
I thought that it would be like the same
as<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.790> diffused<00:02:18.299> heat<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
as the diffused heat but it's not the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.420 
as the diffused heat but it's not the
diffused<00:02:20.519> heat<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.879> more<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:22.280> maybe<00:02:23.280> I'll

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
diffused heat is more of a maybe I'll

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.589 
diffused heat is more of a maybe I'll
put<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.580> swatch<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.390> more

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
put a swatch up here but it's just more

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.500 
put a swatch up here but it's just more
of<00:02:24.659> like<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.049> brighter<00:02:25.620> coral<00:02:26.250> Orange<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.360> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
of like a brighter coral Orange this is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.580 
of like a brighter coral Orange this is
like<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.659> cool-toned

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
like a cool-toned

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.089 
like a cool-toned
light<00:02:28.980> peach<00:02:29.819> color<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
light peach color and I really like it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.619 
light peach color and I really like it
especially<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.030> flush<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.599> the

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
especially just for a flush on the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.220 
especially just for a flush on the
cheeks<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.260> feel<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:35.269> all<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.540> these<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:37.019> be

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
cheeks I feel like all of these would be

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.369 
cheeks I feel like all of these would be
very<00:02:37.260> pretty<00:02:37.950> as<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.910> blush<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.690> fair<00:02:40.019> and

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
very pretty as a blush of your fair and

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.229 
very pretty as a blush of your fair and
if<00:02:40.500> you're<00:02:40.650> darker<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> medium<00:02:41.700> skin<00:02:42.000> toned

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
if you're darker or a medium skin toned

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.979 
if you're darker or a medium skin toned
it<00:02:42.659> would<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> pretty<00:02:43.140> as<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.980> highlight<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.900> in

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it would be pretty as a highlight so in

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.809 
it would be pretty as a highlight so in
the<00:02:46.049> very<00:02:46.170> last<00:02:46.470> which<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.040> don't<00:02:47.099> have<00:02:47.519> either

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
the very last which I don't have either

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.619 
the very last which I don't have either
is<00:02:48.180> called<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.599> luminous<00:02:49.049> flush<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:51.480> is

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
is called a luminous flush and that is

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.410 
is called a luminous flush and that is
this<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:51.989> here<00:02:52.590> let's<00:02:53.280> swatch<00:02:53.879> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
this one right here let's swatch it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.009 
this one right here let's swatch it
and<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.379> definitely<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:56.989> peachy<00:02:57.989> color

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and this is definitely a peachy color

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.710 
and this is definitely a peachy color
and<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> will<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.220> tell<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.609> that<00:02:59.910> it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
and I will have to tell you that it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.699 
and I will have to tell you that it's
very<00:03:01.170> similar<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.519> incandescent<00:03:03.709> one

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
very similar to the incandescent one

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.530 
very similar to the incandescent one
actually<00:03:05.609> totally<00:03:05.970> messed<00:03:06.180> up<00:03:06.329> on<00:03:06.480> these<00:03:08.540> of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
actually totally messed up on these of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.660 
actually totally messed up on these of
them<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.799> luminous<00:03:11.310> flesh<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:14.190> little

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
them so the luminous flesh is a little

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.559 
them so the luminous flesh is a little
bit<00:03:15.799> more<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.980> coral<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
bit more of a coral and then the

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.839 
bit more of a coral and then the
incandescent<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.099> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.489> peachy

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
incandescent is just a little bit peachy

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.159 
incandescent is just a little bit peachy
ER<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.720> tell<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.989> something

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
ER and I have to tell you something

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.930 
ER and I have to tell you something
really<00:03:22.440> funny<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.130> I'll<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.579> show<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.849> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
really funny and I'll have to show it to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.089 
really funny and I'll have to show it to
you<00:03:24.030> up<00:03:24.090> close<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.690> messed<00:03:25.349> up<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
you up close but they messed up on the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.440 
you up close but they messed up on the
wording<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.639> back<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.030> that's<00:03:27.150> why<00:03:27.299> it's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
wording on the back and that's why it's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.750 
wording on the back and that's why it's
confusing<00:03:27.630> me<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.260> over<00:03:28.799> here<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.549> mood

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
confusing me so over here is mood

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.849 
confusing me so over here is mood
exposure<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.660> they<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.989> luminous<00:03:31.530> flush

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
exposure and they have luminous flush

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.699 
exposure and they have luminous flush
then<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.090> incandescent<00:03:33.810> Elektra<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
then they have incandescent Elektra and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.870 
then they have incandescent Elektra and
then<00:03:34.950> here<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:37.400> luminous<00:03:38.400> flush<00:03:38.639> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
then here this is the luminous flush and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.839 
then here this is the luminous flush and
behind<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.840> mood<00:03:40.079> exposure<00:03:40.730> which<00:03:41.730> is

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
behind it is the mood exposure which is

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.309 
behind it is the mood exposure which is
really<00:03:42.060> funny<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.510> they<00:03:42.599> totally<00:03:42.900> mess<00:03:43.049> up<00:03:43.169> on

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
really funny so they totally mess up on

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.470 
really funny so they totally mess up on
the<00:03:43.410> wording<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.519> overall<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.090> really

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
the wording on that so overall I really

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.720 
the wording on that so overall I really
like<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.900> palette<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.130> wanted<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.459> share

exclusive<00:04:03.540> colors<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.230> palettes<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.829> think

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
exclusive colors to palettes I think

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.500

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.289
