word I was looking for very simple word

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.940 
word I was looking for very simple word
but<00:01:57.149> I'll<00:01:57.360> pretty<00:01:57.689> much<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.869> broken<00:01:58.380> which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
but I'll pretty much be broken which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
but I'll pretty much be broken which
you'll<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> minute<00:01:59.790> which<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.479> of

you'll see in a minute which is kind of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
you'll see in a minute which is kind of
obvious<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> obvious<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and because pretty much what would have

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.010 
and because pretty much what would have
happened<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:23.360> survival<00:02:23.900> mode

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
happened there is if I'm survival mode

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.170 
happened there is if I'm survival mode
that<00:02:24.230> creeper<00:02:24.650> would<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:24.920> blown<00:02:25.700> up<00:02:25.970> and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
that creeper would have blown up and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.580 
that creeper would have blown up and
kills<00:02:26.510> me<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:28.209> couch<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.720> was<00:02:29.870> close<00:02:30.080> but

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
kills me and a couch that was close but

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.900 
kills me and a couch that was close but
as<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.800> may<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:30.920> sold<00:02:31.160> their<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.670> and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
as you may have sold their that and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.150 
as you may have sold their that and
pretty<00:02:32.480> much<00:02:32.570> how<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.870> works<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.860> block

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
pretty much how it works is the block

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.570 
pretty much how it works is the block
slides<00:02:34.640> across<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.560> button<00:02:36.560> bricks<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.550> I

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
slides across the button bricks so I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.940 
slides across the button bricks so I
have<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.850> button<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.600> even<00:02:39.470> though<00:02:39.770> it's

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
have a button here and even though it's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.350 
have a button here and even though it's
going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> ruin<00:02:40.400> everything<00:02:40.580> let's<00:02:41.030> pretend

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
going to ruin everything let's pretend

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.240 
going to ruin everything let's pretend
this<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.630> survival<00:02:41.959> mode<00:02:42.640> no<00:02:43.640> no<00:02:43.820> hmm<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.980> that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
this is survival mode no no hmm so that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
this is survival mode no no hmm so that
would<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.550> happened<00:02:47.350> except<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.470> would

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
would have happened except that would

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.290 
would have happened except that would
have<00:02:48.650> died<00:02:49.750> no<00:02:50.750> full<00:02:51.500> wiring<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.610> all<00:02:52.970> up

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
have died no full wiring this is all up

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.199 
have died no full wiring this is all up
there<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.080> pretty<00:02:54.440> much<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.640> very<00:02:56.120> easy

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
there is pretty much it's very very easy

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.979 
there is pretty much it's very very easy
to<00:02:56.930> make<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:58.060> although<00:02:59.060> there<00:02:59.390> are<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> couple

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
to make this although there are a couple

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.930 
to make this although there are a couple
of<00:03:00.260> things<00:03:00.320> which<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.010> may<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.310> not<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
of things which you may have not and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.870 
of things which you may have not and
realized<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:03.110> part<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:04.820> of

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
realized we're part of it and one of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.330 
realized we're part of it and one of
them<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.980> has<00:03:07.690> got<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:09.110> timer<00:03:09.890> here

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
them is that this has got a timer here

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.430 
them is that this has got a timer here
and<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.360> block<00:03:11.660> here<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.080> stair

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and that this block here is a stair

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.470 
and that this block here is a stair
block<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.980> there<00:03:13.400> are<00:03:13.580> some<00:03:13.790> reason<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.330> this

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
block and there are some reason for this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.310 
block and there are some reason for this
but<00:03:15.230> i<00:03:15.260> will<00:03:15.530> explain<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.070> basic<00:03:16.400> log<00:03:16.610> logic

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
but i will explain the basic log logic

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.140 
but i will explain the basic log logic
4.4<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:19.070> pretty<00:03:19.190> much<00:03:19.400> when<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.850> press

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
4.4 and it's pretty much when you press

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.240 
4.4 and it's pretty much when you press
the<00:03:20.299> button<00:03:20.329> which<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.989> behind<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.950> block

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the button which is behind this block

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.280 
the button which is behind this block
here<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.730> redstone<00:03:23.450> signal<00:03:23.690> would<00:03:24.049> be

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
here a redstone signal would be

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.440 
here a redstone signal would be
instantly<00:03:24.769> sent<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:25.640> activating<00:03:26.360> it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
instantly sent to this activating it

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.800 
instantly sent to this activating it
pushing<00:03:26.930> whatever<00:03:27.320> gets<00:03:28.010> pushed<00:03:28.280> out<00:03:28.459> into

repeater down here and into the piston
which<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.180> pushes<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.720> stair<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.200> place

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
which then pushes the stair in place

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.130 
which then pushes the stair in place
very<00:03:46.790> simple<00:03:47.120> although<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.959> may<00:03:48.079> be

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
very simple although you may be

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.319 
very simple although you may be

repeater as i said before well there are
a<00:03:52.940> couple<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.329> reasons<00:03:53.450> for<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.840> which<00:03:54.170> i

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
a couple of reasons for this which i

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.759 
a couple of reasons for this which i
have<00:03:54.500> got<00:03:54.709> here<00:03:55.130> now<00:03:55.820> this<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.530> have

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
have got here now this is when you have

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.930 
have got here now this is when you have
nothing<00:03:58.489> here<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.769> i<00:04:00.769> like<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> new<00:04:01.549> repeater

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
nothing here and i like a new repeater

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.510 
nothing here and i like a new repeater
here<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.480> she<00:04:03.350> only<00:04:03.560> have

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
here and she only have

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.960 
here and she only have
for<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:05.210> button<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.190> what<00:04:07.190> happens<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.760> that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
for a button and what happens is that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.800 
for a button and what happens is that
when<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.420> press<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.730> button<00:04:11.180> gets<00:04:11.360> pushed

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
when you press it the button gets pushed

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.670 
when you press it the button gets pushed
away<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.730> doesn't<00:04:14.090> actually<00:04:14.680> activate

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
away and it doesn't actually activate

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.160 
away and it doesn't actually activate
the<00:04:15.830> pressure<00:04:16.040> plate<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.550> that<00:04:17.420> is<00:04:17.660> because

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
the pressure plate and that is because

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.370 
the pressure plate and that is because
of<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:19.100> fact<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.459> at<00:04:20.330> when<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.959> push<00:04:21.290> your

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
of the fact that at when you push your

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.940 
of the fact that at when you push your
button<00:04:22.390> sorry<00:04:23.390> I'm<00:04:23.510> creative<00:04:23.840> mode<00:04:23.990> when<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
button sorry I'm creative mode when you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.340 
button sorry I'm creative mode when you
push<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.220> what<00:04:25.940> happens<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.780> block<00:04:27.080> behind

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
push it what happens is the block behind

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.040 
push it what happens is the block behind
it<00:04:27.680> paresh<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.430> dispenser<00:04:29.000> but<00:04:29.720> if<00:04:29.870> you're

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
it paresh the dispenser but if you're

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.380 
it paresh the dispenser but if you're
pushing<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:30.560> block<00:04:30.860> away<00:04:31.040> then<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:32.180> book

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
pushing that block away then the book

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.380 
pushing that block away then the book
with<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.140> red<00:04:33.260> stamp<00:04:33.560> are<00:04:34.000> doesn't<00:04:35.000> have<00:04:35.120> time

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
with the red stamp are doesn't have time

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.170 
with the red stamp are doesn't have time
to<00:04:35.450> activate<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.200> piston<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.430> what<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.060> need

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
to activate the piston so what you need

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.570 
to activate the piston so what you need
to<00:04:38.330> do<00:04:38.480> is<00:04:38.510> alloyed<00:04:39.110> have<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:40.070> have<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> time

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
to do is alloyed have it to have a time

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.850 
to do is alloyed have it to have a time
limit<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.990> will<00:04:42.230> be<00:04:42.290> able<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.710> push

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
limit so that it will be able to push

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.700 
limit so that it will be able to push
the<00:04:43.010> best<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.370> very<00:04:43.910> very<00:04:44.270> simple<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.530> will

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
the best in very very simple and I will

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.460 
the best in very very simple and I will
throw<00:04:45.950> these<00:04:46.130> away<00:04:46.840> no<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.050> next<00:04:48.230> thing<00:04:48.440> is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
throw these away no the next thing is

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.910 
throw these away no the next thing is
that<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.910> repeater<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.420> grid<00:04:50.920> why

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
that you have the repeater in grid why

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.460 
that you have the repeater in grid why
do<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.070> disturb<00:04:52.610> lock<00:04:52.880> there<00:04:53.180> well<00:04:53.990> there<00:04:54.380> is

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
do you disturb lock there well there is

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.080 
do you disturb lock there well there is
a<00:04:54.500> reason<00:04:54.800> for<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.370> will<00:04:55.610> show<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.820> the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
a reason for it but I will show you the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.910 
a reason for it but I will show you the
example<00:04:56.480> first<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.080> what<00:04:57.230> happens<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.740> when

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
example first so what happens is when

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.610 
example first so what happens is when
you<00:04:58.010> press<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> button<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:59.140> does<00:05:00.140> send<00:05:00.410> out

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
you press the button it does send out

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.800 
you press the button it does send out
the<00:05:00.800> Apple<00:05:01.220> which<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:01.970> have<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.360> time<00:05:02.540> as<00:05:02.720> my

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
the Apple which I have this time as my

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.390 
the Apple which I have this time as my
example<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.680> button<00:05:03.980> doesn't<00:05:04.280> get

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
example but the button doesn't get

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.270 
example but the button doesn't get
destroyed<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:06.080> due<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.890> glitch

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
destroyed and that is due to a glitch

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.510 
destroyed and that is due to a glitch
where<00:05:07.790> if<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.210> block<00:05:08.480> is<00:05:08.660> being<00:05:08.870> pushed<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:09.520> but

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
where if a block is being pushed and but

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.150 
where if a block is being pushed and but
the<00:05:10.940> redstone<00:05:11.630> signal<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:12.170> is<00:05:12.860> being

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
the redstone signal is is being

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.190 
the redstone signal is is being
activated<00:05:13.580> or<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.210> activating<00:05:14.870> something

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
activated or it is activating something

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.330 
activated or it is activating something
it<00:05:15.560> doesn't<00:05:15.890> get<00:05:16.100> destroyed<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.920> I'm

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
it doesn't get destroyed but and I'm

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.400 
it doesn't get destroyed but and I'm
sorry<00:05:19.640> with<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.060> stair<00:05:20.360> block<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.960> still

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
sorry with the stair block that still

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.650 
sorry with the stair block that still
happens<00:05:21.890> so<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.610> button<00:05:22.850> still<00:05:23.060> gets

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
happens so it the button still gets

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.990 
happens so it the button still gets
moved<00:05:23.870> without<00:05:24.020> being<00:05:24.380> destroyed<00:05:24.680> but<00:05:25.490> one

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
moved without being destroyed but one

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.370 
moved without being destroyed but one
thing<00:05:26.240> interesting<00:05:26.600> about<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.990> stair<00:05:27.200> block

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
thing interesting about the stair block

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.710 
thing interesting about the stair block
is<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.830> isn't<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.550> solid<00:05:28.910> block<00:05:29.030> it's<00:05:29.420> what

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
is that it isn't a solid block it's what

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.930 
is that it isn't a solid block it's what
you<00:05:29.870> call<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.050> translation<00:05:30.680> block<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.160> you

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
you call a translation block and you

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.340 
you call a translation block and you
cannot<00:05:32.210> place<00:05:32.510> bottoms<00:05:32.900> on<00:05:33.050> translucent

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
cannot place bottoms on translucent

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.070 
cannot place bottoms on translucent
blocks<00:05:33.910> translation<00:05:34.910> translucent<00:05:35.720> blocks

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
blocks translation translucent blocks

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.250 
blocks translation translucent blocks
and<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:38.060> pretty<00:05:38.300> much<00:05:38.420> means<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.050> game

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
and that pretty much means that the game

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.680 
and that pretty much means that the game
will<00:05:39.620> calculate<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.640> that<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.330> something

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
will calculate that that is something

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.600 
will calculate that that is something
that<00:05:41.840> cannot<00:05:42.170> happen<00:05:42.230> and<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:43.160> will<00:05:43.280> simply

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
that cannot happen and it will simply

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.840 
that cannot happen and it will simply
break<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:45.140> button<00:05:45.830> off<00:05:45.950> in<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.370> block<00:05:46.580> by

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
break the button off in the block by

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.870 
break the button off in the block by
just<00:05:47.180> general<00:05:47.660> game<00:05:47.870> mechanics<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.640> is

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
just general game mechanics so that is

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.180 
just general game mechanics so that is
how<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:50.480> works<00:05:51.050> pretty<00:05:51.350> much<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.800> that's<00:05:51.950> why

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
how it works pretty much and that's why
