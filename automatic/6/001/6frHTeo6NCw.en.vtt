easy<00:00:40.680> pour<00:00:41.180> this<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.720> particular<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
easy pour this one here in particular I

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
easy pour this one here in particular I
like<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.220> it<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.580> extended<00:00:45.540> spout

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
like because it has a extended spout

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
like because it has a extended spout
that<00:00:46.020> after<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> top<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.150> of<00:00:48.360> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that after you take the top off of it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
that after you take the top off of it
the<00:00:49.080> spout<00:00:49.410> doesn't<00:00:49.830> allow<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.070> paint<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the spout doesn't allow that paint to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.390 
the spout doesn't allow that paint to
drip<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.420> onto<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.900> side<00:00:52.080> of<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.650> also

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
drip down onto the side of the can also

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.670 
drip down onto the side of the can also
there's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.269> reservoir<00:00:54.540> in<00:00:55.080> here<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
there's a little reservoir in here that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
there's a little reservoir in here that
whatever<00:00:56.100> does<00:00:56.400> drip<00:00:56.699> past<00:00:56.970> here<00:00:57.239> will<00:00:57.420> run

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
whatever does drip past here will run

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
whatever does drip past here will run
back<00:00:57.870> around<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.769> into<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.220> can

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
back around and go back into the can

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
back around and go back into the can
hence<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.600> having<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.170> mess<00:01:01.470> all<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
hence not having that mess all over the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
hence not having that mess all over the
side<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.339> your<00:01:02.550> camp<00:01:02.879> paint<00:01:03.180> pan<00:01:03.559> nobody<00:01:04.559> likes

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to clean them they're all pretty much

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
to clean them they're all pretty much
the<00:01:06.600> same<00:01:06.810> design<00:01:07.230> they've<00:01:07.740> looked<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> same

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the same design they've looked the same

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
the same design they've looked the same
for<00:01:08.550> years<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.650> working

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
with a latex paint yeah you can buy a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.360 
with a latex paint yeah you can buy a
liner<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.260> disposable<00:01:16.260> liner<00:01:16.620> that<00:01:16.800> goes<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
liner a disposable liner that goes in

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.399 
liner a disposable liner that goes in
here<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.330> makes<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> less<00:01:18.840> difficult

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
here so that it makes it less difficult

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.510 
here so that it makes it less difficult
to<00:01:19.530> clean<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:21.240> another<00:01:22.050> option<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to clean or another option is is you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
to clean or another option is is you
could<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.909> small<00:01:24.090> trash<00:01:24.869> bag<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.579> put<00:01:26.579> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
could take a small trash bag and put it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
could take a small trash bag and put it
over<00:01:26.880> top<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.329> your<00:01:28.290> pan<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:30.020> basically<00:01:31.020> use

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
over top of your pan and basically use

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
over top of your pan and basically use
that<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:31.890> paint<00:01:32.369> pan<00:01:32.640> liner<00:01:32.969> getting

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that as your paint pan liner getting

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.959 
that as your paint pan liner getting
dual<00:01:34.229> you'll<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.399> out<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.789> this

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
dual you'll still use out of this

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.069 
dual you'll still use out of this
