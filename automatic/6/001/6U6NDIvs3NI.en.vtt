 It is Kathy Santo. 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.500
 Today, for Haudini's Imes, 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.500
 I will talk about the dangers of puppy biting, how to play correctly, and how to eliminate bites. 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 It is also normal and cute for the puppy to bite your hand or jump in your hand. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.200
 It was natural for your puppy to spend biting with other puppy born with him, and to play biting together. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.500
 Of course, it is understandable to think that playing with you is the same. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 However, when the puppy's teeth grow and the body gets stronger, the cute bite becomes uncomfortable 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 It can even be dangerous if it is rough or bitten. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.200
 As chewing is a bad play, let's teach you how to play with toys, not your hands. 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.500
 Playing is a healthy and natural act that strengthens the bond between you and your puppy. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 This also relates to puppy training. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.100
 In other words, sitting, waiting or learning tricks 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.500
 So do not pull the lead and then stop biting. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.000
 Before teaching your puppy not to bite, teach them to reduce their biting strength. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 I will put your hand up and scratch it. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 When you bite strongly, cries out "painful" and stops biting for a moment while being surprised. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.500
 Keeping your puppy holding your hand all the time, and if you bitten too hard, you would repeat the crying "painful", 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 Puppies can learn how much they are allowed. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.800
 If you can understand how it bites, reduce biting. 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.500
 To teach the puppy not to bite, give them toys and bones to bite. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 Tell the puppy firmly "Don't get it" and replace the bite with something you can bite. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.300
 If your puppy is three to six months old, it may be time for your teeth to grow. 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 Therefore, there is also a possibility that you are trying to eliminate the feeling of discomfort by biting. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.500
 Please raise ice cubes and bite them. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 This will eliminate the sensation of gums and reduce pain. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 The puppy behaves as if to hurt me, my friend, to stop the sweet bite. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 I let go of my hand and yell "aching", stop playing and act as if I were injured. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 That is, if the puppy does something that causes pain 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.500
 It mimics the action that other playmates will do. 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.300
 Dealing with puppy bites is a big challenge for owners. 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 At first it is a little fun for the puppy to bite, 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.200
 We need to deal with it right away so that it won't be a lasting problem. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.500
 Dog training depends on good relationships based on love and trust. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 It takes time to create a partner relationship. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 The more patient you take from the beginning, the more puppies will be obedient to you. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 Dogs want to please people. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.500
 Kathy Santo talked to Haudini's Imes. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 I hope today's story will be useful.
