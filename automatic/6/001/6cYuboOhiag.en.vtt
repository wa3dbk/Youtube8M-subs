00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.969
 press conference of the year 2012 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.290
 the party was first opened by the kaiserslautern 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.540
 basking against the vfr we welcome 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.160

 hasenhüttl our chef trainer franco 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.039
 Please foda and I offer to be hospitable 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.280
 comment on the game 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.559
 yes when I here so great that you all 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.199
 you see what you are here today 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.360
 has played many club and that is 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 of course a great experience for us 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.760
 allowed to play here and then too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.750
 such a crowning conclusion of a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 incredible unbelievable year 212 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 that's natural, of course 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.619
 most beautiful christkind what you yourself 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.770
 could have done 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.630
 I think we were very much today 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.619
 Discipline much of what we do 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 as tactics have taken as a plan 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.860
 we have implemented well and of course 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 I never played happy 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.080
 to the opponent here but the gate was 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.549
 excellently played with gossip 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 Game relocation as well as being me 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.659
 wanted and that hits the ball and so 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 of course was sensational in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.520
 maybe something unfortunate 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.740
 team today we think so yes 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 with man and mouse then to the end 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 defends the pressure there will of course 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960
 Huge here and the audience is doing 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.970
 rest 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.590
 but we already have a lot away this year 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.600
 very often consisted of randomly be 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.759
 because a lot works really well and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.590
 That's why we stand where we as 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.149
 newcomers and not expected 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.250
 and accordingly happy and 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.109
 We are proud of this team 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.549
 be what it has achieved in the year 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:08.619
 that is steeped in history to believe them 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.200
 deserves a special praise from mine 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 page at this point I say again 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 Thank you for an incredible year 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.510
 hip, trendy, popular 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.920
 thank you ralph hasenhüttl franco foda 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.489
 comments we have of course 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.090
 especially today presented something different 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.410
 what the dot yield we were 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.819
 I believe the 90 minutes clear 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.630
 dominating team we have 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.180
 an estimated 75 75 percent felt 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.900
 ball possession alone possession shoots 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 no goals 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.420
 Of course you are the first half 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.040
 It's true that we often play 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 very well prepared but im 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.299
 attack third has then the last pass 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.340
 we were missing in the attack third 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.769
 then we just do not have each other 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.750
 can enforce the one 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.430
 possibility would have been clear to normal 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.040
 eleven meters have to get to baumjohann 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.139
 he was not given then in 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.730
 residue 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:07.480
 practically from the second of the chance 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.099
 of ahlen 2 of the eleventh I can 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.510
 Do not blame the team 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.160
 has invested everything we have on one 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.470
 The opponent played 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.510
 just in the final phase again with 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.000
 a two ways solve otherwise 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.410
 we were returned to form had 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.680
 many play situations in the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.540
 Attack thirds also have its author 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
 that was not recognized, too 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think was rightly not recognized 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.819
 but still hit us somewhere 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.720
 then straight forward 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.560
 this assertiveness these these 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.560
 consistently in the gate 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
 we missed that today and therefore 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.910
 but ultimately not this game 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.260
 but can win because of the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.510
 fact that the team second 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.769
 I've been able to invest half of everything 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.319
 actually do not blame 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.480
 except that we scored no goals 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.989
 and unfortunately lost 43 points 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.450
 to have 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.840
 Of course I want to be with the fans 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.810
 once again thank all fans 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.250
 happy Christmas, too bad that we 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.560
 celebrate no success together today 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810
 could of course wish all one 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.099
 Happy new year and above all 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.720
 good luck for the new year and 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.209

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.329
 Of course, all journalists, too 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.040

 theater i have to do that from my side 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.090

 to be there and come too 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.020
 Again, the easier the teams 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.910
 play as I would like to be in 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.960
