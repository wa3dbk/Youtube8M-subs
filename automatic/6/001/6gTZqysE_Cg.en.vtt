00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
these pieces those red tiles because i

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
these pieces those red tiles because i
thought<00:01:03.239> i<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.589> thought<00:01:04.589> their<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> kinda

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

thought i would thought their be kinda
did<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:06.360> cool<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
did they look cool so I got some of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in these are tiles not bricks that I was

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.320 
in these are tiles not bricks that I was
going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.200> mud<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.270> actually<00:01:21.270> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
steps for building the model when I'm

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.250 
steps for building the model when I'm
doing<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:13.590> solo<00:02:13.829> me<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.099> three<00:02:14.250> parts<00:02:14.549> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
doing it solo me like three parts and

last<00:03:18.750> month<00:03:19.049> when<00:03:19.229> i<00:03:19.349> went<00:03:19.560> i<00:03:19.769> mean<00:03:20.220> they<00:03:21.090> had

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
last month when i went i mean they had

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.770 
last month when i went i mean they had
the<00:03:21.389> july<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:22.430> knocks<00:03:23.430> i<00:03:23.669> was<00:03:24.180> June<00:03:24.479> when<00:03:24.690> I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the july one knocks i was June when I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.599 
the july one knocks i was June when I
went<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.319> didn't<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.919> July<00:03:26.159> one<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
went and I didn't have the July one so

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.689 
went and I didn't have the July one so
those<00:03:27.109> they<00:03:28.109> have<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:28.620> guess<00:03:29.010> makes<00:03:29.430> sense

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
those they have it I guess makes sense

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.879 
those they have it I guess makes sense
because<00:03:29.849> it's<00:03:30.180> like<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.169> next<00:03:31.470> month<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
because it's like the next month you

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.399 
because it's like the next month you
want<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.159> be<00:03:32.250> prepared<00:03:32.459> for<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:33.690> anyways

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
want to be prepared for it so anyways

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.920 
want to be prepared for it so anyways
yeah<00:03:34.590> um<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.959> yeah<00:03:37.229> um<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:38.280> guess<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.389> about<00:03:39.690> it

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
yeah um so yeah um I guess this about it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.949 
yeah um so yeah um I guess this about it
so<00:03:40.829> probably<00:03:41.790> from<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.389> every<00:03:42.750> time<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.930> go

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
so probably from now on every time I go

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.330 
so probably from now on every time I go
to<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.199> lego<00:03:43.319> store<00:03:43.409> make<00:03:43.829> like<00:03:43.979> a<00:03:44.099> whole

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
to the lego store make like a whole

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.030 
to the lego store make like a whole
video<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.470> yeah<00:03:46.470> I'm<00:03:46.620> actually<00:03:46.769> pretty
