don't know if I'll be involved or not I
definitely<00:01:00.380> want<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.710> make<00:01:00.800> sure<00:01:00.920> it's

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
definitely want to make sure it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.280 
definitely want to make sure it's
carried<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:02.030> right<00:01:02.240> place<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:02.840> I'm

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
carried on to the right place so I'm

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.520 
carried on to the right place so I'm
sure<00:01:03.530> I'll<00:01:03.710> have<00:01:03.890> some<00:01:04.220> level<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.760> involvement

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
sure I'll have some level of involvement

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.289 
sure I'll have some level of involvement
but<00:01:06.530> there<00:01:06.649> are<00:01:06.679> ideas<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.250> are<00:01:07.850> subtly

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
but there are ideas that are subtly

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.630 
but there are ideas that are subtly
buried<00:01:08.659> into<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.140> film<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.130> suggests<00:01:10.310> we

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
buried into this film that suggests we

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.819 
buried into this film that suggests we
could<00:01:10.909> go<00:01:11.119> someplace<00:01:11.420> beyond<00:01:12.109> where<00:01:12.439> we<00:01:12.469> are

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
could go someplace beyond where we are

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.120 
could go someplace beyond where we are
and<00:01:13.820> he<00:01:13.939> goes<00:01:14.149> on<00:01:14.359> one<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.439> them<00:01:15.619> is<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.979> this

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
and he goes on one of them is that this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.679 
and he goes on one of them is that this
little<00:01:16.490> group<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.820> scientists<00:01:17.240> won't<00:01:17.420> always

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
little group of scientists won't always

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.569 
little group of scientists won't always
be<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.350> only<00:01:18.560> people<00:01:19.039> who<00:01:19.189> can<00:01:19.369> make<00:01:19.549> a

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
be the only people who can make a

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.999 
be the only people who can make a
dinosaur<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.869> what<00:01:21.079> if<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.289> technology<00:01:21.890> was

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
dinosaur so what if that technology was

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.099 
dinosaur so what if that technology was
to<00:01:22.159> go<00:01:22.310> open<00:01:22.789> source<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.240> everybody<00:01:23.719> could<00:01:23.929> do

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
to go open source and everybody could do

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.440 
to go open source and everybody could do
it<00:01:24.259> what<00:01:24.770> kind<00:01:25.070> of<00:01:25.159> world<00:01:25.399> would<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.880> be<00:01:26.119> now

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it what kind of world would that be now

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.090 
it what kind of world would that be now
this<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.630> very<00:01:26.899> important<00:01:27.469> because<00:01:27.560> Colin

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
this is very important because Colin

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.649 
this is very important because Colin
Trevorrow<00:01:28.219> has<00:01:28.729> done<00:01:28.939> very<00:01:28.969> well<00:01:29.299> off<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
Trevorrow has done very well off the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.139 
Trevorrow has done very well off the
back<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.289> film<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.859> I<00:01:31.729> wouldn't<00:01:32.090> be

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
back of this film and I wouldn't be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.279 
back of this film and I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:32.539> he's<00:01:32.749> going<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:32.990> be<00:01:33.049> closely

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
surprised he's going to be closely

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.289 
surprised he's going to be closely
involved<00:01:33.770> with<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.310> sequel<00:01:34.700> whether<00:01:34.909> we<00:01:35.060> like

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
involved with the sequel whether we like

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.770 
involved with the sequel whether we like
that<00:01:35.569> or<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:36.259> now<00:01:37.100> he<00:01:37.159> talks<00:01:37.729> here<00:01:37.999> about<00:01:38.030> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
that or not now he talks here about the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.139 
that or not now he talks here about the
technology<00:01:39.289> going<00:01:39.799> open<00:01:40.219> source<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.759> create

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
technology going open source to create

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.980 
technology going open source to create
dinosaurs<00:01:41.770> almost<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.159> leaked

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
dinosaurs almost like it's leaked

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.330

when you think about all of the stuff
that's<00:01:48.979> happened<00:01:49.399> with<00:01:49.549> Edward<00:01:50.240> Snowden<00:01:50.719> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that's happened with Edward Snowden and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.910 
that's happened with Edward Snowden and
WikiLeaks<00:01:52.090> what<00:01:53.090> if<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.810> DNA<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:54.829> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
WikiLeaks what if the DNA and all the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.389 
WikiLeaks what if the DNA and all the
genetic<00:01:55.359> material<00:01:56.359> and<00:01:56.929> information<00:01:57.399> was

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
genetic material and information was

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.099 
genetic material and information was
actually<00:01:58.729> open<00:01:59.030> source<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.359> was<00:01:59.479> online<00:01:59.630> and

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
actually open source it was online and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.499 
actually open source it was online and
people<00:02:00.319> could<00:02:00.709> replicate<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.459> they<00:02:02.179> can<00:02:02.359> just

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
people could replicate it they can just

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.719 
people could replicate it they can just
recreate<00:02:02.689> dinosaurs<00:02:03.499> wherever<00:02:04.039> they<00:02:04.249> are<00:02:04.280> and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
recreate dinosaurs wherever they are and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.270 
recreate dinosaurs wherever they are and
then<00:02:05.479> what<00:02:05.929> does<00:02:06.109> that<00:02:06.139> do<00:02:06.530> with<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
then what does that do with the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.620 
then what does that do with the
storyline<00:02:07.759> concerning<00:02:08.479> weaponizing

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
storyline concerning weaponizing

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.080 
storyline concerning weaponizing
dinosaurs<00:02:10.140> does<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.650> mean<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> nations

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
dinosaurs does this mean that nations

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.780 
dinosaurs does this mean that nations
will<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.750> able<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.140> weaponize<00:02:13.490> dinosaurs<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
will be able to weaponize dinosaurs and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.150 
will be able to weaponize dinosaurs and
then<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.930> actually<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> war<00:02:16.860> between

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
then we can actually see a war between

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.420 
then we can actually see a war between
dinosaurs<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:19.140> wondering<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.250> where

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
dinosaurs I'm wondering if this is where

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330 
dinosaurs I'm wondering if this is where
the<00:02:20.550> story<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:21.000> Jurassic<00:02:21.540> Park<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the story of Jurassic Park is going the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190 
the story of Jurassic Park is going the
idea<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.760> weaponizing<00:02:24.270> dinosaurs<00:02:24.900> was

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
idea of weaponizing dinosaurs was

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.220 
idea of weaponizing dinosaurs was
touched<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:26.010> jurassic<00:02:26.850> world<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.390> maybe

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
touched on in jurassic world and maybe

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.440 
touched on in jurassic world and maybe
it's<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.740> elaborated<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it's going to be elaborated on for the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
it's going to be elaborated on for the
next<00:02:30.600> film<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> film<00:02:32.010> might<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.430> start

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
next film so the film might well start

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.940 
next film so the film might well start
off<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.420> leaking<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.990> information<00:02:34.140> or

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
off with the leaking of information or

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.980 
off with the leaking of information or
establishing<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.850> people<00:02:36.540> who<00:02:36.840> are

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
working at engine and jurassic world

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.420 
working at engine and jurassic world
aren't<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> only<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:40.200> who<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.160> making

aren't the only people who are making

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
aren't the only people who are making
dinosaurs<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.960> film<00:02:43.170> could

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
dinosaurs and then the film could

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.680 
dinosaurs and then the film could
progress<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.580> fact<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.000> nation<00:02:45.510> is
