inch seam allowance when you come to the
corner<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.609> stop<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.539> put<00:00:28.289> the

corner here you can stop and put the
needle<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:32.300> pivot<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
needle in and and pivot it now it's it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920 
needle in and and pivot it now it's it
would<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.980> good<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:36.120> reinforce

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
would be good here to also reinforce

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.860 
would be good here to also reinforce
this<00:00:37.440> section<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.390> back<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
this section there you just go back and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.299 
this section there you just go back and
forth<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.530> that'll<00:00:40.980> give<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
forth a little bit that'll give it a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
forth a little bit that'll give it a
little<00:00:41.520> extra<00:00:41.790> strength<00:00:42.649> that's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.829> weak

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
little extra strength that's a weak

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
little extra strength that's a weak
point<00:00:44.730> anytime<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> real<00:00:45.960> sharp<00:00:46.440> turn

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
point anytime you have a real sharp turn

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.279 
point anytime you have a real sharp turn
in<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.579> stuffed<00:00:48.090> animal<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> weak<00:00:48.930> point

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
in a stuffed animal that's a weak point

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
in a stuffed animal that's a weak point
so<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.039> good<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
so it's good to do a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:04.049 
so it's good to do a little
reinforcement<00:00:51.210> there

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.000 

and<00:01:05.059> I'm<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:05.450> checking<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:05.990> make<00:01:06.170> sure<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.620> see

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
and I'm just checking to make sure I see

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.550 
and I'm just checking to make sure I see
that<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:07.460> shifted<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.090> little<00:01:08.360> here<00:01:08.600> that's

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
that it's shifted a little here that's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.920 
that it's shifted a little here that's
likely<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.130> happen<00:01:10.250> I'm<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:11.270> checking<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
likely to happen I'm just checking to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.310 
likely to happen I'm just checking to
make<00:01:12.050> sure<00:01:12.230> that<00:01:13.040> I'm<00:01:13.490> sewing<00:01:14.180> on<00:01:14.300> both<00:01:14.660> pieces

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
make sure that I'm sewing on both pieces

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.690 
make sure that I'm sewing on both pieces
of<00:01:15.650> fabric<00:01:20.650> okay<00:01:21.650> when<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.010> come<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> end

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
of fabric okay when you come to the end

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.280 
of fabric okay when you come to the end
you<00:01:22.850> want<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.120> do<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.300> little<00:01:23.540> back<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.990> forth

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
you want to do a little back and forth

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.290 
you want to do a little back and forth
to<00:01:24.740> knot<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.700> there<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:27.500> trim<00:01:28.300> those

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
to knot it there and just trim those

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.760 
to knot it there and just trim those
threads<00:01:30.250> now<00:01:31.690> it's<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.870> good<00:01:33.020> idea<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.740> just

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
threads now it's a good idea to just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.870 
threads now it's a good idea to just
lightly<00:01:34.670> snip<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:37.130> sharp<00:01:37.970> corner<00:01:38.060> area<00:01:39.880> just

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
lightly snip this sharp corner area just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
lightly snip this sharp corner area just
a<00:01:41.060> little<00:01:41.300> bit<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:42.560> cut<00:01:43.010> into

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
a little bit like that don't cut into

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.490 
a little bit like that don't cut into
the<00:01:43.670> threads<00:01:44.060> don't<00:01:44.300> cut<00:01:44.690> into<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.050> seam<00:01:45.290> but

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the threads don't cut into the seam but

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the threads don't cut into the seam but
cut<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.250> fabric<00:01:46.580> very<00:01:47.300> close<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:49.220> where<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
cut the fabric very close to where the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.580 
cut the fabric very close to where the
seam<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.270> that'll<00:01:50.479> help<00:01:50.690> when<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.380> go<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
seam is and that'll help when you go to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.380 
seam is and that'll help when you go to
turn<00:01:52.040> your<00:01:52.880> horse<00:01:54.490> okay<00:01:55.520> next<00:01:55.820> we're<00:01:55.970> going<00:01:56.119> to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
turn your horse okay next we're going to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.850 
turn your horse okay next we're going to
turn<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.170> head<00:01:58.100> right<00:01:58.520> side<00:01:58.820> out
