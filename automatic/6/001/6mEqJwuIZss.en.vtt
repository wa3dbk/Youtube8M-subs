00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
bit right and this is actually my first

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.340 
bit right and this is actually my first
time<00:02:20.090> doing<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.500> person<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:23.570> as<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.170> can

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
time doing it on a person so as you can

time doing it on a person so as you can
see<00:02:24.680> my<00:02:25.130> part<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.940> not<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.540> street<00:02:27.430> because

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
see my part is not that street because

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.199 
see my part is not that street because
the<00:02:28.459> tracks<00:02:29.150> they<00:02:29.840> were<00:02:29.900> sliding<00:02:30.910> because<00:02:31.910> I

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the tracks they were sliding because I

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
the tracks they were sliding because I
guess<00:02:32.390> maybe<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.750> put<00:02:32.989> too<00:02:33.019> much<00:02:33.260> glue<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.950> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
guess maybe I put too much glue on it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.130 
guess maybe I put too much glue on it
