i'm going to show you two different

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.680 
i'm going to show you two different
spirals<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.300> guy<00:00:54.510> right

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
spirals you can see on this guy right

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.130 
spirals you can see on this guy right
here<00:00:54.750> we've<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:56.449> closed-loop<00:00:57.449> spiral

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
here we've got a closed-loop spiral

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
here we've got a closed-loop spiral
we're<00:00:58.409> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.589> cover<00:00:58.769> that<00:00:58.949> second<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
we're going to cover that second and a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.969 
we're going to cover that second and a
spiral<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.690> loop<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:01.530> middle<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
spiral with a loop in the middle and

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.709 
spiral with a loop in the middle and
open<00:01:02.370> loop<00:01:02.550> let's<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.120> started<00:01:03.179> with<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
open loop let's get started with that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
open loop let's get started with that
one<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> traditional<00:01:05.369> spiral<00:01:05.880> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
one that's the traditional spiral that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.499 
one that's the traditional spiral that
most<00:01:06.509> beginning<00:01:07.020> wirework<00:01:07.470> classes<00:01:07.950> cover

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
most beginning wirework classes cover

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.789 
most beginning wirework classes cover
that's<00:01:09.509> where<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> start<00:01:09.899> with<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.530> round

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that's where you start with your round

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
that's where you start with your round
nose<00:01:10.890> pliers<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.670> here's<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.000> round<00:01:12.180> nose

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
nose pliers so here's your round nose

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
nose pliers so here's your round nose
round<00:01:12.930> tips<00:01:15.409> before<00:01:16.409> starting<00:01:17.130> though<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
round tips before starting though you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.639 
round tips before starting though you
want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> cut<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> edge<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.049> wire<00:01:19.320> with

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
want to cut the edge of this wire with

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.230 
want to cut the edge of this wire with
your<00:01:19.799> flush<00:01:20.039> cut<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.149> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
your flush cut because you're going to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
your flush cut because you're going to
be<00:01:21.360> holding<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.649> bit<00:01:23.039> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
be holding on to the very last bit you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
be holding on to the very last bit you
want<00:01:23.819> to<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:23.940> sure<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.869> wire

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
want to make sure that the end your wire

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.749 
want to make sure that the end your wire
is<00:01:25.229> cut<00:01:25.440> flush<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.369> slide

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
is cut flush so you don't just slide

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.809 
is cut flush so you don't just slide
right<00:01:26.789> off<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.289> your<00:01:28.440> cutters<00:01:28.799> using<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
right off so with your cutters using the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.279 
right off so with your cutters using the
flush<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.330> your<00:01:30.420> cutter<00:01:30.630> cut<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> small

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
flush out of your cutter cut the small

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.399 
flush out of your cutter cut the small
spit<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.830> as<00:01:32.130> possible<00:01:35.030> now<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.869> start

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
spit off as possible now where you start

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
spit off as possible now where you start
on<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.979> round<00:01:38.220> nose<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.700> determine<00:01:39.149> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
on your round nose will determine the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
on your round nose will determine the
size<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> loop<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.709> middle<00:01:41.069> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
size of the loop in the middle of the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
size of the loop in the middle of the
spiral<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.319> one<00:01:43.590> obviously<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
spiral so that this one obviously is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.809 
spiral so that this one obviously is
quite<00:01:44.789> big<00:01:45.060> or<00:01:45.959> this<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.429> one<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.789> a

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
quite big or this one and this one is a

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.029 
quite big or this one and this one is a
little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.209> smaller<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.899> where<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.679> start<00:01:49.950> on

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
little bit smaller so where you start on

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.010 
little bit smaller so where you start on
your<00:01:50.159> round<00:01:50.340> nose<00:01:50.429> will<00:01:50.759> determine<00:01:51.209> that<00:01:51.360> I'm

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
your round nose will determine that I'm

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
your round nose will determine that I'm
going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> start<00:01:52.439> right<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:55.310> grab<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to start right about here grab the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.959 
going to start right about here grab the
wire<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.920> want<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.280> sure<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.789> wire

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
wire you want to make sure that the wire

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
wire you want to make sure that the wire
is<00:02:00.240> within<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> jaw<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.109> your<00:02:01.320> pliers<00:02:01.530> just

is within the jaw of your pliers just

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.880 
is within the jaw of your pliers just
like<00:02:02.250> making<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.759> basic<00:02:03.149> loop<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.469> poking

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like making a basic loop if it's poking

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.459 
like making a basic loop if it's poking
up<00:02:05.039> at<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.579> even<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.320> like

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
up at all even just a little bit like

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.069 
up at all even just a little bit like
that<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.759> feel<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> scratch<00:02:09.299> you'll

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
that so we can feel it scratch you'll

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.170 
that so we can feel it scratch you'll
make<00:02:10.350> like<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> teardrop<00:02:11.130> shape<00:02:11.549> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.850> middle

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
make like a teardrop shape in the middle

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
make like a teardrop shape in the middle
and<00:02:12.390> because<00:02:13.079> you're<00:02:13.230> basing<00:02:13.560> your<00:02:13.590> entire

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and because you're basing your entire

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.430 
and because you're basing your entire
spiral<00:02:14.310> around<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.910> center<00:02:15.510> loop<00:02:15.810> you'll

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
spiral around that center loop you'll

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.560 
spiral around that center loop you'll
make<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.829> teardrop<00:02:17.250> shape<00:02:17.430> spiral<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
make a teardrop shape spiral so to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.050 
make a teardrop shape spiral so to
ensure<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.019> it's<00:02:19.320> round<00:02:19.730> hold<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> wire

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
ensure that it's round hold the wire

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.420 
ensure that it's round hold the wire
within<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> jaw<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> pliers<00:02:22.200> feeling<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.250> top

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
within the jaw the pliers feeling on top

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.819 
within the jaw the pliers feeling on top
making<00:02:23.700> sure<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.209> scratchy<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.049> just

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
making sure it's not scratchy and just

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.620 
making sure it's not scratchy and just
like<00:02:25.980> again<00:02:26.370> making<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.730> basic<00:02:26.880> loop<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.450> want

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
like again making a basic loop you want

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.199 
like again making a basic loop you want
to<00:02:27.720> roll<00:02:27.870> away<00:02:28.170> from<00:02:28.440> yourself<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.090> going

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
to roll away from yourself so I'm going

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.090 
to roll away from yourself so I'm going
to<00:02:30.239> hold<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> wire<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.319> press<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:31.950> my

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
to hold the wire here and press with my

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.099 
to hold the wire here and press with my
thumb<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:32.609> it<00:02:33.000> comes<00:02:33.209> around<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.810> make<00:02:34.079> sure

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
thumb as it comes around to make sure

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.140 
thumb as it comes around to make sure
that<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.680> takes<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.310> shape<00:02:35.579> roll

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that it really takes on that shape roll

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.729 
that it really takes on that shape roll
away<00:02:36.390> from<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.750> until<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.109> get<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.470> half

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
away from you until you get about a half

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.039 
away from you until you get about a half
a<00:02:37.890> turn<00:02:38.100> maybe<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.850> couple<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.209> scoots<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.750> turn

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
a turn maybe a couple of scoots now turn

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.370 
a turn maybe a couple of scoots now turn
so<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.840> really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
so you can see it this way and I really

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
so you can see it this way and I really
watch<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.010> come<00:02:44.190> around<00:02:44.489> when<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.880> about

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
watch it come around when it's about

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.650 
watch it come around when it's about
halfway<00:02:45.359> around<00:02:46.489> shift<00:02:47.489> your<00:02:47.700> hand<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.209> shift

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
halfway around shift your hand and shift

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
halfway around shift your hand and shift
your<00:02:48.780> fingers<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.709> way<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.280> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
your fingers out this way so that it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.670 
your fingers out this way so that it
comes<00:02:50.670> around<00:02:51.060> really<00:02:51.660> wide<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.639> then<00:02:53.639> tucks

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
comes around really wide and then tucks

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.559 
comes around really wide and then tucks
once<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.859> overlapped<00:02:56.400> you're<00:02:57.180> pretty<00:02:57.420> much

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
once it's overlapped you're pretty much

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.089 
once it's overlapped you're pretty much
down<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:58.019> your<00:02:58.110> done<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.739> your<00:02:58.890> round<00:02:59.040> nose

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
down with your done with your round nose

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.620 
down with your done with your round nose
pick<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.549> your<00:02:59.670> chain<00:02:59.879> nose

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
pick up your chain nose

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.140 
pick up your chain nose
and<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.410> want<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.650> hold<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.070> within<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.940> jaw

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and you want to hold this within the jaw

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.860 
and you want to hold this within the jaw
of<00:03:03.330> your<00:03:03.540> pliers<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.400> hold<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.270> back<00:03:06.420> here

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
of your pliers so I hold it back here

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.140 
of your pliers so I hold it back here
towards<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.800> box<00:03:08.010> joint<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.700> that's<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
towards a box joint because that's the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.400 
towards a box joint because that's the
strongest<00:03:09.360> part<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.810> my<00:03:09.870> tool<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.080> don't<00:03:10.320> have

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
strongest part of my tool I don't have

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.440 
strongest part of my tool I don't have
to<00:03:10.560> squeeze<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:11.100> hard<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.730> then<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.330> run

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to squeeze as hard and then I don't run

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.510 
to squeeze as hard and then I don't run
the<00:03:12.570> risk<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.930> marring<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.380> wire<00:03:13.650> because<00:03:14.400> I'm

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
the risk of marring the wire because I'm

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.330 
the risk of marring the wire because I'm
squeezing<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.120> hard<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.600> back<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:16.230> don't<00:03:17.070> let

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
squeezing so hard so back here don't let

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
squeezing so hard so back here don't let
the<00:03:17.820> whole<00:03:18.120> thing<00:03:18.150> stick<00:03:18.690> out<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.990> side<00:03:19.230> but

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the whole thing stick out the side but

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.590 
the whole thing stick out the side but
don't<00:03:19.710> hide<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.010> either<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:21.060> let<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.330> sides

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
don't hide it either just let the sides

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.540 
don't hide it either just let the sides
stick<00:03:22.050> out<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.590> you're<00:03:22.770> working<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.340> see

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
stick out that you're working on see

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.550 
stick out that you're working on see
that<00:03:23.700> little<00:03:23.850> bit<00:03:24.150> right<00:03:24.360> there<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:25.080> with<00:03:25.350> my

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that little bit right there and with my

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.400 
that little bit right there and with my

thumb I scoot shift scoot shift the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.470 
thumb I scoot shift scoot shift the
bigger<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> spiral<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.490> harder<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.030> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
bigger the spiral the harder it is to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
bigger the spiral the harder it is to
keep<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.070> uniform<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.960> why<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.230> want

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
keep it uniform but that's why you want

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.670 
keep it uniform but that's why you want
to<00:03:40.590> move<00:03:40.710> slow<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:42.140> don't<00:03:43.140> try<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.380> get

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to move slow like this don't try to get

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.070 
to move slow like this don't try to get
all<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.340> way<00:03:44.460> from<00:03:44.520> here<00:03:45.120> all<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.390> way<00:03:45.900> around

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
all the way from here all the way around

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.480 
all the way from here all the way around
to<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.440> top<00:03:46.680> because<00:03:46.950> you're<00:03:47.130> likely<00:03:47.340> going

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
to the top because you're likely going

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.090 
to the top because you're likely going
to<00:03:47.670> lose<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.870> tiny<00:03:49.170> little<00:03:49.470> scoot<00:03:49.800> see

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
to lose it just do tiny little scoot see

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.580 
to lose it just do tiny little scoot see
how<00:03:50.220> slowly<00:03:50.550> I'm<00:03:50.820> moving<00:03:51.180> again<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.230> don't<00:03:52.470> have

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
how slowly I'm moving again I don't have

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.930 
how slowly I'm moving again I don't have
the<00:03:52.710> whole<00:03:52.860> spiral<00:03:53.130> sticking<00:03:53.580> out<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.670> that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the whole spiral sticking out like that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.400 
the whole spiral sticking out like that
because<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.270> harder<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.570> hold<00:03:54.840> still<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
because it's harder to hold still and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.530 
because it's harder to hold still and
it's<00:03:55.650> harder<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.950> control<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.210> don't<00:03:57.390> have

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it's harder to control and I don't have

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.800 
it's harder to control and I don't have
the<00:03:57.660> whole<00:03:57.780> thing<00:03:57.930> hiding<00:03:58.380> either<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.480> little

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
the whole thing hiding either so little

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.300 
the whole thing hiding either so little
scoots<00:04:03.260> running<00:04:04.260> out<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.410> wire<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.190> how

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
scoots running out of wire here so how

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.640 
scoots running out of wire here so how
about<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.550> turn<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.940> into<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.210> charm<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.470> take

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
about I turn it into a charm I just take

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.440 
about I turn it into a charm I just take
my<00:04:07.680> flush<00:04:08.070> cut<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.980> with<00:04:11.160> my<00:04:11.310> round<00:04:11.550> nose<00:04:11.670> make

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
my flush cut and with my round nose make

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.380 
my flush cut and with my round nose make
a<00:04:12.480> little<00:04:12.810> bit<00:04:12.960> bigger<00:04:13.170> loop<00:04:13.410> here<00:04:14.240> roll<00:04:15.240> away

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
a little bit bigger loop here roll away

lighten up your grip when you hold that
spiral<00:04:49.830> still<00:04:50.190> you'd<00:04:50.490> be<00:04:50.640> surprised<00:04:51.120> at<00:04:51.510> how

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
spiral still you'd be surprised at how

spiral still you'd be surprised at how
lightly<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.580> can<00:04:53.760> hold<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.300> where<00:04:54.750> it's<00:04:54.930> still

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
lightly you can hold it where it's still

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.990 
lightly you can hold it where it's still
stabilizing<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.190> can<00:04:56.340> bend<00:04:56.550> around<00:04:56.700> a

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
stabilizing it so you can bend around a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.430 
stabilizing it so you can bend around a
lot<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.240> times<00:04:57.450> people<00:04:57.660> starting<00:04:58.170> out<00:04:58.260> with<00:04:58.380> a

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
lot of times people starting out with a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.410 
lot of times people starting out with a
new<00:04:58.680> technique<00:04:59.280> give<00:04:59.850> it<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.060> death<00:05:00.240> grip

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
new technique give it the death grip

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.750 
new technique give it the death grip
just<00:05:00.990> lighten<00:05:01.200> up<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.500> little<00:05:01.620> bit<00:05:01.860> okay<00:05:02.610> now

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
just lighten up a little bit okay now

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.650 
just lighten up a little bit okay now
I'm<00:05:02.820> going<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.030> show<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.300> closed-loop

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
loop with your chain nose so we're not

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.450 
loop with your chain nose so we're not
making<00:05:24.139> an<00:05:24.259> open<00:05:24.500> circle<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.099> inside<00:05:25.430> of

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
little kink to bend around from there so

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.730 
little kink to bend around from there so
for<00:05:32.479> this<00:05:32.629> you<00:05:32.930> want<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.110> make<00:05:33.259> sure<00:05:33.289> you<00:05:33.590> have

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
for this you want to make sure you have

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.920 
for this you want to make sure you have
a<00:05:33.800> pretty<00:05:34.099> fine<00:05:34.430> tipped<00:05:34.819> chain<00:05:35.300> those<00:05:35.539> grab

that you can grab with the smallest part

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.140 
that you can grab with the smallest part
of<00:05:41.000> your<00:05:41.060> chain<00:05:41.389> nose<00:05:41.419> and<00:05:42.490> roll<00:05:43.490> it<00:05:43.669> around<00:05:43.759> as

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.409 
of your chain nose and roll it around as
if<00:05:44.330> making<00:05:44.539> a<00:05:44.780> basic<00:05:44.930> loop<00:05:45.879> but<00:05:46.879> just<00:05:47.180> come

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
if making a basic loop but just come

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.959 
if making a basic loop but just come
around<00:05:47.569> till<00:05:48.259> halfway<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.219> it's<00:05:49.610> like<00:05:49.789> a

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
around till halfway so it's like a

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.050 
around till halfway so it's like a
little<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.659> or<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.860> see<00:05:52.219> depending<00:05:52.759> which<00:05:52.879> way

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
little you or a see depending which way

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.089 
little you or a see depending which way
you're<00:05:53.180> looking<00:05:53.419> at<00:05:53.539> it<00:05:53.690> now<00:05:54.500> here's<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.740> tricky

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
you're looking at it now here's a tricky

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.240 
you're looking at it now here's a tricky
part<00:05:56.139> instead<00:05:57.139> of<00:05:57.199> coming<00:05:57.560> in<00:05:57.590> with<00:05:57.830> my<00:05:57.949> plier

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
part instead of coming in with my plier

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.869 
part instead of coming in with my plier
let<00:05:58.669> me<00:05:58.759> get<00:05:58.909> closer<00:05:59.120> here<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.800> just<00:06:01.129> smashing

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
let me get closer here and just smashing

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.520 
let me get closer here and just smashing
right<00:06:02.060> there<00:06:02.300> that<00:06:02.479> would<00:06:02.659> make<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:02.840> long<00:06:03.229> and

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
right there that would make it long and

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.570 
right there that would make it long and
pointed<00:06:04.039> I'm<00:06:04.250> going<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.639> come<00:06:04.849> like<00:06:05.330> this<00:06:06.580> do

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
pointed I'm going to come like this do

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.760 
pointed I'm going to come like this do
you<00:06:07.669> see<00:06:07.849> how<00:06:08.000> now<00:06:08.240> I've<00:06:08.569> got<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:09.229> part<00:06:09.590> of<00:06:09.680> my

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
you see how now I've got this part of my

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.390 
you see how now I've got this part of my
tool<00:06:10.009> on<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.909> tail<00:06:11.750> and<00:06:12.080> this<00:06:12.680> in<00:06:12.919> the<00:06:13.009> back<00:06:13.190> of

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
tool on the tail and this in the back of

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.700 
tool on the tail and this in the back of
the<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:13.789> it's<00:06:14.599> not<00:06:14.750> wanting<00:06:15.050> to<00:06:15.080> focus<00:06:15.500> right

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
the you it's not wanting to focus right

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.320 
the you it's not wanting to focus right
on<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:16.009> wire<00:06:16.219> in<00:06:16.430> my<00:06:16.580> tool<00:06:16.789> but<00:06:16.969> I<00:06:17.000> think<00:06:17.240> you

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
on that wire in my tool but I think you

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.719 
on that wire in my tool but I think you
can<00:06:17.479> see<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:17.870> there<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.380> by<00:06:19.009> doing<00:06:19.219> that<00:06:19.370> I'm

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
can see it there and by doing that I'm

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.850 
can see it there and by doing that I'm
going<00:06:19.849> to<00:06:19.940> tuck<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:20.599> again<00:06:20.870> not<00:06:21.259> like<00:06:21.500> this

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
going to tuck it so again not like this

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.820 
going to tuck it so again not like this
that<00:06:22.370> will<00:06:22.520> just<00:06:22.699> make<00:06:22.759> it<00:06:22.880> long<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.300> squished

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
that will just make it long and squished

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.990 
that will just make it long and squished
but<00:06:24.830> like<00:06:25.190> this<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:27.069> squeeze<00:06:28.069> and<00:06:28.490> it<00:06:28.909> will

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
but like this and squeeze and it will

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.260 
but like this and squeeze and it will
tuck<00:06:29.240> it<00:06:29.389> into<00:06:29.539> a<00:06:29.690> tiny<00:06:30.020> little<00:06:30.259> kink<00:06:31.090> see<00:06:32.090> that

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
tuck it into a tiny little kink see that

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.080 
tuck it into a tiny little kink see that
little<00:06:32.389> kink<00:06:32.750> now<00:06:33.560> treat<00:06:33.919> that<00:06:34.129> like<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:34.849> loop

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
little kink now treat that like the loop

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.879 
little kink now treat that like the loop
that<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.389> did<00:06:35.599> before<00:06:35.750> where<00:06:36.289> you<00:06:36.319> hold<00:06:36.710> it

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
that you did before where you hold it

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.100 
that you did before where you hold it
within<00:06:37.069> the<00:06:37.279> chain<00:06:37.550> nose<00:06:37.759> and<00:06:39.039> build<00:06:40.039> your

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
within the chain nose and build your

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.309 
within the chain nose and build your
spiral<00:06:42.110> around<00:06:42.379> it<00:06:43.690> now<00:06:44.690> this<00:06:44.840> guy<00:06:45.050> you<00:06:45.110> have

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
spiral around it now this guy you have

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.629 
spiral around it now this guy you have
to<00:06:45.440> squeeze<00:06:45.650> pretty<00:06:46.009> hard<00:06:46.250> to<00:06:46.370> hold<00:06:46.460> them

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
to squeeze pretty hard to hold them

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.309 
to squeeze pretty hard to hold them
still<00:06:46.879> when<00:06:47.060> first<00:06:47.330> starting<00:06:47.659> it<00:06:47.750> out<00:06:47.870> so<00:06:48.229> it

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
still when first starting it out so it

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:59.090 
still when first starting it out so it
almost<00:06:48.440> looks<00:06:48.710> like<00:06:48.800> you<00:06:49.009> hammered<00:06:49.430> it

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.560 

that's<00:06:59.730> working<00:07:00.180> out<00:07:00.270> pretty<00:07:00.480> good<00:07:02.420> now<00:07:03.420> if

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
that's working out pretty good now if

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.730 
that's working out pretty good now if
you<00:07:03.660> wanted<00:07:03.990> to<00:07:04.170> make<00:07:04.410> something<00:07:04.880> like<00:07:05.880> this

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
you wanted to make something like this

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.700 
you wanted to make something like this
or<00:07:07.740> actually<00:07:07.980> more<00:07:08.430> like<00:07:08.580> this<00:07:08.850> guy<00:07:08.910> here<00:07:09.710> you

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
or actually more like this guy here you

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.920 
or actually more like this guy here you
could<00:07:10.890> build<00:07:11.040> a<00:07:11.340> spiral<00:07:12.090> on<00:07:12.240> the<00:07:12.480> other<00:07:12.660> end

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
could build a spiral on the other end

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.820 
could build a spiral on the other end
and<00:07:13.320> maybe<00:07:14.160> treat<00:07:14.490> it<00:07:14.640> as<00:07:14.820> a<00:07:14.850> charm<00:07:15.270> or<00:07:16.050> a<00:07:16.110> link

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
and maybe treat it as a charm or a link

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.450 
and maybe treat it as a charm or a link
in<00:07:17.370> a<00:07:18.030> necklace<00:07:18.360> or<00:07:18.480> bracelet<00:07:18.890> you<00:07:19.890> might<00:07:20.250> want

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
in a necklace or bracelet you might want

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.890 
in a necklace or bracelet you might want
to<00:07:20.520> use<00:07:20.580> a<00:07:20.640> little<00:07:20.910> thicker<00:07:21.150> gauge<00:07:21.420> wire<00:07:21.720> if

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
to use a little thicker gauge wire if

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.850 
to use a little thicker gauge wire if
you're<00:07:22.050> doing<00:07:22.290> that<00:07:23.540> here<00:07:24.540> we<00:07:24.750> go<00:07:24.930> with<00:07:25.380> the

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
you're doing that here we go with the

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:34.519 
you're doing that here we go with the
Tuck

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.420 

you

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430 
you

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.730 
you
if<00:07:37.090> you<00:07:37.210> can't<00:07:37.420> get<00:07:37.540> your<00:07:37.660> finger<00:07:38.020> up<00:07:38.200> against

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740 
if you can't get your finger up against

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.290 
if you can't get your finger up against
it<00:07:38.890> your<00:07:39.010> thumb<00:07:39.220> like<00:07:39.250> this<00:07:39.490> like<00:07:39.970> I've<00:07:40.120> been

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.300 
it your thumb like this like I've been

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.120 
it your thumb like this like I've been
doing<00:07:40.570> to<00:07:40.720> build<00:07:40.840> those<00:07:41.020> files<00:07:41.410> you<00:07:41.860> can<00:07:42.010> also

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.130 
doing to build those files you can also

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.700 
doing to build those files you can also
just<00:07:42.460> hold<00:07:42.880> this<00:07:43.090> and<00:07:43.870> give<00:07:44.110> a<00:07:44.140> little<00:07:44.230> tension

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
just hold this and give a little tension

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:52.770 
just hold this and give a little tension
that<00:07:45.040> way

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:52.780 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.430 

so<00:07:53.410> there's<00:07:53.620> just<00:07:53.920> a<00:07:54.040> quickie<00:07:54.430> with<00:07:54.580> spirals

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 
so there's just a quickie with spirals

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.240 
so there's just a quickie with spirals
remember<00:07:56.440> if<00:07:56.560> you're<00:07:56.710> getting<00:07:56.980> a<00:07:57.070> lot<00:07:57.220> of

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
remember if you're getting a lot of

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.870 
remember if you're getting a lot of
gouges<00:07:57.820> in<00:07:58.060> your<00:07:58.330> spirals<00:07:59.430> you're<00:08:00.430> squeezing

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:00.880 
gouges in your spirals you're squeezing

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.460 
gouges in your spirals you're squeezing
too<00:08:00.970> hard<00:08:01.000> with<00:08:01.330> your<00:08:01.419> chain<00:08:01.660> nose<00:08:01.690> or<00:08:02.169> you're

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470 
too hard with your chain nose or you're

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.560 
too hard with your chain nose or you're
working<00:08:02.889> with<00:08:03.010> it<00:08:03.220> cheap<00:08:03.580> old<00:08:03.790> pair<00:08:04.090> of<00:08:04.120> beat

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:04.570 
working with it cheap old pair of beat

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.290
