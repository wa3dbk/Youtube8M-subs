00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.360
 she has been photographed without a tripod in low light conditions 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 a higher sensitivity setting instructed the camera to do so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 occurring image noise must then be removed again 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 look for yourself 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.499
 we are here at the cauldron case 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.210
 the boiler case is none 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.749
 Source blown up the mountain 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.170
 and already have something 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.630
 We started this morning 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 really nice weather with sunshine 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.130
 but this island is one 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.610
 hands-on but happen relatively quickly 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.440
 that you look 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 cloudy days, the plus is 40 cloudy 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.760
 just like there are cadres right now 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.950
 that means 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 that's Peter enough as you see city stopped 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.100
 In this respect, it is achieved that a task of these is here 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 probably need a relatively soon closed aperture 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.640
 of course, what I can do is Manning childishness 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.020
 Camera upwards 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.040
 So not with miracles to photograph 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.450
 depending on what I need 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.850
 that is not a problem yet 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.150
 This is also the case with most cameras, but if you go further on the soap 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.580
 hundred 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.870
 150 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.310
 then it will probably already be like guessing a certain noise 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 If I want to do this again, there must be some noise 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 calculate 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240
 sunny but not deter the ethereal ways and means 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 calculate again later 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 now I have to get her point out of here 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.180
 Far missing zoom on the camera from 15 to 20 millimeters 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 I'm going to a focal length of 20 millimeters around these lines 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.090
 this game is here too 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.680
 and look at it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.330
 could work 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.470
 Thinklogical was not always a bit of a joke 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 around these two early woods here too so that the brain has wooden huts with it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.509
 to see that is a certain 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 Structure the whole 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.239
 and you've already heard that 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 is hopelessly overcrowded with 125 5 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.979
 until the break they delivered to a value of 51 seconds 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.369
 what do we do 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 Change Dirk 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.099
 if you assume that you are so with her 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.399
 Hosting caring brunch can work free 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.399
 that's what the Fender of the lander looks like and needs here 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:44.949
 to get out of hand 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.389
 working well can work comfortably 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.959
 around 3200 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.519
 that's definitely going to happen 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.819
 intoxicated 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.789
 There are two types of noise 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.769
 the one is that 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 Introduce pastor 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.629
 finally the himself 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.949
 it is less at approx 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.829
 the second 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.539
 for research 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.199
 different 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.199
 the PC but a whole 14 points 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.649
 almost analog 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 Place Valdano 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.439
 User of partial hotel 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.139
 earlier referred to as women 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.959
 in the first place 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.889
 the listener feeling 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.709
 exactly this way then one can stop here on only that we now the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.539
 Possibility to save the house 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.169
 as that happens if I do not have a tripod with me but still 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.109
 I have to do that 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.809
 calculate ahead 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.219
 in Photoshop can 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.749
 Minimize sensitivity, so to speak, or the 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.599
 Effects of an apartment 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.379
 thought through removing the image section
