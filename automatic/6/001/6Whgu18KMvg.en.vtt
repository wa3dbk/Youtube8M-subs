 passers-by on a pocket electric pole 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.530
 on the choice of the victim depends on the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.090
 reputation for the Russian name of the game in any 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.909
 the moment you can fall upon the group and

 on the back 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.549
 what does reputation mean 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.189
 harder even if you are trying your best 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.159

 land is another quarter of the city 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.870
 smog defeated armed enemies not 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.120
 kill mercifully bound hands and

 your legs will still have nightmares with them 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.569
 all sides 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.980
 helping the careless 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.030
 demining police officer bombs 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.079
 you can turn the corner in a minute and 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.340
 snatch under the squad of gibadadshnikov 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.950
 who don't care about your reputation and 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.540
 all your deeds the same thing happens 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030
 during massive skirmishes 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.260
 wedged between rival 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 militia cops get in the end 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 will have hugs and a number of other videos 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.799
 hiding mcgrant subscribers 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.730
 miraculous on rolls announce each other 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.340
 unspoken 3 world and don't focus 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.799
 will stay on the main character in the final 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.099
 after a couple of hours it is all very 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.730
 wear down anybody and desire to be expelled 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.560
 with battle tactics and fight in general 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.769
 no easier to jump on 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.199
 tram wires and move away from enemies 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.789
 away she works 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.359
 what more 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.759
 only three cases transferred 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.009
 he 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.909
 but her 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:18.939
 January 2 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.699
 so it was obvious you don't understand 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.930
 as far as all 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.930
 so what's going on here 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.609
 the situation with monsters is more common 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.430
 altogether they go in groups and so 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.829
 strongly what the hero says flies away 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.059
 a few meters in the direction better climbed 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.369
 on the roof shoot mutant sensations 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.729
 in close combat arguing with them practically 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.159
 useless 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.589
 at the start and ride over the roofs of lamppost 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.999
 pillars and architectural 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.180
 monument to the fictional city 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.019
 very exciting 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.799
 in infamous 2 all the tricks are decorated counter 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.019
 in general they are the main value 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.389
 games and at the same time its main problem 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.730
 because in Transcarpathia kayfuyu 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.400
 passers are no more so as 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.290
 then correct this misunderstanding 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.669
 developers have introduced into the game 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.249
 editor allows you to create 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.570
 own missions 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.520
 they spread by the hanged 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.230
 randomly appears on 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.189
 global map if you are connected to a network 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.279
 that big choice for fantasy u 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.659
 traditional combat missions before set their 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.389
 slurred races but with other qualities 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.809
 infomat you the very fact of having an editor in 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.319
 the game looks like a cheap authors attempt 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.069
 win public attention 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.680
 but I like the game 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 make your
