00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
hello guys and welcome to another video

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.090 
hello guys and welcome to another video
today<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:43.930> have<00:00:44.930> an<00:00:45.140> updated<00:00:45.590> version<00:00:45.860> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
today I have an updated version of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.840 
today I have an updated version of
something<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:47.210> did<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:48.020> past<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:49.580> with

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
something I did in the past but now with

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.740 
something I did in the past but now with
the<00:00:49.970> new<00:00:50.620> 1.8<00:00:51.620> snapshots<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.550> everything<00:00:52.910> you

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
the new 1.8 snapshots and everything you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.250 
the new 1.8 snapshots and everything you
can<00:00:54.020> make<00:00:54.380> this<00:00:54.680> quick<00:00:55.370> time<00:00:55.670> event<00:00:55.970> effect<00:00:56.840> a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
can make this quick time event effect a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.300 
can make this quick time event effect a
lot<00:00:57.890> more<00:00:58.370> nicely<00:00:59.770> before<00:01:00.770> I<00:01:00.980> was<00:01:01.130> using

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
lot more nicely before I was using

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.930 
lot more nicely before I was using
snowballs<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.330> like<00:01:03.320> putting<00:01:03.650> them<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.880> a

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
snowballs and like putting them in in a

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.230 
snowballs and like putting them in in a
certain<00:01:05.150> order<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.710> can<00:01:07.160> just<00:01:07.520> test

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
certain order but now you can just test

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.540 
certain order but now you can just test
it<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.600> an<00:01:08.780> uneven<00:01:09.110> slot<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:10.250> will<00:01:10.430> be

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
it for an uneven slot that will be

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.930 
it for an uneven slot that will be
selected<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.050> I'll<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.470> show<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.710> how<00:01:13.220> that

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
selected so I'll just show you how that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.170 
selected so I'll just show you how that
all<00:01:14.450> worked<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.440> pretty<00:01:15.680> simple<00:01:16.180> even

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
all worked it's pretty simple even

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.960 
all worked it's pretty simple even
though<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.300> looks<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.600> little<00:01:17.720> complicated<00:01:17.990> but

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
though it looks a little complicated but

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.469 
though it looks a little complicated but
it<00:01:19.970> basically<00:01:20.090> tests<00:01:20.900> for<00:01:21.200> where<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.800> are<00:01:21.950> so

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
it basically tests for where you are so

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.230 
it basically tests for where you are so
right<00:01:23.479> here<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> have<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.940> testing<00:01:25.940> for<00:01:25.970> right

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
right here I have it testing for right

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.140 
right here I have it testing for right
there<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:28.490> might<00:01:28.670> have<00:01:28.700> seen<00:01:29.000> this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
there and then you might have seen this

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.320 
there and then you might have seen this
in<00:01:29.390> one<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.840> movies<00:01:30.380> videos<00:01:30.950> I'll<00:01:31.790> also

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
in one of the movies videos I'll also

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.240 
in one of the movies videos I'll also
put<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.750> note<00:01:33.020> description<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.100> it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
put that note description but it

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.200 
put that note description but it
basically<00:01:34.400> has<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.119> do<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:35.830> teleporting

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
basically has to do with teleporting

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.529 
basically has to do with teleporting
players<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.509> entities<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.619> make<00:01:40.179> them<00:01:41.179> look<00:01:41.390> a

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
players to entities to make them look a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.400 
players to entities to make them look a
certain<00:01:41.869> direction

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
certain direction

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.060 
certain direction
so<00:01:44.170> I'll<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:46.300> disconnect<00:01:47.300> I'll<00:01:48.289> show<00:01:48.530> you

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
so I'll just disconnect I'll show you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.719 
so I'll just disconnect I'll show you
so<00:01:49.940> once<00:01:50.090> I'm<00:01:50.300> stuck<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.399> look<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.580> that

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
so once I'm stuck here I look in that

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.940 
so once I'm stuck here I look in that
direction<00:01:52.940> even<00:01:53.810> though<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.140> was<00:01:54.440> looking<00:01:54.800> this

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
direction even though I was looking this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.700 
direction even though I was looking this
way<00:01:55.009> before<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.050> basically<00:01:57.050> once<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.530> get

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
way before so basically once you get

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
way before so basically once you get
into<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.039> area<00:01:58.220> it'll<00:01:58.880> make<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.300> look

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
into that area it'll make you look

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.750 
into that area it'll make you look
to<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.420> right<00:02:01.620> well<00:02:02.620> that<00:02:02.740> slowness<00:02:03.310> 10

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
to the right well that slowness 10

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.750 
to the right well that slowness 10
here's<00:02:04.720> jump<00:02:04.990> boost<00:02:05.260> 200<00:02:05.830> which<00:02:06.010> makes<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.610> so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
here's jump boost 200 which makes it so

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.410 
here's jump boost 200 which makes it so
you<00:02:06.880> can't<00:02:06.940> jump<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.920> here<00:02:09.460> just<00:02:09.820> summons<00:02:10.210> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you can't jump and here just summons the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.140 
you can't jump and here just summons the
zombie<00:02:10.810> right<00:02:10.990> there<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:12.610> tells<00:02:12.850> you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
zombie right there and it tells you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.510 
zombie right there and it tells you
which<00:02:14.490> slot<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.790> select<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:16.960> hot<00:02:17.170> pot<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
which slot to select in your hot pot and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.190 
which slot to select in your hot pot and
you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.820> do<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.150> any<00:02:19.360> way<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.540> want<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.960> just

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you can do this any way you want I just

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.400 
you can do this any way you want I just
decided<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.920> put<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> numbers<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.000> words

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
decided to put the numbers and the words

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.760 
decided to put the numbers and the words
just<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.850> whichever<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:25.180> makes<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.350> think<00:02:26.590> of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
just so whichever one makes you think of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.390 
just so whichever one makes you think of
which<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.850> press<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.540> guess<00:02:28.720> faster

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
which you have to press I guess faster

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.150 
which you have to press I guess faster
so<00:02:30.400> also<00:02:31.270> once<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.660> detects<00:02:32.020> you're<00:02:32.230> there<00:02:32.350> it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so also once it detects you're there it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.480 
so also once it detects you're there it
will<00:02:33.370> set<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> redstone<00:02:34.180> block<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.930> here

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
will set a redstone block right here

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.050 
will set a redstone block right here
okay<00:02:36.490> so<00:02:36.820> I'm<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.210> put<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.570> here<00:02:37.810> but

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
okay so I'm not gonna put this here but

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.090 
okay so I'm not gonna put this here but
that's<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.150> redstone<00:02:40.420> block<00:02:40.570> right<00:02:40.960> there<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that's a redstone block right there it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.810 
that's a redstone block right there it
starts<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.820> clock<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:44.290> will<00:02:44.590> test<00:02:45.580> if

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
starts this clock and this will test if

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.840 
starts this clock and this will test if
you<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.480> slot<00:02:46.900> selected<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.700> have

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
you have that slot selected and you have

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.630 
you have that slot selected and you have
to<00:02:49.000> remember<00:02:49.240> that<00:02:49.570> if<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.470> were<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.190> put<00:02:51.370> slot

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
to remember that if you were to put slot

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.290 
to remember that if you were to put slot
0<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.510> be<00:02:52.750> slot<00:02:53.290> 1<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:54.580> everything

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
0 that would be slot 1 so everything

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.110 
0 that would be slot 1 so everything
like<00:02:55.750> sock<00:02:56.020> or<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:58.270> slap<00:02:58.570> 5<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.160> once<00:03:00.910> it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
like sock or is really slap 5 so once it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.390 
like sock or is really slap 5 so once it
detects<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.230> selected<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:03.040> slot

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
detects that you have selected that slot

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.420 
detects that you have selected that slot
it<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.300> push<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.750> there<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:06.370> will

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
it will push this there and it will

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.710 
it will push this there and it will
prevent<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:07.240> from<00:03:08.220> killing<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.480> it's

kind<00:03:11.050> of<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.530> killed<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.220> zombie

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
kind of like you killed the zombie

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.410 
kind of like you killed the zombie
because<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:14.290> will<00:03:14.410> play<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.890> sound<00:03:15.270> kill<00:03:16.270> the
