00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
looks at smaller numbers below 20 now

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.839 
looks at smaller numbers below 20 now
it's<00:00:10.990> similar<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.349> another<00:00:11.589> game<00:00:12.039> another<00:00:12.610> two

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
it's similar to another game another two

it's similar to another game another two
games<00:00:13.089> I've<00:00:13.299> got<00:00:13.480> actually<00:00:14.099> could<00:00:15.099> complete

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
games I've got actually could complete

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.640 
games I've got actually could complete
me<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:15.969> one<00:00:16.420> looks<00:00:16.660> at<00:00:16.810> fractions<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.530> other

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
me and one looks at fractions the other

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.830 
me and one looks at fractions the other
at<00:00:17.860> decimals<00:00:18.310> but<00:00:18.820> this<00:00:18.970> game<00:00:19.270> is<00:00:19.330> just<00:00:19.480> for

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
at decimals but this game is just for

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.560 
at decimals but this game is just for
younger<00:00:20.050> kids<00:00:20.200> in<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.710> early<00:00:20.920> years<00:00:21.510> okay<00:00:22.510> so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
younger kids in the early years okay so

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.860 
younger kids in the early years okay so
we<00:00:22.870> start<00:00:23.230> by<00:00:23.650> thinking<00:00:24.640> of<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.180> target<00:00:25.540> number

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
we start by thinking of a target number

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.170 
we start by thinking of a target number
and<00:00:26.440> i<00:00:26.590> have<00:00:26.710> chosen<00:00:26.920> 10<00:00:27.370> for<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.760> example

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
and i have chosen 10 for this example

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.500 
and i have chosen 10 for this example
I've<00:00:28.780> also<00:00:29.080> drawn<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.530> line<00:00:29.830> with<00:00:30.250> 10<00:00:30.850> boxes<00:00:31.119> in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
I've also drawn a line with 10 boxes in

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.099 
I've also drawn a line with 10 boxes in
as<00:00:31.630> well<00:00:32.190> now<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.999> reach<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.449> target<00:00:34.600> number

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
as well now to reach this target number

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.759 
as well now to reach this target number
it's<00:00:35.589> a<00:00:35.800> two-player<00:00:36.280> game<00:00:36.899> each<00:00:37.899> player<00:00:37.960> is

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
it's a two-player game each player is

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.880 
it's a two-player game each player is
going<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.489> pick<00:00:39.819> a<00:00:40.050> certain<00:00:41.050> number<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.589> fill

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
going to pick a certain number to fill

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.020 
going to pick a certain number to fill
in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.390> target<00:00:43.839> number<00:00:44.100> boxes<00:00:45.100> with<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.879> the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
in the target number boxes with so the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.509 
in the target number boxes with so the
numbers<00:00:46.390> we<00:00:46.510> can<00:00:46.659> choose<00:00:46.960> from<00:00:47.170> our<00:00:47.409> three<00:00:47.890> two

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
numbers we can choose from our three two

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.500 
numbers we can choose from our three two
and<00:00:48.760> one<00:00:49.449> whichever<00:00:50.199> numbers<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.679> choose<00:00:51.039> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and one whichever numbers you choose it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.479 
and one whichever numbers you choose it
doesn't<00:00:52.510> really<00:00:52.629> matter<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:53.079> could<00:00:53.229> have<00:00:53.489> for

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
doesn't really matter you could have for

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.319 
doesn't really matter you could have for
two<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.269> one<00:00:55.449> or<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.899> could<00:00:56.079> have<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.699> three

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
two and one or you could have one three

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.910 
two and one or you could have one three
and<00:00:58.359> five<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:01.239> really<00:01:01.569> up<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:01.920> all

right so the aim of the game is to be
the<00:01:05.470> person<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:06.070> put<00:01:06.370> in<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.850> final<00:01:07.360> number

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
the person to put in the final number

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.880 
the person to put in the final number
and<00:01:07.930> complete<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.640> whole<00:01:10.230> group<00:01:11.230> to<00:01:11.740> reach

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
and complete the whole group to reach

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.090 
and complete the whole group to reach
the<00:01:12.100> target<00:01:12.310> number<00:01:12.640> all<00:01:13.570> right<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.590> I'm<00:01:14.620> going

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
the target number all right so I'm going

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.040 
the target number all right so I'm going
to<00:01:15.130> go<00:01:15.280> first<00:01:15.640> maybe<00:01:16.120> I'm<00:01:16.300> playing<00:01:16.570> against<00:01:16.870> my

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
to go first maybe I'm playing against my

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.780 
to go first maybe I'm playing against my
class<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.740> i'm<00:01:18.430> going<00:01:18.730> to<00:01:18.880> pick<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.710> three<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
class and i'm going to pick a three so

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.810 
class and i'm going to pick a three so
i'll<00:01:21.910> color<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.360> three<00:01:22.630> boxes<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.490> it's<00:01:27.640> my

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
i'll color in three boxes then it's my

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.490 
i'll color in three boxes then it's my
classes<00:01:28.420> turn<00:01:28.690> they're<00:01:28.990> going<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:29.260> a<00:01:29.290> bit

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
classes turn they're going to have a bit

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
classes turn they're going to have a bit
of<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.650> think<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.280> they're<00:01:31.270> going<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.870> pick<00:01:33.780> two

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of a think and they're going to pick two

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.490 
of a think and they're going to pick two
one<00:01:37.200> two

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:52.520 

or<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.270> pick<00:01:44.030> one<00:01:51.229> they're<00:01:52.229> going

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
or I'm going to pick one they're going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:02.270 
or I'm going to pick one they're going
to<00:01:52.770> pick<00:01:54.380> two

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.069 

okay<00:02:03.280> now<00:02:03.520> there's<00:02:03.700> only<00:02:03.790> two<00:02:04.180> empty<00:02:04.630> boxes

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
okay now there's only two empty boxes

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.120 
okay now there's only two empty boxes
left<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.119> can<00:02:07.360> pick<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.570> two<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.800> fill<00:02:09.009> in

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
left and so I can pick a two to fill in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.559 
left and so I can pick a two to fill in
those<00:02:09.250> empty<00:02:09.640> boxes<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:13.090> I've<00:02:13.300> put

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
those empty boxes and because I've put

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.640 
those empty boxes and because I've put
in<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.989> final<00:02:15.450> number<00:02:16.450> two<00:02:16.630> equal<00:02:17.020> 10<00:02:17.290> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
in the final number two equal 10 it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.180 
in the final number two equal 10 it
means<00:02:18.099> I've<00:02:18.489> won<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.760> game<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.959> can't<00:02:20.500> go

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
means I've won the game now you can't go

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.610 
means I've won the game now you can't go
over<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:22.180> number<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.780> example<00:02:23.170> if<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.410> if

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
over the number for example if I if

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.589 
over the number for example if I if
there<00:02:23.800> are<00:02:23.890> only<00:02:23.980> two<00:02:24.310> boxes<00:02:24.700> left<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.209> couldn't

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
there are only two boxes left I couldn't

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.550 
there are only two boxes left I couldn't
choose<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> three<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.910> would<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.560> going

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
choose a three because it would be going

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140 
choose a three because it would be going
over<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.920> 10<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.459> can't<00:02:30.700> really<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
over the 10 and you can't really do that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.780 
over the 10 and you can't really do that
well<00:02:32.140> thank<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.500> for<00:02:32.680> watching<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.160> video<00:02:33.310> I
