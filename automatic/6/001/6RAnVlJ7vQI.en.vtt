00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
great to begin with it's an interesting

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
great to begin with it's an interesting
specimen<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.380> super<00:02:04.560> super

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just nothing open then that says is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.330 
just nothing open then that says is
probably<00:02:10.259> worth<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> mean<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.160> more

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
probably worth it I mean it one more

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.589 
probably worth it I mean it one more
but<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.900> okay<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.190> bus<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.390> worst

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but it's okay not the bus not the worst

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.300 
but it's okay not the bus not the worst
I<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.319> think<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> pepperoni

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I actually think I like the pepperoni

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.619 
I actually think I like the pepperoni
version<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.670> little<00:02:17.849> bit<00:02:17.940> better<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
version a little bit better this is a

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.910 
version a little bit better this is a
little<00:02:18.870> more<00:02:18.959> simple<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.650> taste<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
little more simple you can taste the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830 
little more simple you can taste the
cheese<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.269> seems<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.569> there's<00:02:21.810> just

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
cheese this it seems like there's just

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
cheese this it seems like there's just
weird<00:02:22.220> confusing<00:02:23.220> flavors<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.670> over<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
weird confusing flavors all over the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.550 
weird confusing flavors all over the
place<00:02:24.120> not<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.720> worst<00:02:25.019> thing<00:02:25.200> ever<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.530> I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
place not the worst thing ever that I

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
place not the worst thing ever that I
would<00:02:25.769> just<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.040> us<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.160> middle<00:02:26.310> roads

would just give us the middle roads

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.000 
would just give us the middle roads
three<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.940> five<00:02:27.120> not<00:02:27.720> bad<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> worst

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
three out of five not bad not the worst

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.240 
three out of five not bad not the worst
