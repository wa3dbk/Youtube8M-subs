00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.210
 under Leonid 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello to the living community 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.880
 I want to show you such a Chinese 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 interesting type of gift option 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:23.340
 box as you can see so thick in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.109
 quality made here this knife i am i 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 I would have such a knife 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 but I have it now at work 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.230
 very active because you do not mind a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 I saw this as gift options 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 also decided to buy think so well 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:48.829
 high quality assembled knife 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.110
 Cheholchik is also quite high quality 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.110
 wear of course after big and uncomfortable 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 I do not know the lining probably jitter yet 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 you are chinese all the widgets on are doing in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 mostly well by touch and and how to say 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 small small notch 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.840
 besides being green 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 drops the map even my map reminds 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.909
 green with light streaks see 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.430
 under finger grooves such made or 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.580
 just bumps on the lining 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.550
 all collected enough quality 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.570
 solidly tight clip 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.770
 quite soft only yes normal 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.390
 clip dark hole is not very 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.190
 river enough 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 th size well as always chinese axial 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.050
 make sly well I already unscrew 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.330
 round nose pliers with curved tips 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:06.670
 Well, I caught a lady 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:11.860
 in the center of the course is not to say that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:18.450
 smooth bad axis enough excise bow 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:23.520
 tight sinks into itself under its weight 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.520
 the hatch is light but it can be tightened 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:33.040
 no axial play and lateral well has 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.650
 i will say why but the clips why that u 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.530
 I do not exactly well, is this a 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.209
 green lining for me 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.110
 ordinary simpler option with 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:50.530
 black jit n at home even at work 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:53.650
 the knife is exactly that lan or 04 of course 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.850
 the blade itself reminds us more such 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.239
 famous knives 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.320
 most likely I stole the form so 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:07.209
 I think so much on the blade is 8 chrome 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.560
 13 mobitree traditional what else about it 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.200
 knife yes as always the Chinese hits from 1 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.549
 the washer inside is brass 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.280
 and the second thin plastic which is 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.560
 I saw there is not clear why so cunning 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.600
 when can both be done but i think if 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.300
 at work I have something 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.500
 our beats that is, it is bronze 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.980
 shelf is 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.440
 Well, in the plate I will rearrange it or 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.070
 brass do not know which ones why they are more likely 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.750
 total brass not bronze what else about 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:47.450
 this is our let's see its size 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:56.750
 this knife so the total length of its kind 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.750
 total length 20 centimeters blade length 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:06.990
 almost 9 well 87 88 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.850
 the handle itself for 12 remains a little 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.490
 less than only 178 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:18.380
 I always have them in these Chinese 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.240
 but if axis lock is sure to go now 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.860
 desh kicks others on oxy they are very sharp 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.640
 tight why they are so spring up 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.620
 do I do not understand on the same whip 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.910
 the reptile is free even with one finger 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.090
 you can open 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.150
 for comparison, I had to take it 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.280
 to show how it is easy to walk from here 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:46.490
 they are very tight 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:52.000
 struggling to strain to get out 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.540
 gearing so goes of course ok 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.870
 behind . 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.920
 also very good factory right 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.880
 finger another 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:15.260
 touches so let's weigh it 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:20.630
 him the veil is it so suitable for 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.960
 Odessa wearing 140 grams decent weight 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.850
 enough i will say on your pocket it will be 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.300
 tangible where there it is and diarrhea 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.300
 shorts 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:43.660
 Then magix blue pink lightweight wear 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:48.110
 it weighs 85 grams the same tank 112 k-lite 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.930
 95 grams although declared 100 and weighs 95 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.540
 only him why i weigh myself always and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.660
 always claimed are the same weight 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.470
 or a little more or a little less 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:03.290
 Well, in general, a knife in my opinion is very 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.660
 high quality assembled for those Chinese 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.640
 more so green 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.200
 pad yet we think the map 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.800
 This is Bekart 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:19.320
 ribbons as linen hairs rise 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.570
 well, is this a jett and do be map of everything 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:28.970
 already for the Chinese 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:28.970
 progress is such a handsome caretaker 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.390
 but the video did to share 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.620
 what is possible and the Chinese sometimes 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:44.010
 take and they are pretty good knives 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.860
 especially as i work at work 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.810
 he has to cut the little ring before 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.240
 all bullshit 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.810
 even the same mineral wool Domingo de seems to me 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.370
 Any knife can kill one cut this 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.640
 slabs of mineral wool and 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.250
 the edge is poured like that avatar is not 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.060
 but still called it 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:09.240
 lowered minerals kills hem by 1 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.880
 also plastic tapes want to share 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.400
 even upset some tree and everything 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.330
 equal to it interspersing there sand yet 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.940
 anything 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:23.670
 but also keeps well this is what we have 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:26.340
 chrome namely yanofsky I smell two times 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:30.840
 in a week, well, when much will achieve something 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:36.330
 more often it turns out that's all Iâ€™m doing 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:40.890
 wanted to say about this knife all done 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:44.060
 pretty play and what else tamura 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.060
 in addition
