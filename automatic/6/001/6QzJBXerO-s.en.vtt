I opened the box to see this a contact

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.859 
I opened the box to see this a contact
lens<00:01:33.119> case<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> contact<00:01:35.909> lenses<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> made<00:01:36.689> up

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
lens case the contact lenses is made up

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.620 
lens case the contact lenses is made up
of<00:01:37.020> thirty-eight<00:01:37.469> percent<00:01:37.649> water<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:39.090> 40

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of thirty-eight percent water it is 40

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
of thirty-eight percent water it is 40
millimeters<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.350> diameter<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:41.069> its<00:01:41.340> base

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
millimeters in diameter and its base

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.230 
millimeters in diameter and its base
curve<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> 8.6<00:01:42.950> comfort<00:01:43.950> wise<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.670> okay

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
curve is 8.6 comfort wise they are okay

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.020 
curve is 8.6 comfort wise they are okay
however<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.499> might<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.219> little<00:01:47.340> bit<00:01:47.579> biased

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
however I might be a little bit biased

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
however I might be a little bit biased
there<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.539> my<00:01:48.869> eyes<00:01:49.109> are<00:01:49.139> but<00:01:49.679> larger

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there because my eyes are but larger

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.749 
there because my eyes are but larger
than<00:01:50.249> the<00:01:50.340> average<00:01:50.759> person's<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> might

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
than the average person's so I might

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
than the average person's so I might
need<00:01:53.759> maybe<00:01:54.149> contact<00:01:55.020> lens<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> larger

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
need maybe contact lens which is larger

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
need maybe contact lens which is larger
in<00:01:56.429> diameter<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.569> this<00:01:57.780> might<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.049> more

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
in diameter so this might be more

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.999 
in diameter so this might be more
comfortable<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.979> someone<00:01:59.459> with<00:01:59.609> a<00:01:59.639> smaller

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
comfortable for someone with a smaller

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.749 
comfortable for someone with a smaller
its<00:02:02.009> lifespan<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.789> one<00:02:03.060> year<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.630> cool
