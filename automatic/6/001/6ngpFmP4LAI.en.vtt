 hello know that dr von today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.089
 unpacking video that precedes the video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 test of nokia lumia 800 30 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 so it's a mobile that has not appeared 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 recently he's already a few months old but 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 his music that you asked me to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.820
 many times in test so it is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.170
 time for me to do just that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.160
 with a little delay I catch up 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.189
 a little bit late right now 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 so the nokia lumia 800 30 a mobile that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.250
 in may 2015 when I'm doing this video 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.019
 is well we manage to find him at 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.160
 less than 300 euros on the web so that's it 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.289
 we manage to make good business 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 this famous nokia lumia 800 30 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.050
 so today we are on the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.279
 unpacking video we will linger on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.690
 the box in a quick first glimpse 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 about the contents of the box and the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.340
 phone also in a fast first 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.649
 preview 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 knowing that this phone had already been 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.550
 presented by raphael during 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 the launch press event 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 but just right here unpacking and then 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.010
 later test that will give you a little 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.930
 little more detail in any case my 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.129
 feeling your own feelings about this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 mobile while rafael you already have 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 given his then on the front side of 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.340
 the question box we find the back of the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.500
 mobile with particular focus on and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 of course the pure picture sensor with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 the photo sensor pure view certainly and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 the optics the ice on the left side of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.080
 the box we find the inscription nokia 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 lumia because yes this is one of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.409
 last nokia until 10 years but the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.330
 mobile light is called all microsoft 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.939
 light so it's called nokia lumia 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.439
 800 30 points are green for tackle at 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.159
 furniture in this box is fine 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 green color 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.650
 which is independent of the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.420
 front of the mobile you can very 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.799
 well have forgiveness of the front face of the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 box you can very well have this 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.470
 front box 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 but here a punch that can be of a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.960
 other color and therefore have a mobile 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 art and art of the box it be a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.560
 other color then on the right side of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.390
 the box we find the serial number 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 on the bottom of the box mobile by 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 dorian everything on the top not much 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 at the back of the box so we find 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 the inscription of course nokia lumia 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.479
 800 30 brands a few spades 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 rates that tell you what's out there 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 there is in the box we find the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.009
 four hospitals for the colors of the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 mobile so there is black it is 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.479
 available in black white green and orange 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.130
 we also find the fact that eh 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.420
 well it's good windows phone he 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 was going radio mix function hermabessiÃ¨re 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.950
 drive more what is logical pure view 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.140
 so that this photo sensor is the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.560
 techno the dolby photo sensor a good 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.719
 note 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 it is wireless charging dock it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.819
 wireless charging with a suitable base 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.899
 and he is well endowed with a tool hate 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.939
 it's fine but nokia on 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.540
 recalls here and we return from the visual of 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.799
 face in context of mobile this is not so 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.359
 we open the box that is not all 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.409
 new since this provident has already been 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.090
 tested but would have a 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.739
 news agency the press agency of 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.930
 nokia but here it has already been tested this 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.159
 mobile so we find the mobile in 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.180
 himself sent a little bit of 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.230
 cleaning that I do because the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.519
 previous testers apart summer 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.150
 particularly neat but six times 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.379
 cleaning 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.909
 he could have done something 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.290
 thing before we return it we find 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.269
 so the mobile itself that presents 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 well with this pretty nice chassis 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.560
 metal color it seems to me that it's 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 metal i will look at it on raphael in 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.260
 know more than me for the moment since 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.579
 made the presentation 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.650
 I still have a little novice on this 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.090
 mobile but yeah it's metal 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 it's good metal on it 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.180
 of concern with particular songs that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.219
 we see below what battery 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.599
 extractives does not cash battery that can 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.650
 to be removed by the ons and therefore battery 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.409
 necessarily that is a battery 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.620
 extractives go hop here the location 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.239
 of and well the micro sim simply 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.159
 here the location of the microsd 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.230
 the battery we will linger on 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.989
 since it is a battery so format 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.180
 kiss kids any model vl case to 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.650
 4 art I just tell you that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
 you would be interested in buying 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.590
 second battery in addition to one for 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 have more autonomy in case when when 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.620
 you are in your travels or and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.729
 well for example to buy a 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.500
 second battery when it will be 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:26.109
 tired within a year two years or more 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.540
 so it's a 2200 milan battery 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.189
 fear that will allow me precisely and well 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.709
 during the test give you my idea about 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.030
 autonomy is there because of course the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.470
 battery in German will be the subject of a 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.000
 test in any case more precisely 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.180
 the mobile's autonomy will be part of a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.099
 point during the test 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.909
 as usual at toys for fun like 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.549
 we do things well 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.319
 this is a little parenthesis so the 8 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.750
 present well on it no wonder 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.609
 it's a mobile nokia c1 mobile lumia 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.430
 well done metal frame 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.290
 that's so rigid to have advanced yeah that's 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.299
 well it's very solid it's good eric 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 the phone and position in version in 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.579
 carton and underneath diversion a carton 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.900
 since we then find the 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.039
 bulk accessories thanks to the testers 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.019
 previous one so we find hop 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.919
 let's go crazy too let's put 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.900
 brothel in the boxes 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.579
 so we find a pedestrian kit that is not 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.849
 no entry this is a good 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.139
 thing 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.069
 and anyway phone is not 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.090
 entry level either it is rather 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.409
 typical mid- range 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 finally mid-range early upscale 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.409
 so we find a pedestrian kit with 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.150
 In-ear headphones with a 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.360
 quite special shape this action he 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.460
 herman slightly bend bend so see 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.610
 we also find the button 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.110
 hang up with microphone input 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.479
 here we find the beautiful length 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.729
 cable up and we find a 3.5 jack 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.139
 the classic piece which is 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.889
 anyway the phone is a good 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.180
 deacon points 5 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.320
 we find what I appreciate 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.669
 especially on the phones 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.560
 nokia including which are means 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.500
 watch video to know a real cable 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.449
 usb micro usb and small originality sa 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.370
 first to jo it in a mobile in 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.530
 a box of mobiles there was a 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.330
 cache a cache for the usb port 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.940
 ok this is the first time I see 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.979
 it's not sure it's very very useful 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.090
 finally a lot is a good choice it is 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.550
 like that an originality 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.020
 back also the AC adapter up 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.169
 then the AC adapter with the input 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.220
 fall or jack the port forgiveness usb all 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.630
 simply that makes it possible to connect the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.870
 cable that you had a few moments 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.370
 tagging nokia sees there and we find a 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.009
 little documentation including the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.060
 does that make it charles bing so 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.380
 it is well wireless charging 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.990
 you have a small 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.669
 information about nokia products that 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.080
 are wireless charging products you
