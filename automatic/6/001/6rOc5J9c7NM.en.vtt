00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.080
 a day after the 0 3 victory trainer a select group led by 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.180
 assistant trainer hennie spijkerman outside but can be seen under all church 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.180
 win and march stekelenburg 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.119
 had to stop few balls today more than he otherwise demonstrated 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 his sublime technique 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.069
 moments later, there was practiced finishing and there were some beautiful ones 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.069
 goals like monier android 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.859
 and of the man who normally stops the balls and Stekelenburg 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.620
 and while Stekelenburg and choirs scored well, the base trained 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 for example, one of yesterday's goal scorers was miralem sulejmani 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.910
 sulejmani will be able to create and upload ajax third party 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 gulbis made the nadal not as beautiful as tenth 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.910
 the final phase of the cup match 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 He is still a hit but why not 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.870
 20 points for the Dutch market competition was and 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 he never has from spain 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.490
 no respect yet 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.579
 he trained wouter is a nice result for us and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.160
 I am that we play 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 for the plan we have too 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 more and more chance 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.860
 well but i try and count 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 the ifaw side it is just and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 a good sign 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 year also scored the 0 3 again it was a nice ending 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.049
 no me 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.900
 the score again and 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.230
 good for most and for my trust 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.230
 I can also try the rain there per game 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 the first round of oman 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.130
 but also for the team 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 sulejmani 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.860
 a score 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.990
 it's important to me and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.359
 7 we are going to try 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.129
 chimney several times west 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.049
 so Friday again 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.949
 9 and do my best 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.059
 the first three points and 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.509
 it is good livni 4 frightening for 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.120
 within the ajax and if it can score it 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.790
 hopefully again against the county on Friday evening and if it included him 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.820
 many games fail, there is always an alternative
