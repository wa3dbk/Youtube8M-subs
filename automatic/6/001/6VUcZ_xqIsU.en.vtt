hello this is Chihiro aka Choicerish.

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:14.966
today, i would like to introduce this Peel -off gommage by SHIKISAI.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.678
it's kind of hard to tell you everything 
 only from my thoughts after using it.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.607
so i will use this app called HADAMORE which is a skin check app.

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:36.077
by taking pix using a skin check lens, the app will quantify the 
 level of your skin clarity, blemishes, brightening, pores, wrinkles and texture.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:43.070
so ill use this app and review this peel off gommage product!

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:50.884
this item is called gommage so it will exfoliate your skin.

00:00:51.862 --> 00:01:00.758
it doesnt dry out your skin and just get rid of the dead skin.

00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:05.253
so here are some benefits of using this item.

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:09.184
it brightens up your skin.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.962
it helps lotions or serums you use penetrate into skins better.

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.689
makes your skin feel smooth.

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:21.457
and it helps makeup stay on better.

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:28.193
its made of rice so it suits japanese skin.

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:41.380
gommage products sometimes irritate your skin but this one is not harsh on 
 your skin so you can use it once or twice a week.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.620
you can use this on dry face so im going to use it now.

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:54.240
after you cleanse your face, dry it well. and 
 now take some of the gommage item.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:02:00.550
for 1 application, you can take 2 to 
 3 pumps so i take 2 today.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:07.650
put it on your forehead, chin, cheeks and 
 on your nose and massage it gently.

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:15.500
massage this gel-like lotion in a circular motion from inside gently.

00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:20.910
soon you can feel the lotion becomes beads.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.570
on the nose, massage from top to bottom.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:33.050
i dont like the black heads on my nose so i massage it more.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:38.450
on the chin, from the middle, massage it in a small circular motion outwards.

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:46.340
after massage throughly and the lotion becomes like this, rinse 
 it all off with cold or lukewarm water.

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:51.770
after that, just take your regular skin care steps.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.270
now i finished my skincare steps so ill use this Hadamore app.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:07.490
its great! i can see even a small hair.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:23.200
makes me feel like shaving my face. now i have this pic and i 
 took a pic when i wasnt using this product. so let's compare.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.150
the texture level got 73 from 64 and blemishes level got 
 95 from 75! i wonder blemishes get better that quickly...?

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:40.770
my skin is normal as before. wrinkle level is 
 75 from 63. pores got 67 from 52.

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:48.640
skin clarity is 84 from 82. the brightening 
 is 72 from 73. it went down..

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:52.220
but other than that, it all went up.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.260
thats a good result on Hadamore.

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:59.420
especially on blemishes, it went up a lot.

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:05.800
maybe coz i didnt take a pic on the exact same spot.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:20.170
i have a sensitive skin so i tend to get 
 irritations on my skin after using gommage products.

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:35.370
but this one is so gentle and when i used all 
 of my regular skincare steps, they sank in much better!

00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:40.550
i used more of skincare than usual.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.660
well i used only this once so ill keep using this from now.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:48.920

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:55.620
