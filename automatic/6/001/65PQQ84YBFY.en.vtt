00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
this article Spencer stated this halo
wars<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.630> something<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.140> interested<00:00:25.740> in

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
wars is something I'm very interested in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
wars is something I'm very interested in
I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.939> halo<00:00:27.150> wars<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> high<00:00:27.990> quality

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I think halo wars was a high quality

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.490 
I think halo wars was a high quality
console<00:00:28.949> based<00:00:29.160> RTS<00:00:29.640> game<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.960> fun<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
console based RTS game it was fun and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
console based RTS game it was fun and
especially<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.969> some

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
especially now when I think about some

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
especially now when I think about some
of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> capability<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:34.920> some

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of the capability I think about some

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
of the capability I think about some
voice<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> other<00:00:35.969> things<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> could

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
voice and other things that you could

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
voice and other things that you could
add<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> gameplay

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
add to that that's the kind of gameplay

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220 
add to that that's the kind of gameplay
that<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.600> great<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> those

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that I think would be great in those

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
that I think would be great in those
scenarios<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.579> game<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.000> maybe<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> can

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
scenarios and also game that maybe I can

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.110 
scenarios and also game that maybe I can
play<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.899> multiple<00:00:43.410> devices<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> suspect

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
play on multiple devices so I suspect

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
play on multiple devices so I suspect
you'll<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.570> us<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.960> something<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.530> dot<00:00:47.039> dot

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you'll see us do something with dot dot

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
you'll see us do something with dot dot
dot<00:00:47.489> they're<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> busy<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.870> at

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
dot they're kind of busy right now at

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
dot they're kind of busy right now at
three<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.620> three<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> good<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.670> we're

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
three for three which is good and we're

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
three for three which is good and we're
really<00:00:51.360> happy<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.320> working

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really happy with what they're working

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
really happy with what they're working
on<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.120> opportunity

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
on but I think there is an opportunity

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
on but I think there is an opportunity
for<00:00:54.840> us<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.350> something<00:00:55.770> more<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
for us to do something more with that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
for us to do something more with that
franchise<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.629> Spencer<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.230> definitely

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
franchise so Spencer is definitely

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
franchise so Spencer is definitely
hinting<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> halo<00:00:59.460> wars<00:00:59.699> too<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.510> also

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hinting at a halo wars too but also

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
hinting at a halo wars too but also
reassures<00:01:01.469> us<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.039> most<00:01:02.309> likely<00:01:02.550> come

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
reassures us that will most likely come

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
reassures us that will most likely come
after<00:01:03.420> halo<00:01:03.750> 5<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:04.979> opinion<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
after halo 5 which in my opinion is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
after halo 5 which in my opinion is
awesome<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.210> helo<00:01:06.720> five<00:01:06.960> should<00:01:07.200> be

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
awesome because helo five should be

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
awesome because helo five should be
their<00:01:07.439> main<00:01:07.590> focus<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> halo

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
their main focus as of now but a halo

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
their main focus as of now but a halo
wars<00:01:09.659> 2<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.380> awesome<00:01:10.799> afterwards<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
wars 2 would be awesome afterwards and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
wars 2 would be awesome afterwards and
more<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.180> likely<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.780> made<00:01:12.990> by<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> different

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
more than likely be made by a different
