00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.949

 in front of the wheel you can canet and there he 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.770
 tell you what serves detection sub 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 inflation and where is the kit of 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.020
 temporary troubleshooting 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 okay you can also here is the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.880
 list of tools you can you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 even have access to videos that you 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 explain what to do in order to be able to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 clearly inflated here I am looking for a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.369
 square 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 you press the button on the button 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.080
 to gmail in niche and I have never 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.549
 tasted I want a search 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.409
 look here that he spotted the ass so 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.819
 I step back and I will follow the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.130
 on-screen indications are affected at 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.319
 flying that will handle 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 I'm not touching anything 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:03.380
 park I just manage to slow you down 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.380
 still 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.420
 I'm going back to the front 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.420
 I do not touch top screen tunis 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.730
 digard and this is the beginning of the voice yesterday 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.500
 autonomy gives you the wheels well 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.670
 right as it should be you can me the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.930
 redo for China from the outside 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.340
 now for that I had to plan 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.819
 the radar detects paf anyway 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 speed up and brake my flying wings 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:41.739
 who turns all this is something that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.879
 exists since I have not bad it's a little 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.129
 of bazaar to put all this on the road 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 still what it takes but finally me 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.230
 I find the only thing is that we 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.650
 understands that you see even the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.079
 leadership students this is the beginning of the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.659
 autonomous car it was a pair or there 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.090
 we will test the applications acer a 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.659
 little educational path this morning so 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.430
 we can take an optional system 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.959
 connects to peugeot connect apps that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.599
 let's download I already had it 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.060
 says on the sedan but some apps 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:15.340
 for the car world in the car 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.900
 here there is a key 3g which is so a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.970
 once we started the system that's 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.919
 was going the apps that are on 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.359
 the touch screen and the ch 340 euros I 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.840
 believe something like that here is enough 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.569
 that's enough 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.010
 it's a little less than 400 euros the most 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.900
 known is that I have more experienced its 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.430
 colleagues because good bah coyotes already 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.470
 it's worth in the two hundred euros 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.049
 close so there we have a coyote board 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.299
 fuels knows where are the stations 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.099
 service at what price around my home 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.900
 where are there parking spaces 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.750
 of could the car parks that are 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.349
 connected via michelin with the traffic the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.449
 Yellow Pages 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.569
 and then there are things that are a 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:52.180
 little more under the tourist angle 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.430
 there all the Michelin content so engraved 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.299
 red guide and guide them to that too 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.010
 that's what you want to show us 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.079
 morning I arrive at the touquet I know 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.090
 nothing there what can I do so 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.500
 and i have tripadvisor so we're gonna go 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.430
 play a little bit with both so 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.680
 everything is included in the package i hope 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 that in the 400 euros package actually we 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.159
 for all of europe 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.130
 red guide green guide tripadvisor 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.040
 coyotes and other applications 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.830
 zero and after that and after we have a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.960
 annual holiday subscription which is at 149 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.730
 euros which allows to have the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.430
 updates and then coyotes what 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.270
 especially so for example if we take the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.150
 trip advisor 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.980
 that's how it comes around 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.200
 vehicle for example we will watch 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.310
 what we have here so I pressed 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.230
 on a button and depending on the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 gps locality he already knows where I am 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.470
 since it is affirmed by the gps 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.420
 what to do around 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.520
 very large vehicle he will offer me 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.240
 things with the logic of 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.880
 tripadvisor ie things with 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.800
 rankings so that's the attraction 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.370
 number one is the military cemetery 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.530
 of étaples marys is the museum of 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.100
 fishermen and the sea ​​that gets the touquet 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.240
 Paris beach 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.100
 do it for example I hit the golf course 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.960
 guide to the address the phone etc 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.790
 I can call I can guide to and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.410
 five green guides actually they send 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.430
 gps information 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.430
 I have more to do 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.070
 day shot there they will tell the mode he has 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.210
 farted the lead so it's great 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.070
 so what's that then in it's 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.080
 a pac jaf and kieren walshe not that's 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.760
 bread just because you 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.980
 okay it's just the bread it's not 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.910
 the flamiche I do it for daniela he 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.910
 wanted me to make petitrenaud 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.640
 but it's alexander who tells us that 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.720
 it's the best it's the best 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.070
 flamiche but here I would like to see the 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.180
 flamiche there it's just people 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.980
 so that's still cool 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.480
 at home you make bread on fire 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:29.750
 wood 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:33.170
 not bad I do not know if I 'll put that to you 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.400
 please daniel mehats to your mother on 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.940
 can have three grandmother cafes too 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.940
 at the same time
