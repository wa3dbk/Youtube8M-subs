all right progress on the frame I have
the<00:00:08.340> shock<00:00:09.340> mounts<00:00:11.280> put<00:00:12.280> up<00:00:12.460> I<00:00:12.730> took<00:00:13.510> this

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
the shock mounts put up I took this

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.080 
the shock mounts put up I took this
rectangular<00:00:14.620> tubing<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.340> same<00:00:15.549> thing<00:00:15.790> I<00:00:15.880> used

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
rectangular tubing the same thing I used

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.390 
rectangular tubing the same thing I used
on<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.360> motor<00:00:16.540> mounts<00:00:16.930> it's<00:00:17.680> not<00:00:17.890> tubing<00:00:18.250> it's

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
on the motor mounts it's not tubing it's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.670 
on the motor mounts it's not tubing it's
pipe<00:00:18.640> it's<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.330> real<00:00:19.539> heavy<00:00:19.869> wall<00:00:20.140> thick<00:00:20.440> stuff

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
pipe it's a real heavy wall thick stuff

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.080 
pipe it's a real heavy wall thick stuff
and<00:00:21.539> cut<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.570> V<00:00:22.869> in<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.320> just<00:00:24.279> kind<00:00:24.520> of<00:00:24.580> V<00:00:24.730> in<00:00:24.939> it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
and cut a V in it just kind of V in it

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.840 
and cut a V in it just kind of V in it
and<00:00:25.269> bent<00:00:25.600> this<00:00:25.810> down<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.560> then<00:00:27.220> set<00:00:27.519> it<00:00:27.670> so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
and bent this down and then set it so

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.610 
and bent this down and then set it so
it's<00:00:27.970> level<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:33.090> welded<00:00:34.090> on<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.330> two<00:00:34.510> tabs<00:00:34.840> to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
it's level and welded on the two tabs to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.520 
it's level and welded on the two tabs to
hold<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.040> shock<00:00:36.550> tower<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.960> there<00:00:38.020> and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
hold the shock tower right there and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.360 
hold the shock tower right there and
then<00:00:38.829> ran<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.190> up<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:40.270> right<00:00:40.780> here<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.440> then<00:00:42.219> I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
then ran it up to right here and then I

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
then ran it up to right here and then I
took<00:00:42.430> two<00:00:42.850> pieces<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.300> pipe<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.219> one-inch

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
took two pieces of pipe this is one-inch

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.630 
took two pieces of pipe this is one-inch
pipe<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:47.969> bent<00:00:48.969> them<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:50.410> sucked<00:00:51.070> them<00:00:51.250> way

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
pipe and bent them just sucked them way

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.700 
pipe and bent them just sucked them way
back<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.090> there<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.600> welded<00:00:53.079> them<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.320> inside

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
back in there and welded them up inside

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.100 
back in there and welded them up inside
and<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:55.149> come<00:00:55.390> down<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:57.160> into<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.579> frame

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
and they come down and go into the frame

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.729 
and they come down and go into the frame
like<00:00:59.110> so<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.480> you'll<00:01:02.230> notice<00:01:02.410> there's<00:01:02.680> a

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
like so and you'll notice there's a

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.999 
like so and you'll notice there's a
cross<00:01:03.010> base<00:01:03.309> right<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.239> line<00:01:04.449> with<00:01:04.479> this

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
cross base right in line with this

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.700 
cross base right in line with this
that's<00:01:06.009> pretty<00:01:06.220> strong<00:01:06.580> there<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.560> one

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
that's pretty strong there and that one

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's pretty strong there and that one
goes<00:01:08.890> right<00:01:08.979> up<00:01:09.189> into<00:01:09.369> that<00:01:09.490> two

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.789 

I<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.890> have<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:46.659> some<00:01:46.900> bottom<00:01:47.320> welding

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
I will have to do some bottom welding

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.670 
I will have to do some bottom welding
once<00:01:48.040> we<00:01:48.190> get<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.549> engine<00:01:49.300> off<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.680> further

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
once we get the engine off and further

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.530 
once we get the engine off and further
down<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.100> road<00:01:51.220> we<00:01:51.610> turn<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.000> whole<00:01:52.150> front

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
down the road we turn the whole front

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.620 
down the road we turn the whole front
frame<00:01:52.869> over<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.790> weld<00:01:54.790> all<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:54.970> underside

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
frame over and weld all the underside

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
frame over and weld all the underside
stuff<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:57.220> we<00:01:58.210> got<00:01:58.360> one<00:01:58.509> more<00:01:58.659> thing<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:59.080> do

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
stuff and we got one more thing to do

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.570 
stuff and we got one more thing to do
the<00:02:00.300> dog<00:02:01.300> bone<00:02:01.600> was<00:02:02.530> connected<00:02:03.100> right<00:02:03.280> there

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the dog bone was connected right there

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.580 
the dog bone was connected right there
which<00:02:04.300> stopped<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.050> engine<00:02:05.380> from

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
which stopped the the engine from

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.090 
which stopped the the engine from
flopping<00:02:05.920> back<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.340> forth<00:02:06.550> except<00:02:07.540> that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
flopping back and forth except that

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.760 
flopping back and forth except that
we're<00:02:09.100> going<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.489> solid<00:02:09.819> mount<00:02:10.179> since

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
we're going to do a solid mount since

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.050 
we're going to do a solid mount since
everything<00:02:11.770> else<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.130> solid<00:02:12.520> mount<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.910> whole

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
everything else is solid mount the whole

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.330 
everything else is solid mount the whole
motor<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.510> solid<00:02:13.870> mounted<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.070> we're<00:02:15.280> gonna

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
motor is solid mounted in so we're gonna

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.240 
motor is solid mounted in so we're gonna
make<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.780> custom-built<00:02:16.780> solar<00:02:17.650> mount<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
make a custom-built solar mount the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.729 
make a custom-built solar mount the
grunts<00:02:18.580> from<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.260> down<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> frame

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
grunts from here down to the frame

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.430 
grunts from here down to the frame
somewhere<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.690> that's<00:02:23.170> just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
somewhere right in there and that's just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.630 
somewhere right in there and that's just
hold<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.800> steady<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:25.269> there<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.570> four<00:02:26.640> four

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
hold it steady and so there be four four

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.490 
hold it steady and so there be four four
mounts<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.510> engine<00:02:28.930> mounts<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.620> setup

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
mounts for engine mounts for this setup

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.910 
mounts for engine mounts for this setup
so<00:02:32.500> that's<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.290> tonight

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
so that's that's it tonight

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.050 
so that's that's it tonight
Sunday<00:02:36.610> night<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:38.459> time<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:39.730> get<00:02:39.880> cleaned

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
Sunday night and time to go get cleaned

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.190 
Sunday night and time to go get cleaned
up<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.600> crash

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680 

I<00:02:44.290> think<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.040> looks<00:02:45.190> pretty<00:02:45.310> good<00:02:45.510> hope<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
I think it looks pretty good hope it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.900 
I think it looks pretty good hope it
works
