burning more and more you're gonna go
probably<00:03:12.470> faster<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.100> faster<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.850> get

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
probably faster and faster really get

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.850 
probably faster and faster really get
into<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.390> getting<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.050> groove<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.530> crush

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
into it getting to the groove and crush

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.820 
into it getting to the groove and crush
it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.740 

now<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.890> last<00:03:23.220> exercise<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.270> called<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
now the last exercise is called a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
now the last exercise is called a
bicycle<00:03:25.380> crunch<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.980> again<00:03:26.340> you're<00:03:26.550> doing<00:03:26.670> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
bicycle crunch and again you're doing a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.020 
bicycle crunch and again you're doing a
1-1<00:03:27.569> count<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.800> need<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> be<00:03:29.130> doing<00:03:29.430> 50

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
1-1 count here and need to be doing 50

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.020 
1-1 count here and need to be doing 50
repetitions<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:31.260> what<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.010> means<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.580> one

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
repetitions and what that means is one

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.330 
repetitions and what that means is one
rep<00:03:33.390> only<00:03:33.810> counts<00:03:34.260> after<00:03:34.620> you've<00:03:34.770> gone<00:03:34.950> back

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
rep only counts after you've gone back

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.790 
rep only counts after you've gone back
and<00:03:35.610> forth<00:03:35.849> once<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.560> exercise

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
and forth once so for this exercise

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.320 
and forth once so for this exercise
you're<00:03:38.370> gonna<00:03:38.489> need<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.640> bit<00:03:38.849> of<00:03:38.880> coordination

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
you're gonna need a bit of coordination

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.089 
you're gonna need a bit of coordination
obviously<00:03:40.319> so<00:03:40.440> if<00:03:40.500> you've<00:03:40.590> never<00:03:40.680> done<00:03:40.920> this

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
obviously so if you've never done this

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.850 
obviously so if you've never done this
before<00:03:41.360> start<00:03:42.360> off<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.569> little<00:03:42.690> slow<00:03:42.930> try<00:03:43.800> it

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
before start off a little slow try it
