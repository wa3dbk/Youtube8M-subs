00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.880 

well<00:00:00.510> under<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.750> same<00:00:00.930> on<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.140> other<00:00:01.199> side<00:00:01.530> so

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
well under the same on the other side so

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.849 
well under the same on the other side so
at<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.580> point<00:00:02.850> leads<00:00:03.750> we've<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> point

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
at this point leads we've got a point

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.240 
at this point leads we've got a point
here<00:00:05.069> so<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.339> points<00:00:05.490> gonna<00:00:05.879> start<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:07.250> and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
here so the points gonna start here and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.419 
here so the points gonna start here and
we<00:00:08.370> could<00:00:08.519> draw<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.210> could<00:00:09.450> what<00:00:10.429> but

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
we could draw it and you could what but

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.749 
we could draw it and you could what but
I<00:00:11.519> would<00:00:11.670> suggest<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.559> actually<00:00:13.759> drawing

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
I would suggest is actually drawing

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.790 
I would suggest is actually drawing
another<00:00:15.059> plane<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.139> well<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> should<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
another plane and well I should do that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.730 
another plane and well I should do that
good<00:00:17.390> will<00:00:18.390> draw<00:00:18.539> another<00:00:18.720> plane<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.619> we've

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
good will draw another plane so we've

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.349 
good will draw another plane so we've
got<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.310> back<00:00:20.550> plane<00:00:20.789> we've<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> side

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
got this back plane we've got the side

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.759 
got this back plane we've got the side
plane<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.869> draw<00:00:22.050> another<00:00:22.320> plane

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
plane I'm going to draw another plane

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
plane I'm going to draw another plane
here<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:25.609> that's<00:00:26.609> basically<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.630> you're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
here so that's basically what you're

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.070 
here so that's basically what you're
what<00:00:28.529> were<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.460> doing<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
what were you know what we're doing is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.000 
what were you know what we're doing is
actually<00:00:31.080> creating<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.739> they<00:00:34.890> would

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
actually creating this is how they would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
actually creating this is how they would
make<00:00:35.430> models<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
make models in the you know in the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
make models in the you know in the
computer<00:00:37.200> three<00:00:37.350> dimensionally<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.430> would

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
computer three dimensionally they would

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
computer three dimensionally they would
take<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.059> three<00:00:39.719> part<00:00:39.899> drawing<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> were

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
take a three part drawing like you were

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
take a three part drawing like you were
doing<00:00:40.739> drafting<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.969> would<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.629> don't

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
doing drafting you would have you don't

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
doing drafting you would have you don't
have<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.899> top<00:00:43.350> view<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.800> front<00:00:44.430> view<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:45.090> view

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
have a top view a front view a side view

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
have a top view a front view a side view
and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.620> reviews<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> could

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and then with those reviews you could

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
and then with those reviews you could
actually<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:49.170> three-dimensional

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
actually just on a three-dimensional

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually just on a three-dimensional
scale<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.230> draw<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.500> them

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
scale like you just draw and put them

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
scale like you just draw and put them
all<00:00:52.710> together<00:00:52.860> nice<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> slowly<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
all together nice and slowly and this is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.990 
all together nice and slowly and this is
exactly<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
exactly how that we do it in the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.210 
exactly how that we do it in the
computer<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> old-school<00:01:01.850> so

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
computer this is this is old-school so

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.350 
computer this is this is old-school so
like<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.309> said<00:01:05.369> last<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.030> you're<00:01:06.180> getting

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
like I said last time if you're getting

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.859 
like I said last time if you're getting
confused<00:01:07.610> wait<00:01:08.610> till<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.049> execute<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
confused wait till I execute it and then

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.910 
confused wait till I execute it and then
and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:12.960> pause<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and then pause it and then do it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.840 
and then pause it and then do it
yourself<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> you're<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.580> getting<00:01:17.759> lost<00:01:19.850> all

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
yourself so you're not getting lost all

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.289 
yourself so you're not getting lost all
right<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> middle<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.700> guy<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
right we have a middle of this guy this

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
right we have a middle of this guy this
is<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.689> looking<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:26.130> just

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
is what we're looking for it I'm just

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
is what we're looking for it I'm just
kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> drawing<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> extra<00:01:27.360> lines

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
kind of drawing it all the extra lines

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
kind of drawing it all the extra lines
just<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.180> exactly<00:01:30.600> what

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
just so we so you we know exactly what

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
just so we so you we know exactly what
we're<00:01:31.140> looking<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:34.070> okay<00:01:35.070> no<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.360> at

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we're looking at here okay no so this at

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
we're looking at here okay no so this at
the<00:01:36.630> top<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.049> guy<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.070> he's<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.460> run

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the top of this guy so he's gonna run

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:51.300 
the top of this guy so he's gonna run
parallel<00:01:43.579> on<00:01:44.579> top<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.000> guy<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.240> well

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.070 

I'm<00:01:51.790> gonna<00:01:51.940> slow<00:01:52.120> down<00:01:52.150> here<00:01:52.450> from<00:01:52.540> image<00:01:52.780> so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
I'm gonna slow down here from image so

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.950 
I'm gonna slow down here from image so
people<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.650> kinda<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:55.450> what<00:01:55.570> I'm<00:01:55.660> doing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
people can kinda see what I'm doing

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.080 
people can kinda see what I'm doing
doesn't<00:01:56.920> help<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.340> got<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.200> the<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
doesn't help that I got the the the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.710 
doesn't help that I got the the the
drawing<00:02:01.420> skewed<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.700> he's<00:02:03.880> laying<00:02:04.240> like<00:02:04.390> whoa

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
drawing skewed so he's laying like whoa

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.630 
drawing skewed so he's laying like whoa
Kelly's<00:02:05.350> lines<00:02:05.620> what<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.070> heck<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.460> we<00:02:06.520> do

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
Kelly's lines what the heck can we do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.820 
Kelly's lines what the heck can we do
with<00:02:06.760> all<00:02:06.880> those<00:02:06.970> lines<00:02:07.210> but<00:02:08.170> essentially

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
with all those lines but essentially

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.100 
with all those lines but essentially
what<00:02:09.160> we've<00:02:09.280> got<00:02:09.490> here<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:10.030> if<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:10.990> it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
what we've got here is if you can see it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.360 
what we've got here is if you can see it
and<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.320> start<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.680> train<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.040> eye<00:02:12.070> but

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and you start to train your eye but

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.180 
and you start to train your eye but
we've<00:02:12.520> got<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.480> box<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.950> middle

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
we've got the box here for the middle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.420 
we've got the box here for the middle
plane<00:02:15.400> we've<00:02:15.880> got<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.330> box<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
plane we've got the back box here and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.350 
plane we've got the back box here and
then<00:02:18.580> we've<00:02:18.670> got<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.180> new<00:02:19.260> box<00:02:20.260> which<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.830> um

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
then we've got the new box which is um

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
then we've got the new box which is um
between<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.020> it's<00:02:23.140> basically<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.980> middle

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
between so it's basically this middle

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.740 
between so it's basically this middle
plane<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.480> running

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
plane but now it's this it's running

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050 
plane but now it's this it's running
this<00:02:25.840> way
