00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.769
 I bring you the revised unboxing of this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.660
 dock that has sent us the company ex 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.200
 You can find it on the page of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.990
 ex loves dotcom and well this is a dock 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.699
 in a little bit different if you're old 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.920
 subscriber of the channel you will remember that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 this company had sent us a former mistress 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.109
 when it was in beta version it comes out 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.870
 when it was not finished yet and now 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.670
 they have improved their material looks a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
 more beautiful material a more material 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 elegant at least this color that we 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 they have sent looks very nice indeed 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 very very nice on the bottom is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 a kind of like I do not know how to call it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 of plastic but this non-stick 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 so that it does not slip it looks very nice 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.549
 and well let's take this off once and for all 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.320
 so that we do not have any problems 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.960
 this is part of the micro suction that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.559
 handles in them for the devices the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.939
 iphone 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 let's turn it a little bit towards 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:07.820
 up to see that so we can 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 put here 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.430
 is this is very good because because we 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.920
 allows you to have the security of having a 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.330
 iphone or a very large phone you are going to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.590
 be sure that it will be 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.410
 completely stuck 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.500
 let's see the instructions you can see 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.480
 they manage a kind of insurance and the lobby 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 where is the car to crash what 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.530
 you can tilt so you do not have 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.380
 no problem here tell you how 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.020
 you can put you recommend not to put it 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.420
 down because you can drop the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 cellular but they wanted to put him in the middle or 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.130
 up on the back that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.140
 we found to take it off there is no need 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.120
 pull them and you do not have to turn and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.230
 here we have part of the micro suction 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.420
 they drive us out ok we go super 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340
 quick to play with this here is the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 sure I told them or what they tell us in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.170
 the instructions are supposed to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.410
 put it here let's turn a little bit 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.930
 completely right and tell us here 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.350
 super hard and here it is 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.140
 and now 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.530
 You can not move unless it's done 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 enough strength you can not do it if you 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 I put more strength I think it's going to break 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.820
 well in a very soft way without 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.920
 no problem can be moved 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.040
 simply putting the security we are going to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.820
 connect it and let's put it one more time 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 it gets pretty strong it's very stiff 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.610
 connect it to this is very very rigid and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 Well what I like is that you can 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.310
 turn it without any problem as more you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.490
 Like it or how else you want this is something 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.040
 quite useful and quite practical in 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.660
 truth is something very good too 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.900
 quite a father is that he is completely 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.900
 rotating already quite angles that is not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.030
 you can only turn it in 365 degrees 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.790
 but you can turn it to several 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.210
 angles from top to bottom so that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.370
 you can see I do not know any series so 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.930
 you can be more comfortable for example 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.069
 we are going to peel again what 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.870
 takeoff 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.269
 and we put it exactly half 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.299
 we remove the insurance I want it to have 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.400
 about this time we are going back to 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.560
 put the insurance just look now 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.109
 he does not want the security is being locked 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.600
 that at that moment does not let me put the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:32.570
 sure I think you can see this one 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.130
 I do not know up to the top I did not have any 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.070
 problem to put it but I can not 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.770
 go down but let's say here it's hard for me to work 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.110
 put it 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.420
 it is not well designed you have to be 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.130
 sincere many tell me I love your 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.400
 videos but why do you speak badly of the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.130
 accessories because why are you going to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.680
 buy an accessory that serves us ok 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.990
 here in 365 degrees 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.320
 works perfectly let's say in a 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.660
 horizontal form but at the moment of 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.600
 put it in the skate do not work 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.350
 at the time of putting it here we do not 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.350
 works 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.300
 it does not let me put it in vertical forgiveness in 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.880
 horizontal does not let me put it if not 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.350
 you can no matter how much you move for more 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.270
 that is here fighting does not leave me 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.750
 put it in this position in the Skype 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.950
 he does not leave me but see if he turned it 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.340
 the iphone here I can put the insurance without 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.740
 no problem something bad for my point 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.430
 of sight because because I can only 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.610
 have towards the iphone and so I'm going 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.760
 you just saw I would like to download it but 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.750
 is going to break if I force it I would like 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.420
 download it here 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.640
 is that it is badly unfortunately if 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.420
 you want to put your phone like this you are not going to 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.380
 to be able to decide and it was not, but it is 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.300
 not like that, it does not work only so you go 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.360
 to be able to have your iphone with a security 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.770
 and so that it does not move 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.560
 unfortunately I have to be honest not 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.450
 I liked it because you did not like me 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.690
 can say many for the simple fact 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.730
 that forces you to have a single angle 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.980
 having for example such a telephone 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.370
 big as is the iPhone 6 plus or if 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.410
 you have a galaxy, you will not be able to 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.960
 work or you will not be able to have it from a 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.670
 right way I for example right now 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.230
 in the position that I am here you 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.230
 they see well because the camera is towards 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.800
 above but I would like to have it not 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.170
 I know to a more inclined version a 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.210
 I do not know how to have a 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.610
 desk and now I would be having so 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.950
 I'm seeing myself or facing me 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.440
 I can not put the insurance if I loose it 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.650
 here it goes down and I have the risk that it 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.950
 I do not like the truth, let's remove it 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.670
 let's see how he tells us in the instructive 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:03.240
 we grab from here back we turn and ready 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.500
 it comes out without any problem 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.349
 but unfortunately if you ask me 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.229
 how much do I give in one's rating to 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.389
 day I will give you a six aesthetically is 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.449
 very nice at least this color that 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.310
 it's a gray like chrome it looks 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.889
 unbelievably father looks very nice 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.430
 They have greatly improved the pieces no longer 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.880
 they are plastic like before that is a 10 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.069
 but I repeat the positions in 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.099
 which is supposed to be the 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.229
 phone for example this position that 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.650
 they handle here in the picture I do not 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.750
 allows because the insurance expires in no 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.370
 let me put the insurance I only have 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.960
 have the phone in a way 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.970
 upwards inclined or very low 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.610
 This does not help me at all, having a 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.889
 phone so great good those are my 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.630
 impressions friends an apology to whom 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.000
 have offended with this video because 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.250
 then there are people who do not like that 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.780
 speak ill of the accessories but in this 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.870
 occasion I repeat again I would give it 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.699
 6 simply because it does not help me 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.390
 That is nice but if I can not 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.310
 occupy 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.410
