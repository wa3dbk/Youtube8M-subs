00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.989
 of course, coconut nut almost with 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.709
 stevia salt at the extract and 

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:40.509
 We need cocoa powder 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.390
 coconut butter then you just take it 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.530
 grated coconut 100 grams of it 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 that behind her with coconut loose butter 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 abhaben 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.800
 if it is of consistency with her yet 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.320
 you can not be perfect either 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:10.530
 optional a shot peanut or 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:13.069
 coconut then we need one 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 as brown as possible took her brown 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.110
 smug ones then we need one 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.760
 quarter teaspoon cinnamon half 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.840
 teaspoon of stevia two tablespoons 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.640
 cocoa powder a quarter teaspoon 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.100
 vanilla extract and finally 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.290
 a fingertip since this whole 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.840
 ingredients do you in a big bowl 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.670
 and farce all the ingredients together 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.930
 so that a correct consistency arises 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 after that you need a tuba or a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.709
 langform where you get the whole mass right 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.930
 pure pushes and flat uses at the end 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:01.019
 do you then your form for 15 to 20 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.239
 minutes either in the ice compartment or for 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.239
 two to three hours in the refrigerator 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.610
 so can the finished portraits 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.470
 if you leave the friesack after 23 hours 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.690
 and as you can see here is not me 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.190
 fake or so are tough too 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.230
 have a good consistency and taste 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.790
 also wonderful and that is not 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.650
 again so many questions pop up and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.940
 how much of it can eat so on then 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.220
 you should not belly of course 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.370
 yes, everything does not hit the point 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.099
 from biscuits at that time so enjoy two to 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.299
 three together are okay or something 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.660

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.660
