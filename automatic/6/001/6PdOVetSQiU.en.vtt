00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.859 

and<00:04:35.819> see<00:04:35.969> how<00:04:36.089> I'm<00:04:36.179> taking<00:04:36.479> them<00:04:36.539> out<00:04:36.719> and

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
and see how I'm taking them out and

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:38.629 
and see how I'm taking them out and
still<00:04:37.139> kind<00:04:37.439> of<00:04:37.499> holding<00:04:37.769> each<00:04:37.889> side<00:04:38.189> so<00:04:38.609> to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
still kind of holding each side so to

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.429 
still kind of holding each side so to
cut<00:04:39.149> down<00:04:39.299> on<00:04:39.359> any<00:04:39.659> type<00:04:39.839> of<00:04:39.869> frizz<00:04:40.229> or

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
cut down on any type of frizz or

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:45.079 
cut down on any type of frizz or
anything<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.949> I'm<00:04:44.459> just<00:04:44.609> going<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.849> repeat

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.089 
anything and I'm just going to repeat

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.289 
anything and I'm just going to repeat
all<00:04:45.569> over<00:04:45.989> her<00:04:46.079> hair<00:04:46.699> ok<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:47.759> I<00:04:47.879> took<00:04:47.939> all<00:04:48.179> her

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:48.299 
all over her hair ok so I took all her

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:50.509 
all over her hair ok so I took all her
bantu<00:04:48.689> knots<00:04:48.929> out<00:04:49.049> at<00:04:49.379> the<00:04:49.589> top<00:04:49.829> I<00:04:50.069> did<00:04:50.309> him<00:04:50.429> a

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:50.519 
bantu knots out at the top I did him a

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.159 
bantu knots out at the top I did him a
lot<00:04:50.729> smaller<00:04:51.059> you<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.419> remember<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:51.839> had<00:04:51.899> a<00:04:52.019> lot

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
lot smaller you I remember I had a lot

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.409 
lot smaller you I remember I had a lot
more<00:04:52.289> up<00:04:52.469> here<00:04:52.499> so<00:04:53.219> her<00:04:53.729> curls<00:04:54.089> are<00:04:54.209> a<00:04:54.239> lot<00:04:54.389> more

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
more up here so her curls are a lot more

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.179 
more up here so her curls are a lot more
defined<00:04:54.989> in<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.409> back<00:04:55.619> I<00:04:55.769> tried<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.039> do<00:04:56.159> a

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
defined in the back I tried to do a

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.709 
defined in the back I tried to do a
little<00:04:56.399> bit<00:04:56.579> bigger<00:04:56.819> I<00:04:57.089> should<00:04:57.269> probably<00:04:57.389> move

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
little bit bigger I should probably move

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.329 
little bit bigger I should probably move
a<00:04:57.809> bit<00:04:57.959> smaller<00:04:58.199> so<00:04:58.709> what<00:04:58.799> I'm<00:04:58.859> going<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.039> do<00:04:59.159> is

00:04:59.329 --> 00:04:59.339 
a bit smaller so what I'm going to do is

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.219 
a bit smaller so what I'm going to do is
go<00:04:59.519> through<00:04:59.549> and<00:04:59.969> separate<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:01.019> when<00:05:01.169> you

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
go through and separate and when you

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.569 
go through and separate and when you
separate<00:05:01.649> i'm<00:05:01.769> going<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:01.949> show<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.069> on<00:05:02.309> this

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:02.579 
separate i'm going to show you on this

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:03.949 
separate i'm going to show you on this
piece<00:05:02.909> since<00:05:03.059> you're<00:05:03.239> can<00:05:03.419> probably<00:05:03.749> see

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:03.959 
piece since you're can probably see

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:06.469 
piece since you're can probably see
better<00:05:04.519> separate<00:05:05.519> and<00:05:05.729> still<00:05:06.029> keep<00:05:06.299> the

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
better separate and still keep the

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.179 
better separate and still keep the
pattern<00:05:06.869> of<00:05:06.929> the<00:05:07.079> bands<00:05:07.289> who<00:05:07.439> not<00:05:07.619> going<00:05:07.889> so

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
pattern of the bands who not going so

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.359 
pattern of the bands who not going so
kind<00:05:08.489> of<00:05:08.579> curl<00:05:08.789> around<00:05:08.999> your<00:05:09.269> finger<00:05:09.629> and<00:05:10.369> then

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:11.369 
kind of curl around your finger and then

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:14.419 
kind of curl around your finger and then
you<00:05:11.459> let<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.639> go<00:05:12.649> and<00:05:13.649> you<00:05:13.709> see<00:05:13.860> how<00:05:13.979> i<00:05:14.009> split

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 
you let it go and you see how i split

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:16.249 
you let it go and you see how i split
that<00:05:14.579> but<00:05:14.789> she<00:05:14.939> still<00:05:15.149> has<00:05:15.209> a<00:05:15.360> defined<00:05:15.719> curl<00:05:16.049> so

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
that but she still has a defined curl so

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.809 
that but she still has a defined curl so
i'm<00:05:16.349> going<00:05:16.469> to<00:05:16.529> do<00:05:16.709> that<00:05:16.919> all<00:05:17.129> over<00:05:17.189> the<00:05:17.549> back

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
i'm going to do that all over the back

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.489 
i'm going to do that all over the back
and<00:05:18.269> then<00:05:18.419> believe<00:05:18.629> the<00:05:18.749> front<00:05:19.079> more<00:05:19.379> of<00:05:19.439> a

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
and then believe the front more of a

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.309 
and then believe the front more of a
chunky<00:05:19.889> bantu<00:05:20.219> knot<00:05:20.569> ok<00:05:21.569> guys<00:05:21.779> i'm<00:05:22.079> going<00:05:22.229> to

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
chunky bantu knot ok guys i'm going to

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.079 
chunky bantu knot ok guys i'm going to
split<00:05:22.589> this<00:05:22.769> last<00:05:23.069> car<00:05:23.369> just<00:05:23.549> showing<00:05:23.849> you<00:05:23.879> all

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:29.999 
split this last car just showing you all
my<00:05:24.119> camera<00:05:24.569> how<00:05:24.689> I<00:05:24.719> split<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.319> all<00:05:25.919> ages

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.570 

it<00:05:30.999> is<00:05:31.150> never<00:05:31.479> want<00:05:31.719> to<00:05:31.779> pull<00:05:31.990> straight<00:05:32.259> today

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
it is never want to pull straight today

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.920 
it is never want to pull straight today
let<00:05:33.580> me<00:05:33.610> just<00:05:33.909> wrap<00:05:34.059> it<00:05:34.119> around<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.569> direction

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
let me just wrap it around the direction

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.129 
let me just wrap it around the direction
of<00:05:35.139> them<00:05:37.889> just<00:05:38.889> split<00:05:39.309> it<00:05:39.610> in<00:05:40.300> half<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.749> curl

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
of them just split it in half and curl

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.260 
of them just split it in half and curl
in<00:05:41.319> direction<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.889> curl<00:05:42.099> like<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:42.999> and

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
in direction of the curl like that and

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.540 
in direction of the curl like that and
then<00:05:43.689> you<00:05:43.809> see<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.169> part<00:05:44.529> right<00:05:44.649> here<00:05:44.830> if<00:05:45.490> you

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
then you see this part right here if you

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.269 
then you see this part right here if you
want<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.849> get<00:05:45.939> rid<00:05:46.029> of<00:05:46.089> this<00:05:46.210> part<00:05:46.569> I<00:05:47.069> if<00:05:48.069> you

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
want to get rid of this part I if you

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.950 
want to get rid of this part I if you
maybe<00:05:48.550> eventually<00:05:48.969> not<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.330> can<00:05:49.569> do<00:05:49.719> it<00:05:49.839> in

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
maybe eventually not you can do it in

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.600 
maybe eventually not you can do it in
windows<00:05:50.139> to<00:05:50.499> avoid<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.889> part<00:05:51.099> that<00:05:51.249> and<00:05:51.490> do

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
windows to avoid the part that and do

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.619 
windows to avoid the part that and do
that<00:05:51.819> so<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:52.419> can<00:05:52.659> just<00:05:52.689> pin<00:05:54.270> put<00:05:55.270> a<00:05:55.300> bobby<00:05:55.539> pin

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
that so you can just pin put a bobby pin

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.369 
that so you can just pin put a bobby pin
in<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.110> middle<00:05:56.729> and<00:05:57.809> then<00:05:58.809> as<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.050> day<00:05:59.199> goes

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
in the middle and then as the day goes

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.019 
in the middle and then as the day goes
on<00:05:59.439> the<00:05:59.889> part<00:06:00.129> will<00:06:00.249> go<00:06:00.369> away<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:00.639> could<00:06:00.909> take

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029 
on the part will go away you could take

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.529 
on the part will go away you could take
it<00:06:01.149> out<00:06:01.240> as<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.449> want<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:03.159> that's<00:06:03.969> that<00:06:04.240> so

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
it out as you want and that's that so

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.760 
it out as you want and that's that so
from<00:06:04.749> here<00:06:04.899> you<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.110> kind<00:06:05.349> of<00:06:05.379> do<00:06:05.529> what<00:06:05.649> you

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
from here you can kind of do what you

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.579 
from here you can kind of do what you
want<00:06:06.009> if<00:06:06.069> you<00:06:06.099> want<00:06:06.339> to<00:06:06.430> do<00:06:06.610> an<00:06:06.939> updo<00:06:07.839> or<00:06:07.899> mohawk

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
want if you want to do an updo or mohawk

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.980 
want if you want to do an updo or mohawk
or<00:06:08.649> whatever<00:06:09.099> you<00:06:09.309> can<00:06:09.460> do<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:09.879> at<00:06:10.360> night<00:06:10.779> to

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
maintain the style you can either put in

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.459 
maintain the style you can either put in
