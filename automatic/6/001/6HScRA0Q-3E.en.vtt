00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to do is cut them on a slight angle like

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
to do is cut them on a slight angle like
this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.950 
this
well<00:01:07.020> I've<00:01:07.080> cut<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> stem<00:01:08.299> this<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.540> allow

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
well I've cut the stem this will allow

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.679 
well I've cut the stem this will allow
for<00:01:09.990> greater<00:01:10.710> water<00:01:11.189> uptake<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> take<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
for greater water uptake and I take the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.830 
for greater water uptake and I take the
excess<00:01:13.530> foliage<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.600> never

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
excess foliage off so because I never

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
excess foliage off so because I never
want<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> foliage<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> water<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
want the foliage in the water and then I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
want the foliage in the water and then I
bring<00:01:18.900> them<00:01:19.080> indoors<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
