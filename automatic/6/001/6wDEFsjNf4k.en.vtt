 very good to all guys that such as 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.980
 you are welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.570
 days and a goltv 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.460
 I am being that you can find me in 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.840
 twitter for at is new 10 in this 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.000
 video I want to recommend something that I 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.180
 fascinates or a cydia tweet that is called 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.279
 slow script mod mod is a pretty test 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.840
 pimp that is completely free that is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.689
 is available in the repository of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.060
 beatbox is compatible with ios 7 and that 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.160
 allows us to put the options of the slow 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.250
 motion that has the iphone 5 s in 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.540
 any device of it is something 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.940
 fantastic for example my iphone 5 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.519
 it works wonders and is the same 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.170
 functionality that the iphone 5 s has in 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.059
 the native camera application we have 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.590
 the slow motion as we are going to see now 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.010
 good to see that there is a characteristic 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.949
 Here it tells us that the iphone 4 4 â€‹â€‹s ipad 2 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.899
 and 3 do not support 60 frames per second in 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.969
 your camera therefore we have to go to 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.980
 the settings and put it in 30 seconds 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.420
 as it puts us here we will not see a 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.739
 bit the adjustments first we're going to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.390
 the camera application for you to see 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.880
 see what we see in the settings 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.290
 we have here slow as mod and from here 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.480
 well simply here if we have a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.210
 good different device we have a 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.140
 iphone 4 4 and ipad 2 or 3 we have to 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.729
 put here 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.950
 agree that this is the frames by 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.500
 second simply that you notice that here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.120
 we have the settings of this tweet like 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 it comes by default it really works very 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.229
 ok let's go the application of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.180
 camera so you can see a little where 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.220
 we have the novelties set that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.840
 making soft we are going to move and here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.330
 we see the same option that we have 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.970
 in 5 it is in the slow motion option 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 and later we will be able to edit 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.810
 then the video that we record with 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.940
 slow motion and put the clip that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.770
 we want to our taste 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.990
 in slow motion in slow motion something 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.090
 really fantastic to be able to integrate this 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 functionality that has the 5 that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.479
 really is integrated into ios but that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.240
 we can free it with this fantastic 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.619
 tuit de cydia a very recommended tweet 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.750

 users mostly of iphone 5 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.170
 because it really works very well 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.789
