over<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.359> June<00:00:00.539> bank<00:00:00.840> holiday<00:00:01.170> weekend<00:00:01.589> and

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
over the June bank holiday weekend and

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.039 
over the June bank holiday weekend and
in<00:00:02.190> 2011<00:00:02.730> people<00:00:03.240> would<00:00:03.389> have<00:00:03.480> noticed<00:00:03.870> that

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
in 2011 people would have noticed that

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.570 
in 2011 people would have noticed that
BBC<00:00:05.040> HD<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.150> BBC<00:00:06.359> One<00:00:06.690> HD<00:00:07.099> went<00:00:08.099> missing<00:00:08.429> off

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
BBC HD and BBC One HD went missing off

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.209 
BBC HD and BBC One HD went missing off
their<00:00:09.090> HD<00:00:09.570> receivers<00:00:10.170> okay<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.099> reason

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
their HD receivers okay and the reason

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.430 
their HD receivers okay and the reason
for<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.849> normally<00:00:12.840> when<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.080> happens

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
for this is normally when this happens

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.230 
for this is normally when this happens
it's<00:00:13.590> because<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:14.190> say<00:00:14.370> he<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.089> press

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
it's because would say he was press

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.670 
it's because would say he was press
reaction<00:00:15.450> awfulness<00:00:15.900> oh<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.289> goodness<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
reaction awfulness oh my goodness to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
reaction awfulness oh my goodness to
shop<00:00:16.830> around<00:00:16.949> her<00:00:17.190> box<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.609> dish<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.210> in

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
shop around her box in my dish but in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
shop around her box in my dish but in
this<00:00:18.420> case<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.890> normally

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
this case here it's just that normally

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.560 
this case here it's just that normally
occurs<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.760> there's<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> frequency<00:00:21.359> change

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
occurs when there's a frequency change

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
occurs when there's a frequency change
and<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.109> case<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.529> rather<00:00:22.710> unusual

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and in this case it's rather unusual

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.710 
and in this case it's rather unusual
because<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:23.910> actually<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.359> symbol

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
because it was actually just a symbol

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
because it was actually just a symbol
rate<00:00:24.869> change<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:26.039> why<00:00:26.340> PPC<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.090> not

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
rate change and now why PPC this I'm not

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
rate change and now why PPC this I'm not
quite<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.199> frequency<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
quite sure but the frequency and the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
quite sure but the frequency and the
polarization<00:00:29.519> stay<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> same<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> normally

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
polarization stay the same and normally

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
polarization stay the same and normally
on<00:00:31.830> satellite<00:00:32.309> receivers<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.870> symbol

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on satellite receivers and the symbol

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.810 
on satellite receivers and the symbol
refused<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.950> always<00:00:35.730> either<00:00:35.880> 22,000<00:00:36.840> are

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
refused is always either 22,000 are

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
refused is always either 22,000 are
27,500<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.180> BBC<00:00:39.690> I've<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.170> decided<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
27,500 but BBC I've now decided the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.319 
27,500 but BBC I've now decided the
broadcaster<00:00:41.340> HD<00:00:41.790> channels<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.800> 23,000<00:00:43.800> okay

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
broadcaster HD channels on 23,000 okay

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.190 
broadcaster HD channels on 23,000 okay
so<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.420> quickly<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> demonstrate

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
so I'm just quickly going to demonstrate

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
so I'm just quickly going to demonstrate
here<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> box<00:00:47.010> where<00:00:47.280> they've<00:00:47.399> gone<00:00:47.610> missing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
here on a box where they've gone missing

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930 
here on a box where they've gone missing
how<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> tune<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> mckeon<00:00:49.260> okay<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.129> I've<00:00:50.730> come

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
how to tune the mckeon okay so I've come

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.250 
how to tune the mckeon okay so I've come
along<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.600> looking<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:51.989> BBC

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
along here is we're just looking at BBC

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
along here is we're just looking at BBC
and<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> BBC<00:00:53.520> HD<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.840> do

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and we think out the BBC HD and what do

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
and we think out the BBC HD and what do
we<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.100> wouldn't<00:00:56.340> sure<00:00:56.489> anybody

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we see like this wouldn't sure anybody

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
we see like this wouldn't sure anybody
else<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.719> relatively<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.230> food<00:00:58.829> now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
else so it's relatively easy food now

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.619 
else so it's relatively easy food now
it'll<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.550> slightly<00:00:59.789> different<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> terms<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it'll be slightly different in terms of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.180 
it'll be slightly different in terms of
the<00:01:00.690> menus<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> different<00:01:01.410> boxes<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the menus in different boxes but it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
the menus in different boxes but it's
pretty<00:01:02.399> simple<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.210> okay<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.870> we're

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
pretty simple to do this okay what we're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.299 
pretty simple to do this okay what we're
gonna<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> we're<00:01:04.920> simply<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to

press the menu button here and just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
press the menu button here and just
press<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> menu<00:01:11.070> button<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.729> I've<00:01:12.540> come<00:01:12.780> over

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
press the menu button and I've come over

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.890 
press the menu button and I've come over
here<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.890> channel<00:01:14.580> search<00:01:14.820> will<00:01:15.540> come<00:01:15.689> down

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
here to an channel search will come down

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.820 
here to an channel search will come down
as<00:01:16.140> far<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:17.250> satellite<00:01:17.909> set<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:19.740> we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
as far as a satellite set up and what we

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
as far as a satellite set up and what we
need<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.759> need<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> actually

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
need to do here is we need to actually

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.080 
need to do here is we need to actually
go<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.710> transponder<00:01:23.340> list<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
go in to the transponder list so we can

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.550 
go in to the transponder list so we can
see<00:01:24.240> transponders<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> go

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see transponders we just had to go

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
see transponders we just had to go
through<00:01:25.710> button<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
through button so we're going here and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.980 
through button so we're going here and
the<00:01:28.020> cars<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.500> say<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the cars would say and we're on that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
the cars would say and we're on that
particular<00:01:31.200> channel<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> blank<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.280> can

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
particular channel the blank one we can

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.710 
particular channel the blank one we can
see<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> current<00:01:33.000> frequency<00:01:33.509> being

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
see that the current frequency being

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.270 
see that the current frequency being
used<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> 108<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.610> seven<00:01:36.060> vertical<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
used is 108 for seven vertical and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
used is 108 for seven vertical and
22,000<00:01:38.280> okay<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
want to either edit our ad on a new
transponder<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> press<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
transponder so I'm going to press the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.350 
transponder so I'm going to press the
red<00:01:45.180> button<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.610> asked<00:01:47.970> me<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
red button here and it asked me for the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
red button here and it asked me for the
ad<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> frequency<00:01:49.979> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
ad is in so I know what the frequency is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
ad is in so I know what the frequency is
the<00:01:50.070> same<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.880> signal<00:01:51.240> rate<00:01:51.390> should<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.720> put

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the same the signal rate should be put

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.100 
the same the signal rate should be put
to<00:01:52.399> 23,000<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> polarization<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to 23,000 and then the polarization is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
to 23,000 and then the polarization is
same<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.219> interesting<00:01:56.520> thing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
same but this is an interesting thing

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.340 
same but this is an interesting thing
now<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> symbol<00:01:57.689> rate<00:01:57.780> being<00:01:58.049> changed

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
now about the symbol rate being changed

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.399 
now about the symbol rate being changed
okay<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.610> see<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.930> transponder

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
okay so we can see that this transponder

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.899 
okay so we can see that this transponder
is<00:02:01.710> definitely<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.219> than<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> old<00:02:02.579> one

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
is definitely different than the old one

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
is definitely different than the old one
because<00:02:03.210> symbol<00:02:03.750> rate<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.020> different<00:02:04.170> okay

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
because symbol rate is different okay

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.410 
because symbol rate is different okay
but<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.280> come<00:02:05.490> along<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> save<00:02:06.240> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
but if I come along here to save this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.630 
but if I come along here to save this
and<00:02:06.630> press<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> okay<00:02:06.960> button<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.770> say<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.429> said

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and press the okay button and say I said

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.790 
and press the okay button and say I said
tell<00:02:08.910> me<00:02:08.940> confirm<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.349> transponder<00:02:10.890> exists

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
tell me confirm this transponder exists

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.730 
tell me confirm this transponder exists
okay<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.540> what's<00:02:13.720> actually<00:02:13.870> saying<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.470> it's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
okay so what's actually saying is it's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.960 
okay so what's actually saying is it's
not<00:02:14.950> seen<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> symbol<00:02:15.550> or<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.880> been

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
not seen the symbol or it's been

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.730 
not seen the symbol or it's been
different<00:02:16.270> now<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.660> some<00:02:16.870> boxes<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.410> will<00:02:17.560> on

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
different now in some boxes it will on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.350 
different now in some boxes it will on
this<00:02:17.830> particular<00:02:18.070> one<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.520> won't<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.270> is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
this particular one it won't and this is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.270 
this particular one it won't and this is
why<00:02:19.450> we've<00:02:19.600> picked<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:19.960> box<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.920> what<00:02:21.160> we'll

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
why we've picked this box so what we'll

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.450 
why we've picked this box so what we'll
do<00:02:21.400> here<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.670> we'll<00:02:21.850> simply<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.210> exit<00:02:22.630> there

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
do here is we'll simply just exit there

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.070 
do here is we'll simply just exit there
and<00:02:24.460> we'll<00:02:24.790> come<00:02:24.910> back<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:25.240> here<00:02:25.270> how<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.690> do<00:02:25.930> is

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and we'll come back up here how to do is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.870 
and we'll come back up here how to do is
but<00:02:26.380> actually<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.680> changed<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> last<00:02:27.460> digit

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
but actually just changed the last digit

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.940 
but actually just changed the last digit
of<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> frequency<00:02:28.510> from<00:02:29.020> four<00:02:29.290> seven<00:02:29.710> two

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
of the frequency from four seven two

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.040 
of the frequency from four seven two
four<00:02:30.130> six<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.330> sufficient<00:02:31.750> for<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.990> to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
four six so this is sufficient for it to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.960 
four six so this is sufficient for it to
be<00:02:32.110> able<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.320> find<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.710> HD<00:02:33.070> channels<00:02:33.460> but<00:02:33.760> for

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
be able to find the HD channels but for

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.760 
be able to find the HD channels but for
the<00:02:34.270> setup<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> actually<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.740> a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
the setup to actually see it as a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.070 
the setup to actually see it as a
different<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.460> box<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.510> know<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.960> is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
different and box and we know this is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.480 
different and box and we know this is
going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.320> work<00:02:38.380> because<00:02:38.890> if<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.190> look<00:02:39.340> at<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
going to work because if we look at the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.250 
going to work because if we look at the
quality<00:02:39.640> strength<00:02:40.150> down<00:02:40.300> here<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.840> still<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
quality strength down here it still is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.380 
quality strength down here it still is
picking<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.890> background<00:02:42.340> signal<00:02:42.550> here<00:02:42.910> so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
picking up a background signal here so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.270 
picking up a background signal here so
we<00:02:43.570> do<00:02:43.690> with<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.900> particular<00:02:44.140> point<00:02:44.530> Imus<00:02:44.950> we

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
we do with this particular point Imus we

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.020 
we do with this particular point Imus we
simply<00:02:45.550> come<00:02:45.700> along<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.420> press<00:02:46.660> okay<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
simply come along and I press okay and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060 
simply come along and I press okay and
now<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> scan<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> see<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.920> blue

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
now we can do a scan so to see the blue

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
now we can do a scan so to see the blue
button<00:02:51.400> here<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.880> press<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.960> this

and it's quickly scan just another one

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
and it's quickly scan just another one
transponder<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.020> we'll<00:03:11.170> see<00:03:11.350> it's<00:03:11.590> pulled<00:03:11.830> in

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
transponder so we'll see it's pulled in

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.940 
transponder so we'll see it's pulled in

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
that point then it's just a matter of

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.830 
that point then it's just a matter of
actually<00:03:33.130> coming<00:03:33.550> along<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.940> deleting<00:03:34.660> the

password it's not only four zeros in
this<00:03:49.270> guess<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.630> six<00:03:49.840> zeros<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.680> we'll<00:03:50.890> just

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
this guess is six zeros and we'll just

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.520 
this guess is six zeros and we'll just
choose<00:03:52.000> let's<00:03:52.330> say<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.630> hit<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.350> blue

okay<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.340> find<00:04:06.820> certain<00:04:07.090> boxes<00:04:07.660> again<00:04:07.959> if

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
okay now I find certain boxes again if

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
okay now I find certain boxes again if
it<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:08.890> let's<00:04:09.280> say<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.459> child<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.820> looking<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
it so let's say the child is looking the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.520 
it so let's say the child is looking the
same<00:04:10.209> or<00:04:10.510> sings<00:04:10.690> at<00:04:10.810> this<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
same or sings at this and the the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.110 
same or sings at this and the the
seconds<00:04:11.890> were<00:04:12.010> almost<00:04:12.190> identical<00:04:12.400> would

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
seconds were almost identical would

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.670 
seconds were almost identical would
actually<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> channel<00:04:14.140> automatically

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
actually the channel automatically

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.170 
actually the channel automatically
back<00:04:14.830> in<00:04:15.010> for<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.310> but<00:04:15.640> that's<00:04:15.700> not<00:04:15.850> how<00:04:16.120> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
back in for you but that's not how it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.699 
back in for you but that's not how it
was<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> case<00:04:16.600> for<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.959> front<00:04:17.230> once<00:04:17.440> again

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
was the case for this front once again

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.320 
was the case for this front once again
it's<00:04:18.160> probably<00:04:18.430> good<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.730> demonstrate<00:04:19.239> in

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
it's probably good to demonstrate in

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.420 
it's probably good to demonstrate in
this<00:04:19.480> just<00:04:19.960> press<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.290> move<00:04:20.440> button<00:04:20.710> here<00:04:20.919> and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
this just press the move button here and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.700 
this just press the move button here and
we'll<00:04:21.549> just<00:04:21.700> move<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:22.120> down<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.710> position

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
we'll just move this down to position

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.190 
we'll just move this down to position
everyone

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
everyone

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.760 
everyone
that's<00:04:24.860> okay<00:04:25.280> come<00:04:26.180> back<00:04:26.330> up<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.020> grab<00:04:27.620> this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that's okay come back up and grab this

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.890 
that's okay come back up and grab this
particular<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.340> here<00:04:28.600> hit<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.720> red<00:04:29.870> button

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
particular one here hit the red button

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.850 
particular one here hit the red button
again<00:04:30.230> move<00:04:30.860> down<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.960> we'll<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.710> in

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
again move down and we'll it in

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.460 
again move down and we'll it in
just<00:04:34.610> afterwards<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.180> that's<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.900> then

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
just afterwards and that's it and then

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.950 
just afterwards and that's it and then
exit<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:37.310> now<00:04:37.460> we<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:37.790> all<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.210> HD<00:04:38.570> channels

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
exit so now we have all the HD channels

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.420 
exit so now we have all the HD channels
back<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.440> that's<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:39.890> it's<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.070> relatively

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
back and that's it so it's a relatively

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.580 
back and that's it so it's a relatively
simple<00:04:40.700> process<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.660> hopefully<00:04:41.870> people<00:04:42.320> find

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
simple process and hopefully people find

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.080 
simple process and hopefully people find
this<00:04:42.710> video<00:04:42.920> useful<00:04:43.070> in<00:04:43.550> ensuring<00:04:43.970> their

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
this video useful in ensuring their

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.750 
this video useful in ensuring their
