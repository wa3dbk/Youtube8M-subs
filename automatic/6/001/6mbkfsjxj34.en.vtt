00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:25.680
 different colors of paper and what 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.689
 if we make a birthday card 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.689
 I draw on the big paper 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:43.640
 tractor 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:46.640
 I wanted her to be two in the middle 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 parts 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 A truck tour is about the way you can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:02.270
 that too with linear make that is the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:12.590
 front side up 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:15.830
 The window is actually quite simple 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 to draw 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:34.850
 on the front of the window here 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.310
 I'm doing with the bright front 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 paper what I had 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.990
 You can cut out the wheels like that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:02:08.250
 [Applause] 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:12.349
 of course, is to talk one sees 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.349
 can make that a little day became 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 cut out 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:28.370
 you can always take that as a template 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 click for the next place cards 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:49.969
 who deserves it says kind the boys so 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:03:15.549
 you can still cut the window 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:03:18.549
 quite simply the window comparison 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 isolated 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:52.510
 so you can also take a circle for 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:56.739
 The rounding I do it by hand 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.739
 take once is great 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:44.110
 and the small as I said with circle 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:49.810
 now the rounding is better or you 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:59.919
 can also take a two-euro piece that 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:17.979
 Front wheel further up 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:22.539
 the little one has my turn in front 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:31.020
 nice birthday card for the 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:31.020
 birthday girls want to write names
