 can be used either the one who buys 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.030
 in the supermarket that after the chicken 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.439
 sin it's time to heat the pan 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.530

 the very tasty chicken onion in the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.360
 Let's put the pieces of the chicken 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.090
 the liver stays out for now 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.640
 because the liver with the family goes 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.840
 process will tell if it will give a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.810
 good start 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.490
 Is not the seasoning the same now? 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.539

 oil and seasoning in the pan and the water that goes 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.769
 use in polenta is already a cold water even 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.590
 you need to cool cold water because 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.810
 We will mix the cornmeal in like 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.769
 because the station she in the hot water she 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.500

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:56.950
