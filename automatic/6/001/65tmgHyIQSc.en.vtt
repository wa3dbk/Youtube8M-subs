00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.349
 good afternoon to i last names really 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 tire today I will tell you how 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 independently and accurately check the flow 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.800
 on your spleen 90 percent then 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 fans are guided by the testimony 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 onboard computer but your onboard 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 computer is nothing more than a calculator 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.460
 whose testimony has no 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.080
 relationship to real expenses there 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 many ways to check 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 real fuel consumption official 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 dealer from but we are not about that now 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 check the flow yourself 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.460
 I suggest to conduct a small experiment 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 and the first condition of the experiment is the absence 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 things your trunk 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 no grandmother's argus and bags 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.620
 cement should not be there you will 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 laugh but the automaker for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 purity experiment unscrew even 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.170
 antenna to reduce resistance 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.840
 air but we are at such extremes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.039
 will not go down the next step is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 refueling your car 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 occupation for refill put the gun in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.260
 tank 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 remember the tooth you put on 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 gun tuck before the cutoff is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.220
 let you understand that the tank is full 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 to failure under the terms of the experiment in 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 the cabin of your car should 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 there is only one passenger in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.189
 the car must be turned off 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.470
 all additional equipment 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 leaving only the dipped headlights and airflow 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 fan at second speed if all 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.740
 the conditions are met then you have the task 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.760
 it is necessary to go to dry weather 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.979
 country track 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.290
 just drive 15 kilometers to one 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.670
 side turn and drive 15 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.159
 meters the other way in order 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.920
 compensate for the wind we drive in 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.050
 at the gas station we put on the same gun on 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.119
 the same prong and refuel up 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.250
 cutoff amount of spent gasoline 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.380
 we divide by the number of opposite ways 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.970
 so we get real fuel consumption 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.460
 right here you will need 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 calculator with you was you tire 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.970
 see you soon
