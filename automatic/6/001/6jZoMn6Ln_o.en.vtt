00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
have experienced a blade slowing down

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.570 
have experienced a blade slowing down
when<00:00:15.839> they're<00:00:15.990> making<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> cut<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> first

when they're making a cut so the first

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
when they're making a cut so the first
thing<00:00:17.789> everybody<00:00:18.150> says<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> motor

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
thing everybody says is that the motor

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.800 
thing everybody says is that the motor
is<00:00:19.260> junk<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> real<00:00:20.939> fix<00:00:21.270> takes<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.350> wrench

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
is junk but the real fix takes a wrench

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
is junk but the real fix takes a wrench
first<00:00:24.810> let's<00:00:25.050> show<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> problem<00:00:25.980> I've

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
first let's show you the problem I've

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.029 
first let's show you the problem I've
loosened<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.820> belt<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.390> PM<00:00:27.720> mm<00:00:28.439> moving

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
loosened the belt on my PM mm moving

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.470 
loosened the belt on my PM mm moving
them<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.279> about<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> quarter<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:30.390> inch

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
them on about a quarter of an inch

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:45.870 
them on about a quarter of an inch
towards<00:00:30.960> lucite<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> takes

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.250 

now<00:00:46.880> let's<00:00:47.120> tighten<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.510> belt<00:00:47.720> up<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.110> show

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
now let's tighten the belt up and show

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.890 
now let's tighten the belt up and show
you<00:00:48.320> what's<00:00:48.560> involved<00:00:48.890> there<00:00:49.450> I've<00:00:50.450> taken<00:00:50.720> a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
you what's involved there I've taken a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.690 
you what's involved there I've taken a
side<00:00:51.110> door<00:00:51.350> off<00:00:51.559> because<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.160> just<00:00:52.280> makes<00:00:52.520> it

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
side door off because it just makes it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000 
side door off because it just makes it
easier<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.420> see<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.750> on<00:00:53.960> video<00:00:54.350> PM

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
easier for you to see this on video PM

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.010 
easier for you to see this on video PM
2000<00:00:55.610> owners<00:00:55.850> know<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.360> just<00:00:56.570> lifts<00:00:56.870> off

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
2000 owners know that it just lifts off

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.160 
2000 owners know that it just lifts off
in<00:00:57.170> these<00:00:57.290> hinges<00:00:58.180> when<00:00:59.180> you<00:00:59.300> open<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> door

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
in these hinges when you open the door

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.590 
in these hinges when you open the door
the<00:01:00.830> motor<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.340> its<00:01:01.580> mounts<00:01:02.030> are<00:01:02.210> readily

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the motor and its mounts are readily

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.910 
the motor and its mounts are readily
accessible<00:01:03.050> this<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.830> real<00:01:04.129> easy<00:01:04.400> fix<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
accessible this is a real easy fix the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560 
accessible this is a real easy fix the
first<00:01:07.130> thing<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> check<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.119> poly<00:01:08.330> V

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
first thing to check is that the poly V

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.359 
first thing to check is that the poly V
belt<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:09.110> actually<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.860> pulley

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
belt is actually on the pulley

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.450 
belt is actually on the pulley
and<00:01:10.460> in<00:01:10.729> grooves<00:01:11.090> correctly<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and in grooves correctly this is the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.430 
and in grooves correctly this is the
upper<00:01:13.820> pivot<00:01:14.150> point<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.600> motor<00:01:14.810> mount<00:01:15.050> so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
upper pivot point in a motor mount so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.109 
upper pivot point in a motor mount so
far<00:01:15.650> I've<00:01:15.770> not<00:01:15.830> had<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.340> loosen<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.970> make

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
far I've not had to loosen that to make

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.980
