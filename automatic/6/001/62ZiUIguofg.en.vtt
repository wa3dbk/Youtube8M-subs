so right side actions nits and pearls

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
so right side actions nits and pearls
these<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.640> stitches<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.719> row<00:00:48.870> were

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
these two stitches in the first row were

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.299 
these two stitches in the first row were
just<00:00:49.200> knits<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.010> they're<00:00:50.219> going

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
just knits but you can see they're going

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.930 
just knits but you can see they're going
to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.430> twists<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.050> higher<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.940> then

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to be twists when we get higher up then

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.869 
to be twists when we get higher up then
we<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.270> pearls<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.739> inside<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.520> box

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we have pearls and then inside this box

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.770 
we have pearls and then inside this box
is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:58.079> repeat<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.129> cable<00:00:59.539> lattice<00:01:00.539> pattern

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is a repeat of a cable lattice pattern

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
is a repeat of a cable lattice pattern
that<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.500> add<00:01:01.859> additional<00:01:02.070> repeats<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that you can add additional repeats to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840 
that you can add additional repeats to
make<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> pattern<00:01:03.750> wider<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> let's<00:01:05.700> get

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
make this pattern wider so let's get

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
make this pattern wider so let's get
started<00:01:06.270> what's<00:01:06.450> within<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> box<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.530> first

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
started what's within the box the first

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.210 
started what's within the box the first
the<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.159> pearls<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> these<00:01:10.260> next<00:01:10.890> four

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the two pearls and then these next four

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.870 
the two pearls and then these next four
stitches<00:01:12.470> represent<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> four<00:01:14.040> stitch<00:01:14.340> cable

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
stitches represent a four stitch cable

stitches represent a four stitch cable
and<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.560> tell<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.070> looking<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.790> how

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and you can tell by looking at how

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.560 
and you can tell by looking at how
they're<00:01:18.450> written<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:20.610> even<00:01:20.909> without<00:01:21.270> any

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the first two stitches do and in what

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
the first two stitches do and in what
the<00:01:26.159> second<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.360> leans

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the second two so you can see this leans

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.770 
the second two so you can see this leans
to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.829> hand<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.420> first

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to the right hand side and that first

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
to the right hand side and that first
little<00:01:31.079> leg<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.740> tell<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.430> your

to pull these next two stitches are
going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.939> knitted<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.299> next<00:01:54.630> two

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
going to be knitted the next two

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
going to be knitted the next two
stitches<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.200> knitted<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.579> go

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
stitches get knitted and then you go

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
stitches get knitted and then you go
back<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> cable<00:01:57.899> needle<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.399> knit<00:01:59.399> those

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
back to the cable needle and knit those

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.750 
back to the cable needle and knit those
two<00:01:59.969> stitches

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.610 

and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.690> course<00:02:03.720> we're<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> finish

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
and then of course we're going to finish

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.800 
and then of course we're going to finish
out<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> row<00:02:05.280> remembering<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.210> little

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
out the row remembering these little

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
out the row remembering these little
knit<00:02:06.990> stitches<00:02:07.260> are<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.160> become<00:02:08.430> twists

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
knit stitches are going to become twists

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.450 
knit stitches are going to become twists
later<00:02:09.210> on<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.680> finish<00:02:11.010> off<00:02:11.190> our

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
later on and then we finish off our

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.930 
later on and then we finish off our
right<00:02:12.240> side<00:02:12.510> row<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.550> we're<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
right side row so now we're going to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
right side row so now we're going to
work<00:02:15.210> back<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.870> our<00:02:16.140> even-numbered<00:02:17.010> wrong

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
work back on our even-numbered wrong

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.490 
work back on our even-numbered wrong
side<00:02:17.640> row<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.600> knit<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> pearls

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
side row it's all knit and pearls

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.220 
side row it's all knit and pearls
because<00:02:20.010> remember<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.930> twisting<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
because remember the twisting and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.900 
because remember the twisting and
cabling<00:02:22.770> action<00:02:23.190> all<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.870> odd-numbered

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
cabling action all on the odd-numbered

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.200 
cabling action all on the odd-numbered
front<00:02:26.910> side<00:02:27.150> rows<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.580> even<00:02:29.970> numbered

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
front side rows so the even numbered

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.310 
front side rows so the even numbered
rows<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:30.840> quick<00:02:31.110> no<00:02:31.980> cabling<00:02:33.320> so

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
rows are really quick no cabling so

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.020 
rows are really quick no cabling so
let's<00:02:34.860> get<00:02:35.070> started<00:02:35.490> now<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.940> our<00:02:36.510> first<00:02:36.960> twist

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
let's get started now on our first twist

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.290 
let's get started now on our first twist
so<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> looks<00:02:39.750> similar<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.710> cable

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
so you see it looks similar to a cable

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.610 
so you see it looks similar to a cable
except<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.540> only<00:02:42.960> two<00:02:43.380> stitches

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
except that it's only two stitches

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.520 
except that it's only two stitches
instead<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.640> four<00:02:45.180> or<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.450> stitches<00:02:46.170> which

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
instead of four or more stitches which

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.720 
instead of four or more stitches which
is<00:02:46.680> really<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> difference<00:02:47.310> between<00:02:47.400> cable

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
is really the difference between cable

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.450 
is really the difference between cable
and<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> twist<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.350> twist<00:02:49.800> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
and a twist this is a twist going to the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.100 
and a twist this is a twist going to the
left<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.250> first<00:02:53.880> action<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
left you can see the first action the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.290 
left you can see the first action the
little<00:02:55.410> bottom<00:02:55.770> thing<00:02:56.040> there<00:02:56.310> shows<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
little bottom thing there shows that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.700 
little bottom thing there shows that
we're<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> pull<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.810> forward<00:02:58.500> it's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
we're going to pull it forward it's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.790 
we're going to pull it forward it's
going<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.370> front<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:01.590> we're<00:03:01.710> going

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
going to be in the front so we're going

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.920 
going to be in the front so we're going
to<00:03:01.860> pull<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.310> stitch<00:03:02.550> forward<00:03:03.030> we're<00:03:03.840> going

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to pull this stitch forward we're going

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.410 
to pull this stitch forward we're going
to<00:03:03.990> knit<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.470> second<00:03:05.010> stitch<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:06.060> grab

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
to knit that second stitch and then grab

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
to knit that second stitch and then grab
that<00:03:06.450> first<00:03:06.870> stitch<00:03:07.110> back<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.800> needle<00:03:08.070> so

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
that first stitch back off the needle so

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.110 
that first stitch back off the needle so
now<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:10.500> four<00:03:11.190> stitch<00:03:11.520> actions

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
now we have two four stitch actions

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.000 
now we have two four stitch actions
side-by-side<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:16.080> they<00:03:16.290> look<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.770> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
side-by-side now they look just like the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.060 
side-by-side now they look just like the
cable<00:03:17.370> below<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.390> reverse<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.200> you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
cable below and the reverse of it you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.150 
cable below and the reverse of it you
can<00:03:20.220> see<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.520> little<00:03:20.820> leg<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
can see the little leg and then but it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.699 
can see the little leg and then but it
has<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> dot<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.970> what<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.660> dot<00:03:24.870> means<00:03:25.230> just

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
has a dot and what the dot means just

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.770 
has a dot and what the dot means just
like<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.160> purl<00:03:26.400> dots<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:27.060> means<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.630> you're

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
like the purl dots it means that you're

to work two and two on the cable needle

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.440 
to work two and two on the cable needle
it<00:03:39.630> slants<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.180> first

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
those two stitches on a cable needle

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.620 
those two stitches on a cable needle
hold<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.560> back<00:03:50.000> knit<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.180> next<00:03:51.330> two<00:03:51.600> stitches
