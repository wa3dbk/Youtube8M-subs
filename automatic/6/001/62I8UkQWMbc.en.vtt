00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 one together you still remember 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.230
 the 20 euro make up challenge is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.179
 a day last year was very much in and 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.139
 all beauty gurus have done that and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.370
 I'll have it someday 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.280
 participated the video does not exist anymore 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 but I really thought so 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 my favorite tech of all time was 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.250
 I turn a new version of it and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.600
 everything you can see here in my 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 I have face for under 20 euro 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320
 make-up you can super light 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880
 make-up is very suitable for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 the school has a very natural one 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.240
 look is and I wish you a lot 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 fun while watching first look 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 on my unvarnished face and then 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.430
 I start with a make up and that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.320
 with the albert in mineral makeup that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.210
 I have often mentioned because that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 really one of my favorite make- ups 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.140
 The drugstore is very nice 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 cheap and has a very nice finish 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 the finish is so half maz and that is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 That's why I'm so good today 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 I will not use any powder and that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 that the foundations and a bit 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 I have the feeling that I marked 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.430
 not necessarily need a powder 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.719
 she leaves a little bit glossy 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 the skin and therefore relatively 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 of course and a little tip if 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.719
 you want the foundation to last longer 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 I always try the foundation 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.350
 really good in the skin to press 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 So that's what I do today with the fingers 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.189
 and then the foundation keeps it whole 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 well then i use the eyeshadow of 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.159
 reval de luca 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 that's the legacy shadow in the color 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.290
 only three soft brown my dearest 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 eyeshadow colors at all I think 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 I somehow made that special 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 easy on the fingers 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 wear because it is still relatively bright 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 and she can be blinded beautiful 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 beautiful powdery consistency and very 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.470
 natural result then i use 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.270
 a black kajal of essens and me 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 use it as eyeliner replacement 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 I do not wear it on the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.579
 entire upper lid on but so until the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 middle way 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.020
 you'll be right in the next one 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 Recording see exactly here so I go 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.829
 really only so far with the kajalstift 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.049
 until I'm about the pupil 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.579
 arrive and then you see the here 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.680
 Difference right seen from me 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 the eye is not made up left so makeup 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 it is a huge difference but me 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.890
 am still the right eye is something 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.469
 more awake then I use mascara as the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 unfortunately extremely crazy volume mascara of 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.920
 I meanwhile come in 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.690
 a little better with it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.879
 I have a little tip for you and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 Although when the mascara clumps with you 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.390
 take a handkerchief and try it 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.560
 the excess ink a bit 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.300
 to strip it off 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.800
 after that the mascara does not clump 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.020
 more with me I mean that is 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.610
 waste and so on the scale issue 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.170
 not to be but I try 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.489
 just use them up and I think 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.670
 for the price it is still one 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.110
 good product because I mean something 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 one expects it already extended 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
 really good but it is not 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.069
 my favorite mascara but for today 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.840
 it's on the right side of me 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.510
 I mascara applied not so left 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.700
 as a little before after effect and 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.650
 Here you see that both eyes already 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 the same made-up are used afterwards 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 i had the manhattan paul rust enders 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.980
 in color 53 and fresh beatz 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 that is a very nice bright light 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 Shiny 4 yourself and I love you 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.489
 this rouge comes in handy 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.560
 also with a brush because of that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.209
 I also selected it for today 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.739
 Color is not that dark because of it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.690
 she also gets along quite well with this 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.590
 Apply brush without staining later 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.379
 look 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.700
 and I do not wear the rouge yet 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.280
 apple cheek but also such a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.330
 bit on the cheekbones and on 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.050
 I make it so circular 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.050
 Movements and I mean this brushing 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.970
 is not that great but it works 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.060
 then use eyebrow pencil from p2 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.560
 that the agro express in the bright 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.239
 color I do not remember what that means 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.920
 but it is definitely this whole 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.849
 bright color and I do not have any 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.099
 blond hair 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.900
 but i very much prefer bright ones 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.510
 eyebrow founder than these dark ones 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.030
 because I am always dark with formal 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.739
 and it always looks stupid in the end 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.709
 I am using this lost page completely 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.720
 the end you see now and blur 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.340
 so what I stick with the times you 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.010
 then it looks a bit more natural 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.220
 I can not live without it 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.930
 eyebrow donor puts it I use 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.760
 another lipstick from patrice that is 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.739
 the liar of patrice and i like the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 Great you can do the great without 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.700
 Mirror on wear because of the beautiful 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.590
 Of course, I'm my winner with everyone 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.349
 different but with me it will be 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.970
 very natural and that 's it in the end 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.129
 I like to wear each one of you 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.080
 I would like to take part in this challenge 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.940
 think that this 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 really makes sense in contrast to 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 many other tags i actually do 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.850
 not quite as great as I like to do 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.500
 find that this day really proof 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.270
 that with little money and little 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.220
 it took a nice complete make-up 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.230
 can make-up and I hope you give 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.330
 right again and you like that 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.890
 I made it, I believe we do 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.390
 see you soon again let me be happy 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.930
 a thumbs up and a comment there 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.930
 until then
