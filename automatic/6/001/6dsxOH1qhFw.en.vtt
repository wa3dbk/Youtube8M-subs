00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
hi folks we're gonna look at the

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.890 
hi folks we're gonna look at the
different<00:00:09.070> nano<00:00:09.280> shoes<00:00:09.580> that<00:00:10.360> Reebok<00:00:10.720> made

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
different nano shoes that Reebok made

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.170 
different nano shoes that Reebok made
I'm<00:00:11.620> just<00:00:11.860> gonna<00:00:12.010> simply<00:00:12.250> compare<00:00:12.730> actually

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
I'm just gonna simply compare actually

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.960 
I'm just gonna simply compare actually
Nana<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:13.660> it<00:00:13.870> nano<00:00:14.080> three<00:00:14.640> the<00:00:15.640> one<00:00:15.790> in<00:00:15.880> the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
Nana to it nano three the one in the

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.920 
Nana to it nano three the one in the
middle<00:00:16.119> is<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.510> woman's<00:00:16.840> very<00:00:17.500> popular<00:00:17.980> color

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
middle is the woman's very popular color

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.439 
middle is the woman's very popular color
nano<00:00:19.930> three<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.580> can<00:00:21.789> see<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.150> it's<00:00:22.300> a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
nano three you can see that it's a

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.790 
nano three you can see that it's a
little<00:00:22.720> skinnier<00:00:23.140> than<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.350> other<00:00:23.560> ones

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
little skinnier than the other ones

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.100 
little skinnier than the other ones

men's is always water a little bit but
um<00:00:26.410> pretty<00:00:27.369> light<00:00:27.640> shoe<00:00:27.850> and<00:00:28.090> all<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:28.359> we'll

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
um pretty light shoe and all that we'll

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.720 
um pretty light shoe and all that we'll
get<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.170> um<00:00:29.440> when<00:00:29.980> we<00:00:30.070> were<00:00:30.160> reviewing<00:00:30.310> it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
get to it um when we were reviewing it

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.210 
get to it um when we were reviewing it
actually<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:32.020> all<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:32.410> way<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.739> left<00:00:32.980> is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
actually and all the way to the left is

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180 
actually and all the way to the left is
the<00:00:33.489> nanotubes<00:00:34.510> I've<00:00:35.320> been<00:00:35.470> bruising<00:00:35.860> it<00:00:36.010> for

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the nanotubes I've been bruising it for

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.850 
the nanotubes I've been bruising it for
the<00:00:36.280> last<00:00:36.489> year<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:37.660> we'll<00:00:37.870> go<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.079> it<00:00:38.470> and<00:00:38.770> I'll

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
the last year so we'll go to it and I'll

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760 
the last year so we'll go to it and I'll
show<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.630> what's<00:00:40.630> good<00:00:40.809> about<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.530> what's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
show you what's good about it and what's

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.030 
show you what's good about it and what's
not<00:00:42.220> good<00:00:42.489> about<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:42.880> and<00:00:43.059> all<00:00:43.180> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
not good about it and all that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.580 
not good about it and all that
this<00:00:45.040> is<00:00:45.219> nano<00:00:45.700> 3<00:00:45.969> for<00:00:46.239> men<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:50.379> talk

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
this is nano 3 for men and we'll talk

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.709 
this is nano 3 for men and we'll talk
about<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:51.010> also<00:00:51.160> so<00:00:51.790> you<00:00:52.120> have<00:00:52.270> an<00:00:52.390> idea<00:00:52.660> now

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
about it also so you have an idea now

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.530 
about it also so you have an idea now
while<00:00:53.110> we're<00:00:53.290> relieving<00:00:54.360> okay<00:00:55.360> I'm<00:00:55.420> gonna

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
while we're relieving okay I'm gonna

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.090 
while we're relieving okay I'm gonna
start<00:00:55.840> with<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.079> nanotubes

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
start with the nanotubes

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.709 
start with the nanotubes
I<00:00:57.160> have<00:00:57.550> these<00:00:57.700> shoes<00:00:57.940> almost<00:00:58.149> a<00:00:58.450> year<00:00:58.629> now

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
I have these shoes almost a year now

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.470 
I have these shoes almost a year now
it's<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.590> great<00:00:59.770> shoe<00:01:00.070> if<00:01:00.850> you're<00:01:01.030> looking<00:01:01.329> for

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
it's a great shoe if you're looking for

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.299 
it's a great shoe if you're looking for
an<00:01:01.600> overall<00:01:01.870> CrossFit's<00:01:02.469> you<00:01:02.649> there<00:01:03.190> is

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
an overall CrossFit's you there is

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.609 
an overall CrossFit's you there is
nowhere<00:01:03.670> else<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:04.000> go<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.750> can<00:01:05.350> literally

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
nowhere else to go you can literally

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.850 
nowhere else to go you can literally
just<00:01:05.740> get<00:01:06.100> an<00:01:06.220> N<00:01:06.369> or<00:01:06.399> two<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.560> you'll<00:01:08.560> dodge<00:01:08.800> a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
just get an N or two and you'll dodge a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.850 
just get an N or two and you'll dodge a
little<00:01:09.280> higher<00:01:10.060> bill<00:01:10.360> on<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.660> nano<00:01:10.959> three<00:01:11.350> and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
little higher bill on the nano three and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.710 
little higher bill on the nano three and
you'll<00:01:12.069> be<00:01:12.160> just<00:01:12.369> fine<00:01:12.459> as<00:01:13.209> you<00:01:13.780> can<00:01:13.929> see<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:15.720> hit

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
you'll be just fine as you can see I hit

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.430 
you'll be just fine as you can see I hit
at<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.020> front<00:01:17.289> so<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:17.740> kind<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.009> like

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
at the front so it's kind of like

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.529 
at the front so it's kind of like
getting<00:01:20.440> me<00:01:20.530> there<00:01:20.709> I<00:01:21.030> mean<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.090> don't<00:01:22.149> even

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
getting me there I mean I don't even

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.350 
getting me there I mean I don't even
feel<00:01:22.869> this<00:01:23.080> but<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.470> grip<00:01:23.649> is<00:01:23.800> obviously<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
feel this but the grip is obviously you

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.070 
feel this but the grip is obviously you
can<00:01:25.539> see<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.780> wear<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.349> the<00:01:26.560> front<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.069> as

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
can see the wear at the front of it as

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.230 
can see the wear at the front of it as
versus<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.319> new<00:01:29.679> one<00:01:29.860> there's<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.700> different

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
versus a new one there's a different

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.770 
versus a new one there's a different
grip<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.410> compare<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> grip<00:01:33.539> they<00:01:34.539> gave

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
grip you can compare the grip they gave

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.190 
grip you can compare the grip they gave
it<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.959> more<00:01:35.170> grip<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.770> nano3<00:01:36.520> no<00:01:36.759> doubt<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.410 

I'm<00:01:41.200> sure<00:01:41.410> it's<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.770> awesome<00:01:42.009> as<00:01:42.310> nanotubes<00:01:43.149> if

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
I'm sure it's as awesome as nanotubes if

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.419 
I'm sure it's as awesome as nanotubes if
not<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.660> little<00:01:43.869> better<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.619> you're<00:01:45.130> looking

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
not a little better if you're looking

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.300 
not a little better if you're looking
for<00:01:45.580> like<00:01:45.759> huge<00:01:46.450> grip<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.020> year<00:01:47.289> one<00:01:48.220> of

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
for like huge grip on this year one of

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.490 
for like huge grip on this year one of
the<00:01:48.429> other<00:01:48.789> difference<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:51.179> that<00:01:52.500> you're

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
the other difference is that you're

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.169 
the other difference is that you're
gonna<00:01:53.590> see<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.099> let<00:01:54.369> me<00:01:54.459> give<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:54.910> one

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
gonna see that let me give you this one

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.320 
gonna see that let me give you this one
maybe<00:01:55.690> make<00:01:56.319> more<00:01:56.590> sense<00:01:56.860> if<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:57.849> can<00:01:58.000> see<00:01:58.209> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
maybe make more sense if you can see the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.419 
maybe make more sense if you can see the
cage<00:01:58.569> there's<00:01:59.349> protection<00:01:59.649> right<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.280> at

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
cage there's protection right here at

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.059 
cage there's protection right here at
the<00:02:00.550> front<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> shoe<00:02:01.179> of<00:02:01.300> Manitou<00:02:02.069> you

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
the front of the shoe of Manitou you

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.490 
the front of the shoe of Manitou you
still<00:02:03.280> got<00:02:03.459> that<00:02:03.489> but<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:04.539> also<00:02:04.660> on<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.170> top

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
still got that but then also on the top

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.460 
still got that but then also on the top
there<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.890> cage<00:02:06.190> where<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.020> feed<00:02:08.020> gets<00:02:08.259> more

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
there is a cage where you feed gets more

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.460 
there is a cage where you feed gets more
protection<00:02:09.009> instead<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.509> mesh

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
protection instead of this just a mesh

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.510 
protection instead of this just a mesh
and<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.280> still<00:02:12.520> breeds<00:02:12.790> fine<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:15.160> fronts

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
and it still breeds fine so the fronts

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.450 
and it still breeds fine so the fronts
are<00:02:15.640> pretty<00:02:15.880> comparable<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:17.710> far<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> back

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
are pretty comparable as far as the back

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.810 
are pretty comparable as far as the back
of<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.760> she<00:02:18.910> goes<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:21.100> really<00:02:21.340> connect<00:02:21.580> this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
of the she goes you really connect this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.860 
of the she goes you really connect this
difference<00:02:22.450> right<00:02:22.630> here<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.330> little<00:02:25.360> more

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
difference right here it's a little more

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.070 
difference right here it's a little more
I<00:02:26.530> want<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> say<00:02:27.580> protection<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.750> heel

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
I want to say protection on the heel

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.060 
I want to say protection on the heel
also<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:29.710> here<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:31.300> much<00:02:31.630> tougher<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.890> this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
also right here is much tougher on this

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.940 
also right here is much tougher on this
nano3<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.060> don't<00:02:34.930> really<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.350> why<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> need

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
nano3 I don't really know why you need

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.310 
nano3 I don't really know why you need
these<00:02:36.130> protections<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.780> don't<00:02:38.230> do

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
these protections because I don't do

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.080 
these protections because I don't do
anything<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.800> get<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> top<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.550> my<00:02:39.670> feet<00:02:39.880> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
anything to get on the top of my feet I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.870 
anything to get on the top of my feet I
mean<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.510> you're<00:02:40.960> gonna<00:02:41.080> drop<00:02:41.320> something<00:02:41.880> this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
mean if you're gonna drop something this

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.430 
mean if you're gonna drop something this
is<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.390> protect<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.900> as<00:02:44.020> much<00:02:44.230> as

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
is not going to protect you as much as

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.000 
is not going to protect you as much as
you<00:02:44.770> know<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.180> mean<00:02:46.180> not<00:02:47.170> necessarily<00:02:47.350> any

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
you know I mean not necessarily any

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.820 
you know I mean not necessarily any
better<00:02:48.100> than<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.840> one<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.380> don't<00:02:50.710> know

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
better than this one but I don't know

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.460 
better than this one but I don't know
why<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.040> would<00:02:51.340> want<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.700> cage<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.200> can

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
why you would want this cage all I can

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.870 
why you would want this cage all I can
think<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:53.950> you're<00:02:54.100> doing<00:02:54.340> double<00:02:54.610> unders

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
think of if you're doing double unders

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.850 
think of if you're doing double unders
are<00:02:55.030> hitting<00:02:55.330> yourself<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.650> may

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
are hitting yourself over here this may

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.610 
are hitting yourself over here this may
give<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> little<00:02:57.460> more<00:02:57.610> protection<00:02:58.620> that's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
give you a little more protection that's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.350 
give you a little more protection that's
the<00:02:59.800> only<00:02:59.980> thing<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.760> as<00:03:01.060> far<00:03:01.120> as

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
the only thing I can think of as far as

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.460 
the only thing I can think of as far as
the<00:03:01.510> bottoms<00:03:01.930> go

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the bottoms go

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.850 
the bottoms go
let's<00:03:03.460> compare<00:03:03.850> men<00:03:04.120> men<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.470> thickness

let's compare men men the thickness

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.760 
let's compare men men the thickness
seems<00:03:06.100> about<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.550> same<00:03:07.590> obviously<00:03:08.590> I've<00:03:08.740> been

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
seems about the same obviously I've been

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.850 
seems about the same obviously I've been
bruising<00:03:09.250> mine<00:03:09.430> as<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.760> said<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:11.320> heel<00:03:11.620> has

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
bruising mine as I said but the heel has

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.470 
bruising mine as I said but the heel has
this<00:03:12.040> extra<00:03:13.560> black<00:03:14.560> area<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.730> sole<00:03:16.239> at

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
the bottom as you can see I'm wearing

the bottom as you can see I'm wearing
out<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> little<00:03:20.110> bit<00:03:20.290> over<00:03:20.470> here<00:03:20.620> too<00:03:20.860> but<00:03:21.209> the

out a little bit over here too but the
heel<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> little<00:03:25.140> blended<00:03:26.140> into<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.790> foam

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
as the rope tech inside you still have

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.270

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the rope climbing this part really grips

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.009 
the rope climbing this part really grips
really<00:03:42.820> nicely<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.239> nanotubes

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
really nicely on nanotubes

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.170 
really nicely on nanotubes
I<00:03:44.050> have<00:03:44.650> no<00:03:44.800> problem<00:03:45.220> with<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.370> they<00:03:45.640> said<00:03:45.910> this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
I have no problem with it they said this

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.790 
I have no problem with it they said this
one<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.480> improved<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.140> haven't<00:03:47.440> tried<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.650> yet

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
one is improved I haven't tried it yet

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.190 
one is improved I haven't tried it yet
but<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.370> only<00:03:48.489> thing<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:49.030> tell<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.420> you'll

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
but the only thing I can tell is you'll

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.460 
but the only thing I can tell is you'll
get<00:03:50.440> more<00:03:50.650> support<00:03:51.100> right<00:03:51.370> here<00:03:52.230> than<00:03:53.230> this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
get more support right here than this

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.890 
get more support right here than this
one<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:54.370> you're<00:03:54.610> like<00:03:54.910> hitting<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> rope

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
one if you're like hitting with the rope

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.110 
one if you're like hitting with the rope
so<00:03:56.680> there's<00:03:57.040> more<00:03:57.310> protection<00:03:57.820> on<00:03:57.910> rope

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
so there's more protection on rope

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.780 
so there's more protection on rope
climbing<00:03:58.480> for<00:03:58.780> Meno<00:03:59.019> threes<00:03:59.350> as<00:04:00.250> far<00:04:00.580> as<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
climbing for Meno threes as far as the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.120 
climbing for Meno threes as far as the
fitting<00:04:01.090> goes<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.630> have<00:04:02.410> no<00:04:02.560> problem<00:04:03.040> with

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
fitting goes I have no problem with

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.310 
fitting goes I have no problem with
nanotubes<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.180> you're<00:04:04.450> not<00:04:04.600> gonna<00:04:04.750> feel<00:04:05.050> much

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
nanotubes so you're not gonna feel much

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320 
nanotubes so you're not gonna feel much
of<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.560> difference<00:04:05.980> with<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> Nano<00:04:06.489> 3<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:07.090> far

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
of a difference with the Nano 3 as far

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.600 
of a difference with the Nano 3 as far
as<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.570> feeling<00:04:07.870> goes<00:04:08.050> so<00:04:08.350> if<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.739> size<00:04:09.040> will

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
as the feeling goes so if the size will

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.759 
as the feeling goes so if the size will
be<00:04:09.790> fit<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> same<00:04:10.390> way<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:11.110> shoe<00:04:11.320> will<00:04:11.560> grab

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
be fit the same way the shoe will grab

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.800 
be fit the same way the shoe will grab
the<00:04:11.950> same<00:04:12.130> way<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.910> only<00:04:13.060> thing<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.660> power

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
the same way the only thing is the power

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.690 
the same way the only thing is the power
formats<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.350> improvement<00:04:14.830> just<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.250> tiny<00:04:15.459> bit

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
formats the improvement just a tiny bit

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.879 
formats the improvement just a tiny bit
but<00:04:15.910> overall<00:04:16.780> fitting<00:04:17.290> actually

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
but overall fitting actually

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.800 
but overall fitting actually
maybe<00:04:19.669> I'll<00:04:19.879> be<00:04:20.030> wearing<00:04:20.269> them<00:04:20.509> a<00:04:20.539> long<00:04:20.780> time

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
maybe I'll be wearing them a long time

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.200 
maybe I'll be wearing them a long time
you<00:04:21.470> know<00:04:21.739> got<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> shape<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.639> my<00:04:22.940> feet<00:04:23.180> a

you know got the shape of my feet a

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.850 
you know got the shape of my feet a
little<00:04:23.389> bit<00:04:23.539> so<00:04:23.870> I'm<00:04:23.990> more<00:04:24.229> comfortable<00:04:24.470> with

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
little bit so I'm more comfortable with

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.820 
little bit so I'm more comfortable with
Nana<00:04:25.310> Tuesday<00:04:25.849> nano<00:04:26.539> threes<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.560> I'm<00:04:27.710> not

Nana Tuesday nano threes but I'm not

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.790 
Nana Tuesday nano threes but I'm not
ignoring<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.520> improvements<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.539> shoe

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
ignoring the improvements on the shoe

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.990 
ignoring the improvements on the shoe
obviously<00:04:30.800> if<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:30.979> worry<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.340> little<00:04:31.639> bit<00:04:31.819> and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
obviously if I worry a little bit and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.189 
obviously if I worry a little bit and
get<00:04:32.330> my<00:04:32.479> feet<00:04:32.750> used<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.199> it<00:04:33.319> I'll<00:04:33.500> probably<00:04:33.800> be

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
get my feet used to it I'll probably be

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.990 
get my feet used to it I'll probably be

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
anything else I'm just doing this as a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.540 
anything else I'm just doing this as a
crossfitter<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.949> is<00:04:46.099> what<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.340> looks

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
crossfitter so this is what it looks

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.129 
crossfitter so this is what it looks
like<00:04:46.729> it<00:04:46.909> different<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:49.750> they're<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.960> same

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
like it different it they're the same

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.700 
like it different it they're the same
actually<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.219> one<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.580> little<00:04:52.789> thicker

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
actually this one is a little thicker

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.670 
actually this one is a little thicker
this<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.860> more<00:04:55.099> of<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.400> thinner<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:57.409> get

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
this is more of a thinner so you get

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.249 
this is more of a thinner so you get
more<00:04:57.919> cushion<00:04:58.580> with<00:04:58.729> this<00:04:58.909> one<00:04:59.150> but<00:04:59.360> um<00:04:59.659> I'm

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
more cushion with this one but um I'm

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.110 
more cushion with this one but um I'm
sure<00:05:00.319> the<00:05:00.830> tightness<00:05:01.069> would<00:05:01.430> be<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.669> same<00:05:01.909> way

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
sure the tightness would be the same way

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.240 
sure the tightness would be the same way
you<00:05:02.180> hold<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.900> laces<00:05:03.259> one<00:05:03.560> thing<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:03.860> realized

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
you hold the laces one thing I realized

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.399 
you hold the laces one thing I realized
that<00:05:04.460> shoe<00:05:05.180> laces<00:05:05.389> are<00:05:05.629> really<00:05:05.900> long<00:05:06.080> on<00:05:06.259> this

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
that shoe laces are really long on this

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.480 
that shoe laces are really long on this
one<00:05:07.150> nano<00:05:08.150> 3<00:05:08.449> has<00:05:08.629> really<00:05:08.960> long<00:05:09.139> laces<00:05:09.490> once

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
one nano 3 has really long laces once

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.290 
one nano 3 has really long laces once
you<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:10.940> know<00:05:10.969> tie<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.810> all<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.139> way<00:05:12.229> up<00:05:13.300> these

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
you you know tie it all the way up these

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.480 
you you know tie it all the way up these
dangle<00:05:14.719> a<00:05:14.810> lot<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.289> you<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:15.949> to<00:05:16.099> find<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.370> way

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
dangle a lot so you have to find a way

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.570 
dangle a lot so you have to find a way
to<00:05:16.520> put<00:05:16.819> them<00:05:16.969> in<00:05:17.090> somewhere<00:05:18.099> other<00:05:19.099> than<00:05:19.250> that

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
to put them in somewhere other than that

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.999 
to put them in somewhere other than that
and<00:05:20.479> they're<00:05:20.629> all<00:05:20.810> great<00:05:21.110> shoes

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
and they're all great shoes

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.059 
and they're all great shoes
this<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.699> woman's<00:05:23.060> as<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.360> said<00:05:23.860> one<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:24.979> the

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
this is woman's as I said one of the

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.659 
this is woman's as I said one of the
nicest<00:05:25.400> colors<00:05:27.039> you<00:05:28.039> can<00:05:28.219> see<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.460> grip

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
nicest colors you can see the grip

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.070 
nicest colors you can see the grip
difference<00:05:29.090> between<00:05:31.539> right<00:05:32.539> here<00:05:32.719> with

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
difference between right here with

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.839 
difference between right here with
nanotubes<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.979> then<00:05:34.759> o3<00:05:36.490> warmest<00:05:37.490> shoe<00:05:37.699> the

yellow<00:05:38.120> one<00:05:38.389> is<00:05:38.569> a<00:05:38.599> little<00:05:39.020> narrower

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
yellow one is a little narrower

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.790 
yellow one is a little narrower
obviously<00:05:40.099> the<00:05:40.219> because<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.849> the<00:05:40.940> fit<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.150> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
obviously the because of the fit of the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.450 
obviously the because of the fit of the
shoe<00:05:42.800> for<00:05:43.219> womens<00:05:43.580> but<00:05:43.940> other<00:05:44.900> than<00:05:45.139> that

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
shoe for womens but other than that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.580

there<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.490> no<00:05:46.729> difference<00:05:47.180> between<00:05:47.590> Manzano

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
there is no difference between Manzano

just<00:06:15.590> the<00:06:15.710> heel<00:06:15.979> blends<00:06:16.310> in<00:06:16.490> a<00:06:16.580> little<00:06:16.610> more<00:06:17.029> on

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
just the heel blends in a little more on

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.820 
just the heel blends in a little more on
this<00:06:17.360> one<00:06:17.539> also<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:17.990> woman's<00:06:18.349> it's<00:06:18.529> the<00:06:18.650> same

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
this one also the woman's it's the same

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.300 
this one also the woman's it's the same
way<00:06:19.120> so<00:06:20.120> these<00:06:21.080> are<00:06:21.289> the<00:06:21.379> shoes<00:06:22.029> Nano<00:06:23.029> 3<00:06:23.599> nano<00:06:23.990> 2

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
way so these are the shoes Nano 3 nano 2

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.999 
way so these are the shoes Nano 3 nano 2
and<00:06:25.310> another<00:06:25.819> nano<00:06:26.270> 3<00:06:26.539> for<00:06:26.779> men's<00:06:27.009> woman's

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
and another nano 3 for men's woman's

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.790 
and another nano 3 for men's woman's
men's<00:06:28.399> men's

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
men's men's

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.290 
men's men's
so<00:06:30.780> as<00:06:31.780> far<00:06:32.050> as<00:06:32.110> my<00:06:32.409> vote<00:06:32.650> goes<00:06:33.090> if<00:06:34.090> you're

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
so as far as my vote goes if you're

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.809 
so as far as my vote goes if you're
gonna<00:06:34.419> buy<00:06:34.690> one<00:06:34.960> if<00:06:35.169> nano2<00:06:35.740> is<00:06:35.860> cheaper<00:06:36.250> go<00:06:36.550> for

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
gonna buy one if nano2 is cheaper go for

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.510 
gonna buy one if nano2 is cheaper go for
it<00:06:36.940> you're<00:06:37.720> not<00:06:37.870> gonna<00:06:38.020> miss<00:06:38.770> anything<00:06:39.069> you're

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
it you're not gonna miss anything you're

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.700 
it you're not gonna miss anything you're
not<00:06:39.699> gonna<00:06:39.879> miss<00:06:40.120> nothing<00:06:40.539> actually<00:06:40.710> they'll

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
not gonna miss nothing actually they'll

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.800 
not gonna miss nothing actually they'll
do<00:06:41.919> just<00:06:42.159> fine<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:42.639> they<00:06:43.030> may<00:06:43.210> even<00:06:43.240> fit<00:06:43.780> a

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
do just fine and they may even fit a

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.170 
do just fine and they may even fit a
little<00:06:44.199> better<00:06:44.440> because<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:44.860> see<00:06:45.250> my<00:06:45.729> feet<00:06:46.000> is<00:06:46.150> a

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
little better because I see my feet is a

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.570 
little better because I see my feet is a
little<00:06:46.539> larger<00:06:47.050> than<00:06:47.080> medium<00:06:47.560> so<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.250> love

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
little larger than medium so I love

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.430 
little larger than medium so I love
these<00:06:48.759> the<00:06:49.750> way<00:06:49.900> they<00:06:50.050> fit<00:06:50.319> of<00:06:50.470> mine<00:06:50.710> I<00:06:52.440> don't

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
these the way they fit of mine I don't

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.749 
these the way they fit of mine I don't
think<00:06:53.710> you<00:06:53.770> gotta<00:06:53.949> do<00:06:54.099> wrong<00:06:54.280> if<00:06:54.460> you<00:06:54.550> have<00:06:54.669> the

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
think you gotta do wrong if you have the

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.540 
think you gotta do wrong if you have the
budget<00:06:54.879> but<00:06:55.330> if<00:06:56.289> you're<00:06:56.530> gonna<00:06:56.650> pick<00:06:57.039> one<00:06:57.069> and

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
budget but if you're gonna pick one and

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.760 
budget but if you're gonna pick one and
if<00:06:57.639> you<00:06:57.819> have<00:06:57.940> shorter<00:06:58.270> money<00:06:58.509> or<00:06:58.840> trying<00:06:59.710> to

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
if you have shorter money or trying to

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.680 
if you have shorter money or trying to
decide<00:07:00.069> what<00:07:00.220> to<00:07:00.400> do<00:07:00.520> go<00:07:00.879> for<00:07:01.090> nano<00:07:01.270> -<00:07:01.479> you

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
decide what to do go for nano - you

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.589 
decide what to do go for nano - you
won't<00:07:01.870> regret<00:07:01.960> it<00:07:02.259> and<00:07:03.180> if<00:07:04.180> you're<00:07:04.389> spending

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 
won't regret it and if you're spending

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.930 
won't regret it and if you're spending
one<00:07:05.020> thing<00:07:05.229> I<00:07:05.379> always<00:07:05.560> say<00:07:05.650> for<00:07:06.099> CrossFit<00:07:06.699> if

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
one thing I always say for CrossFit if

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.719 
one thing I always say for CrossFit if
you<00:07:07.120> have<00:07:07.240> just<00:07:07.449> you<00:07:07.830> know<00:07:08.830> no<00:07:09.069> money<00:07:09.280> but<00:07:09.490> just

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
you have just you know no money but just

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.189 
you have just you know no money but just
spend<00:07:09.969> on<00:07:10.120> one<00:07:10.270> thing<00:07:10.479> definitely<00:07:10.780> buy<00:07:11.169> this

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
spend on one thing definitely buy this

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.589 
spend on one thing definitely buy this
 makes<00:07:11.740> a<00:07:11.830> huge<00:07:12.099> difference<00:07:12.330> by<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.389> way

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 
 makes a huge difference by the way

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.950 
 makes a huge difference by the way
the<00:07:13.750> weight<00:07:13.930> of<00:07:14.639> these<00:07:15.639> two<00:07:15.909> they're<00:07:16.539> both<00:07:16.750> 9

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
the weight of these two they're both 9

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.619 
the weight of these two they're both 9
and<00:07:16.990> a<00:07:17.169> half's<00:07:18.240> Nano<00:07:19.240> 3<00:07:19.569> is<00:07:19.780> a<00:07:19.810> little<00:07:20.289> heavier

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:21.629 
and a half's Nano 3 is a little heavier

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:24.029 
and a half's Nano 3 is a little heavier
feeling<00:07:22.629> so<00:07:23.050> I'm<00:07:23.169> just<00:07:23.409> thinking<00:07:23.830> there's

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
feeling so I'm just thinking there's

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.040 
feeling so I'm just thinking there's
just<00:07:24.370> like<00:07:24.639> this<00:07:24.849> tiny<00:07:25.120> difference<00:07:25.659> between

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
just like this tiny difference between

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.850 
just like this tiny difference between
them<00:07:26.259> but<00:07:26.550> you<00:07:27.550> won't<00:07:27.759> feel<00:07:27.940> it<00:07:28.090> probably

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
them but you won't feel it probably

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.260 
them but you won't feel it probably
jumping<00:07:29.860> up<00:07:29.949> and<00:07:30.039> down<00:07:30.159> doing<00:07:30.520> box<00:07:30.819> jumps<00:07:30.940> and

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
jumping up and down doing box jumps and

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.290 
jumping up and down doing box jumps and
all<00:07:31.360> that<00:07:31.539> but<00:07:31.770> it<00:07:32.770> seems<00:07:32.979> like<00:07:33.300> nanotubes

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
all that but it seems like nanotubes

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.680 
all that but it seems like nanotubes
feels<00:07:34.539> a<00:07:34.690> little<00:07:34.840> lighter<00:07:35.310> so<00:07:36.539> that's<00:07:37.539> about

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
feels a little lighter so that's about

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.800 
feels a little lighter so that's about
it<00:07:37.840> let<00:07:38.740> me<00:07:38.830> know<00:07:38.949> what<00:07:39.099> you<00:07:39.219> think<00:07:39.599> thanks<00:07:40.599> for

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
it let me know what you think thanks for

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.110 
it let me know what you think thanks for
watching
