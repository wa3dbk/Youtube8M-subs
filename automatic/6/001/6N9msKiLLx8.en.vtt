00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
bit of math I know what's going to be

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180 
bit of math I know what's going to be
expensive<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.520> knew<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:46.039> let's<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.129> ahead

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and do a little bit of math okay so wave

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
and do a little bit of math okay so wave
1<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> rough<00:00:50.879> estimate<00:00:51.420> I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.580 
to talk about the starter pack eighty
dollars<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.890> 203<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.060> wave<00:01:45.329> 1<00:01:45.630> plus<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> starter

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
dollars so 203 for wave 1 plus a starter

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.550 
dollars so 203 for wave 1 plus a starter
pack<00:01:46.799> plus<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> wave<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> seventy<00:01:48.119> dollars
