00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello everyone then for this tutorial 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.720
 I will explain to you how to make a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.609
 automated ice with pistons yes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 since what I tell with a map 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:36.690
 who is called who comes alone as 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.170
 this hop and a restart then there it is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.489
 the furnished version 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.489
 yes so that's it and it's done well 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:52.949
 then we will go to the version 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:55.770
 boned so the inside the system so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.280
 Here we put a map that stopped by 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 one by one ride 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.380
 I could live that's it then we 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.080
 active in toxic sludge activates the rail 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 so the same quarter of the 100 it takes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 ten times he continues his way up 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.030
 seraglio where he stops we press a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.840
 button and go back then we made a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.020
 little demo the piston he has pushed 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 words 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:50.270
 here and that's not something 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.340
 complicated could end up for 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 the following 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 back world so we end up for 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.759
 the realization of the system 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.390
 so we will start by doing a 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:09.080
 stairs four steps at clackers 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.250
 then we put normal rails and then 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.739
 a rail booster a rail booster for 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.170
 stop the masne cards alongside the 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:25.989
 circuit a little bit safe then we 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.600
 connects the rail booster with restaurants 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:35.300
 we go from below 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:47.200
 Braille from below the rails but 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:55.850
 henry peter hall at landstuhl tak tak 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:03:01.650
 that we connect to a button we are a 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.000
 graphical sheep it works 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.769
 really it is true that europe is at 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.680
 background the repeater never put them in 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.610
 the common sense that we verify that it 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.909
 walk is good then we put the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:27.659
 pistons 1 the piston a thin it moans 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:29.959
 in my essence see clients that yes 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.959
 right here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:43.889
 there we are at the button it works we place 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.260
 the piston here to shift the match will be 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:53.099
 the same map or have created a circuit 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:58.290
 offset parallel just had just one block 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:01.370
 or collect the piston or circuit at 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.370
 rail circuit 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.370
 we put two repeaters we are 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.310
 then 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.109
 bahmani hop we see that it works well 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.419
 now we will try we will see 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.549
 will do with the right cards asked 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.870
 mccarthy the balls stopped by the rail 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.120
 booster it activates the button it goes down 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:33.930
 is pushed by the piston and that's 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.780
 good yes me as I said then I 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.180
 prefer to put a piston since 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.630
 franÃ§ois bonneau then for 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.669
 stopping a card and without restarting 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.289
 but two rails booster or parra for 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.870
 stop the bath of cards that connects 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.820
 to reconnect at the latest from here we 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.680
 know all continents plus circuit on 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.580
 quote have reconnected rails and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.580
 button restaurants 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:28.360
 take up between mireille finally no no no 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.380
 there was no need of even 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.060
 need to connect an offside just the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:43.900
 put here it's even better we'll put 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:47.530
 a button and start doing better so 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.560
 it's good the rails are activated on my 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.110
 mind card that stops always stopped 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.440
 we activate 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.080
 they arrive they stop well 1st 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.340
 move do not put the boosters 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.169
 must put the blood story in 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.060
 their beautiful form is rare is normal 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:11.919
 to know map stops in 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:14.620
 downhill see do the manipulation on 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.310
 send it the same card is certainly fine 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.320
 going down and and going away so here is 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.199
 thank you for following this tutorial I hope 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.840
 that he will have served you 1 despite all these 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:30.370
 little boondoggles 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.710
 here we are, I hope you'll arrive 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.770
 well to reproduce this system that you 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.900
 will serve thanks for following this title 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.460
 go to the end 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.930
 do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.930
