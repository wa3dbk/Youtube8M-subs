really the spirit of what I've tried to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.700 
really the spirit of what I've tried to
do<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:17.420> about<00:00:18.420> five<00:00:18.779> years<00:00:19.109> ago<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.680> were

do here about five years ago we were

pool<00:00:22.800> heater<00:00:23.130> which<00:00:23.369> turned<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
pool heater which turned out to be a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
pool heater which turned out to be a
fairly<00:00:24.330> expensive<00:00:24.810> proposition<00:00:25.460> several

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460

thousands<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> dollars<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> point<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
thousands of dollars and at that point I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
thousands of dollars and at that point I
started<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> wonder<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.380> possibility

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
started to wonder about the possibility

of<00:00:32.130> providing<00:00:32.640> solar<00:00:33.320> was<00:00:34.320> something<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of providing solar was something that I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.060 
of providing solar was something that I
would<00:00:35.100> build<00:00:35.420> after<00:00:36.420> five<00:00:36.690> years<00:00:37.070> five

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
would build after five years five

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.380 
would build after five years five
prototypes<00:00:38.879> much<00:00:39.860> distress<00:00:40.860> agony<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.850> some

prototypes much distress agony and some
delightful<00:00:42.660> times<00:00:43.230> I've<00:00:43.559> come<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.160> with

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
delightful times I've come up with

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
delightful times I've come up with
something<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.850> I'd<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> share<00:00:45.629> with
