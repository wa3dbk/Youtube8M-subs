so unlike Gran Turismo you don't really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.160 
so unlike Gran Turismo you don't really
have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.829> keep<00:01:38.159> racing<00:01:38.460> races<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.450> earn<00:01:39.869> income

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
have to keep racing races to earn income

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.380

to<00:01:40.710> buy<00:01:40.890> new<00:01:41.159> vehicles<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to buy new vehicles here you just

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.210 
to buy new vehicles here you just
complete<00:01:42.780> challenges<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.530> complete<00:01:43.979> race

events and you get new bikes but also

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
events and you get new bikes but also
since<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:46.950> money<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.729> don't<00:01:47.939> really

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
since there is no money you don't really

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
four people so you can only have four

AI<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.290> also<00:02:44.860> pretty<00:02:45.640> mechanical<00:02:46.030> they<00:02:46.870> just

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
AI is also pretty mechanical they just

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.140 
AI is also pretty mechanical they just
basically<00:02:47.320> ride<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.490> same<00:02:48.730> straight<00:02:49.120> line

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
basically ride the same straight line

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.510 
basically ride the same straight line
through<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> course<00:02:50.080> each<00:02:50.320> time<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.280> only

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
through the course each time the only

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.250 
through the course each time the only
fault<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:52.030> being<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.600> they<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:53.080> a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
fault really being that they get a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.900 
fault really being that they get a
little<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.620> too<00:02:53.800> conservative<00:02:54.040> sometimes

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
little bit too conservative sometimes

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.940 
little bit too conservative sometimes
and<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.720> take<00:02:55.960> corners<00:02:56.350> slower<00:02:56.710> than

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
and you know take corners slower than

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.130 
and you know take corners slower than
they<00:02:57.100> really<00:02:57.400> need<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.690> doesn't<00:02:59.020> really

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
they really need to so it doesn't really

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.590 
they really need to so it doesn't really
it<00:02:59.470> almost<00:02:59.770> feels<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.250> each<00:03:00.700> race<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.270> more

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
it almost feels like each race is more

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.020 
it almost feels like each race is more
of<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.780> Time<00:03:02.110> Trial<00:03:02.470> than<00:03:03.100> an<00:03:03.250> actual<00:03:03.550> heated

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
of a Time Trial than an actual heated

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
race to the finish line you don't really

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.860 
race to the finish line you don't really
feel<00:03:06.100> like<00:03:06.160> there's<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.610> very<00:03:07.240> stiff

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
feel like there's a very stiff

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.830 
feel like there's a very stiff
competition<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:09.310> also<00:03:09.460> at<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.760> same<00:03:09.910> time<00:03:10.180> if
