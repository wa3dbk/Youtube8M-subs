ghosts<00:01:31.710> almost<00:01:32.310> completely<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.360> ghost<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
ghosts almost completely so ghost is the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.700 
ghosts almost completely so ghost is the
equivalent<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.890> cold-blooded<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:36.710> UAV

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
equivalent of like cold-blooded or UAV

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.460 
equivalent of like cold-blooded or UAV
jammer<00:01:38.040> from<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> previous<00:01:39.000> games<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
jammer from the previous games but it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.060 
jammer from the previous games but it
has<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> better<00:01:42.170> use<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.530> cold<00:01:43.979> do

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
has you know a better use in cold do

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
has you know a better use in cold do
black<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.520> something<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.540> gonna<00:01:45.630> make

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
black out something that is gonna make

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.950 
black out something that is gonna make
it<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.490> necessary<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.780> much

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it you know much more necessary or much

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
it you know much more necessary or much
more<00:01:49.110> needed<00:01:49.439> perk<00:01:49.680> than<00:01:50.159> UAV<00:01:50.670> jammer<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.180> cold

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
more needed perk than UAV jammer or cold

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
more needed perk than UAV jammer or cold

is now introduced into the game so I'm
going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.209> making<00:02:12.599> different<00:02:13.230> videos

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
going to be making different videos

things that are being introduced in
black<00:02:16.560> ops<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.129> are<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.760> change<00:02:18.239> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
black ops that are going to change a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.150 
black ops that are going to change a
really<00:02:18.780> big<00:02:18.900> part<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> game<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:20.099> is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
really big part of the game and this is

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
really big part of the game and this is
definitely<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.330> Blackbird<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260

the legitimate gameplays that were

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.280 
the legitimate gameplays that were
released<00:02:31.170> after<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.810> multiplayer<00:02:33.810> event

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290

beta none of those shenanigans so anyway
the<00:02:42.599> Blackbird<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.170> basically<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.980> super

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the Blackbird is basically like a super

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.569 
the Blackbird is basically like a super
UAV<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.049> basically<00:02:46.049> what<00:02:46.260> does<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.549> a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
UAV and basically what does is for a

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.490 
UAV and basically what does is for a
full<00:02:47.790> minute<00:02:48.000> without<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> refresh<00:02:49.110> rate<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
full minute without a refresh rate it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.170 
full minute without a refresh rate it
shows<00:02:49.890> where<00:02:50.220> everybody<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> enemy<00:02:51.150> team

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
shows where everybody on the enemy team

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.440 
shows where everybody on the enemy team
without<00:02:51.900> ghost<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.489> also<00:02:53.640> shows<00:02:53.970> their

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
without ghost is and it also shows their

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
without ghost is and it also shows their
arrow<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.959> doesn't<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.380> show<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> red<00:02:55.799> dot<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
arrow it doesn't just show a red dot it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.640 
arrow it doesn't just show a red dot it
shows<00:02:56.430> their<00:02:56.700> red<00:02:57.450> arrow<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.590> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
shows their red arrow so that's going to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.809 
shows their red arrow so that's going to
show<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.069> direction<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.640> they're

and it's an eighth kill streak by the
way<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.010> Blackbird<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.299> fairly

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
way the Blackbird so it is fairly

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.360 
way the Blackbird so it is fairly
difficult<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.440> now<00:03:13.680> remember<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.280> know

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
difficult to get now remember you know

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.500 
difficult to get now remember you know
that's<00:03:14.549> eight<00:03:14.760> kills<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.299> get<00:03:15.420> with

that's eight kills you have to get with

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.449 
that's eight kills you have to get with
your<00:03:15.569> gun<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.260> not<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.129> eight

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
your gun that is not you know eight

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.520 
your gun that is not you know eight
kills<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.269> get<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.170> know<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
kills that you can get you know get a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.319 
kills that you can get you know get a
predator<00:03:20.190> than<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.519> earlier<00:03:20.819> then<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.239> know

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
predator than that earlier then you know

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.970 
predator than that earlier then you know
that<00:03:21.660> way<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> all<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.410> course<00:03:22.440> predator

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that way and all that of course predator

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620 
that way and all that of course predator
and<00:03:23.069> harrier<00:03:23.310> aren't<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.730> next<00:03:23.940> game<00:03:24.150> but

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
and harrier aren't in the next game but

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.090 
and harrier aren't in the next game but
you<00:03:24.720> guys<00:03:24.840> understand<00:03:25.410> what<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:25.590> saying<00:03:25.829> kill

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
you guys understand what I'm saying kill

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.620 
you guys understand what I'm saying kill
streaks<00:03:26.310> don't<00:03:26.459> stack<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.850> each<00:03:26.880> other<00:03:27.150> so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
streaks don't stack on each other so

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.670 
streaks don't stack on each other so
it's<00:03:27.750> gonna<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.989> kind<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.200> difficult<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.560> get

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it's gonna be kind of difficult to get

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.039 
it's gonna be kind of difficult to get
that<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.100> ghost<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.030> going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.299> be<00:03:30.420> much<00:03:30.810> more

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that so ghost is going to be much more

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.990 
that so ghost is going to be much more
useful<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> perk<00:03:31.829> than<00:03:32.280> cold<00:03:32.579> blooded<00:03:32.790> or

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
useful of a perk than cold blooded or

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.300 
useful of a perk than cold blooded or
UAV<00:03:33.389> Jam<00:03:33.599> or<00:03:33.720> ever<00:03:33.870> were<00:03:34.079> because<00:03:34.680> now<00:03:34.920> it's

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
UAV Jam or ever were because now it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.729 
UAV Jam or ever were because now it's
basically<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:35.849> this<00:03:36.030> -<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.329> bee's<00:03:36.690> -<00:03:37.290> UAVs

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
basically like this - a bee's - UAVs

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.440 
basically like this - a bee's - UAVs
that<00:03:37.980> you'll<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.970> deal<00:03:39.120> with<00:03:39.269> on<00:03:39.359> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
want to bring up about ghosts

your spy plane and number two all the
enemies<00:04:37.200> who<00:04:37.440> are<00:04:37.470> depending<00:04:38.010> on<00:04:38.160> their<00:04:38.460> UAV

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
enemies who are depending on their UAV

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.540 
enemies who are depending on their UAV
or<00:04:39.030> their<00:04:39.390> spy<00:04:39.720> plane<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.920> going<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.430> be

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
or their spy plane is going to be

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.670 
or their spy plane is going to be
negated<00:04:41.910> by<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.270> using<00:04:42.960> your<00:04:43.080> counter<00:04:43.470> spy

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
negated by you using your counter spy

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.010 
negated by you using your counter spy
plane<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.130> those<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.300> definitely<00:04:45.840> some

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
plane so those are definitely some

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.970 
plane so those are definitely some
things<00:04:46.050> you're<00:04:46.320> going<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.470> want<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> keep<00:04:46.830> in

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
things you're going to want to keep in

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.880 
things you're going to want to keep in
mind<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.520> use<00:04:48.180> when<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:49.410> know<00:04:49.500> black<00:04:49.680> ops

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
mind and use when you know black ops

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.770 
mind and use when you know black ops
comes<00:04:50.100> out<00:04:50.280> that's<00:04:50.670> gonna<00:04:50.820> be<00:04:51.030> pretty

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
comes out that's gonna be pretty

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.780 
comes out that's gonna be pretty
relevant<00:04:52.260> for<00:04:52.440> at<00:04:52.530> least<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:53.070> month<00:04:53.250> I'd<00:04:53.550> say

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
relevant for at least a month I'd say

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.520 
relevant for at least a month I'd say
and<00:04:54.030> I'll<00:04:54.390> tell<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.810> guys<00:04:54.990> you're<00:04:55.200> gonna<00:04:55.260> see

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
and I'll tell you guys you're gonna see

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.650 
and I'll tell you guys you're gonna see
some<00:04:55.680> gameplay<00:04:56.100> from<00:04:56.700> me<00:04:56.880> with<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.180> UAV<00:04:57.630> and

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
some gameplay from me with the UAV and

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.150 
some gameplay from me with the UAV and
also<00:04:58.110> kill<00:04:58.440> streaks<00:04:58.650> don't<00:04:58.800> stack<00:04:58.980> on<00:04:59.130> each

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
also kill streaks don't stack on each

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.650 
also kill streaks don't stack on each
other<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.850> harder<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.210> get<00:05:00.300> those<00:05:00.480> high

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
other so it's harder to get those high

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.870 
other so it's harder to get those high
ones<00:05:00.840> UAV<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.800> gonna<00:05:01.950> be<00:05:02.040> more<00:05:02.190> prevalent<00:05:02.460> all

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
ones UAV is gonna be more prevalent all

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.460 
ones UAV is gonna be more prevalent all
the<00:05:03.060> way<00:05:03.120> throughout<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.570> game<00:05:03.780> same<00:05:04.290> thing

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the way throughout the game same thing

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.780 
the way throughout the game same thing
goes<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.830> care<00:05:05.010> package<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:05.580> I'm<00:05:05.669> gonna

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
goes to the care package but I'm gonna

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.650 
goes to the care package but I'm gonna
talk<00:05:05.970> about<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.480> different

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
talk about that in a different

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.159 
talk about that in a different
commentary<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.340> yeah<00:05:08.550> that's<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.210> one<00:05:09.930> thing

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
commentary so yeah that's the one thing

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.210 
commentary so yeah that's the one thing
that<00:05:10.350> everyone<00:05:10.530> want<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.770> talk<00:05:10.980> about<00:05:11.070> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
that everyone want to talk about the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.220 
that everyone want to talk about the
other<00:05:11.340> thing<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.669> wanted<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.910> talk<00:05:12.090> about<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.540> a

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
other thing I wanted to talk about is a

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.990 
other thing I wanted to talk about is a
really<00:05:13.919> cool<00:05:14.130> thing<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.490> found<00:05:14.700> out<00:05:14.880> about

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
really cool thing that I found out about

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.330 
really cool thing that I found out about
that<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.300> didn't<00:05:15.750> know<00:05:15.900> before<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:17.070> is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
that I didn't know before and that is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
that I didn't know before and that is
what<00:05:18.090> ninjas<00:05:18.720> probability<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.890> so<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:21.000> ninja

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
what ninjas probability is so the ninja

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.930 
what ninjas probability is so the ninja
perk<00:05:21.930> in<00:05:22.230> called<00:05:22.680> me<00:05:22.800> Black<00:05:22.980> Ops<00:05:23.220> is<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.760> same

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
perk in called me Black Ops is the same

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.450 
perk in called me Black Ops is the same
as<00:05:24.090> ninja<00:05:24.390> from<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.830> regular<00:05:26.220> perk

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
as ninja from or the regular perk

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.430 
as ninja from or the regular perk
without<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.910> Pro<00:05:27.120> Edition<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.080> same<00:05:28.260> as

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
without the Pro Edition is the same as

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.890 
without the Pro Edition is the same as
ninja<00:05:28.740> from<00:05:29.160> a<00:05:29.520> thing<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.300> is<00:05:30.419> actually<00:05:30.780> no

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
ninja from a thing it is actually no

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.990 
ninja from a thing it is actually no
it's<00:05:31.110> not<00:05:31.260> I'm<00:05:31.500> sorry

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
it's not I'm sorry

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.310 
it's not I'm sorry
basically<00:05:33.000> ninja<00:05:33.660> allows<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.140> walk

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
basically ninja allows you to walk

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.500 
basically ninja allows you to walk
silently<00:05:34.620> without<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.460> pro<00:05:35.669> version<00:05:36.090> so<00:05:36.450> you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
silently without the pro version so you

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.820 
silently without the pro version so you
don't<00:05:36.750> need<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> pro<00:05:37.169> version<00:05:37.200> like<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:37.710> do

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
don't need the pro version like you do

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.700 
don't need the pro version like you do
in<00:05:38.100> modern<00:05:38.430> warfare<00:05:38.610> 2<00:05:38.790> so<00:05:39.660> basically<00:05:40.110> with

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
in modern warfare 2 so basically with

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.090 
in modern warfare 2 so basically with
the<00:05:40.800> probability<00:05:41.400> when<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.120> have<00:05:43.100> ninja

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
the probability when you have ninja

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920 
the probability when you have ninja
equipped<00:05:44.520> or<00:05:44.790> when<00:05:45.030> when<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:45.660> have<00:05:45.780> this

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
equipped or when when you have this

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.960 
equipped or when when you have this
equipped<00:05:46.320> enemies<00:05:46.740> will<00:05:46.919> be<00:05:47.040> louder<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.640> it

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
equipped enemies will be louder and it

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.210 
equipped enemies will be louder and it
also<00:05:48.180> makes<00:05:48.600> you<00:05:48.750> completely<00:05:49.260> silent<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.070> that

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
also makes you completely silent so that

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.090 
also makes you completely silent so that
probability<00:05:50.820> is<00:05:51.180> basically<00:05:51.900> going<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.410> be

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
probability is basically going to be

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.180 
probability is basically going to be
sitrep<00:05:54.030> it's<00:05:54.300> going<00:05:54.600> to<00:05:54.690> be<00:05:54.810> ninja<00:05:55.440> plus

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
sitrep it's going to be ninja plus

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.180 
sitrep it's going to be ninja plus
sitrep<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:56.790> think<00:05:56.970> it's<00:05:57.090> not<00:05:57.270> as<00:05:58.010> severe<00:05:59.010> I

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
sitrep and I think it's not as severe I

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.380 
sitrep and I think it's not as severe I
guess<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.700> could<00:05:59.820> say<00:05:59.850> of<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:01.610> perk<00:06:02.610> as<00:06:02.880> or

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
guess you could say of a perk as or

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.960 
guess you could say of a perk as or
severe<00:06:03.960> as<00:06:04.169> an<00:06:04.320> ability<00:06:04.560> as<00:06:04.919> sitrep<00:06:05.729> was

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
severe as an ability as sitrep was

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.330 
severe as an ability as sitrep was
because<00:06:06.330> sitrep<00:06:06.690> made<00:06:06.870> enemies<00:06:07.169> like<00:06:07.530> or<00:06:07.919> made

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
because sitrep made enemies like or made

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.159 
because sitrep made enemies like or made
everybody<00:06:08.729> like<00:06:08.910> four<00:06:09.180> times<00:06:09.450> louder<00:06:09.750> and

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
everybody like four times louder and

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.960 
everybody like four times louder and
people<00:06:10.380> with<00:06:10.560> ninja<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:11.040> twice<00:06:11.340> as<00:06:11.550> loud<00:06:11.700> I

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
people with ninja like twice as loud I

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.360 
people with ninja like twice as loud I
think<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.479> just<00:06:12.570> makes<00:06:12.780> them<00:06:13.080> basically<00:06:14.070> the

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
think it just makes them basically the

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.190 
think it just makes them basically the
equivalent<00:06:14.610> of<00:06:14.970> dead<00:06:15.240> silence<00:06:15.720> so<00:06:15.840> called<00:06:16.080> it

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
equivalent of dead silence so called it

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.770
