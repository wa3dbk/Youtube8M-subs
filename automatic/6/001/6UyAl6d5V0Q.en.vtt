9005 z-axis installed on the projectors

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
9005 z-axis installed on the projectors
and<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.000> made<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> made<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.170> big

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and they made it made a pretty big

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.980 
and they made it made a pretty big
difference<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:08.430> far<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.910> way<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.660> looks

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
difference as far as the way it looks

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
difference as far as the way it looks
who<00:01:10.260> made<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.560> white<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.250> didn't<00:01:12.150> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
who made it white you know didn't really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
who made it white you know didn't really
make<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.410> much<00:01:13.620> brighter<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.070> night<00:01:14.220> as

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
make it that much brighter at night as

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
make it that much brighter at night as
far<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.730> could<00:01:14.790> tell<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.630> wanted<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.350> see

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
far as I could tell but I wanted to see

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
far as I could tell but I wanted to see
what<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.800> big<00:01:16.950> difference<00:01:17.160> was<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
what the big difference was on the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.640 
what the big difference was on the
reflective<00:01:18.900> housing<00:01:19.230> because<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.590> think

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
reflective housing because I think

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.910 
reflective housing because I think
that's<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.070> they're<00:01:20.190> really<00:01:20.340> meant<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.730> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
that's what they're really meant for and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.890 
that's what they're really meant for and
we're<00:01:22.920> about<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.160> find<00:01:23.430> out

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
we're about to find out

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.290 
we're about to find out
well<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:26.340> 2<00:01:26.640> installed

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
side I want to see what the difference

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.490

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
we'll see the difference between one zxe

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
we'll see the difference between one zxe
9005<00:01:40.020> versus<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> stock<00:01:41.840> stock<00:01:42.840> light<00:01:43.440> inside

and you start the truck so that way it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.740 
and you start the truck so that way it
looks<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.230> bit<00:01:55.440> brighter

later<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.439> the<00:02:21.530> drag<00:02:21.769> strip<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.049> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
later at the drag strip and see what the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740 
later at the drag strip and see what the
difference<00:02:24.439> is<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.709> this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
difference is on this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
difference is on this
I<00:02:26.780> mean<00:02:27.430> here's<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> wall<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:30.410> damn<00:02:31.370> that's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
I mean here's the wall like damn that's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.820 
I mean here's the wall like damn that's
a<00:02:32.060> pretty<00:02:32.240> big<00:02:32.420> difference<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.770> a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a pretty big difference I think that's a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.500 
a pretty big difference I think that's a
big<00:02:37.010> white<00:02:37.190> spot<00:02:37.460> versus<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.060> other<00:02:38.210> side

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
big white spot versus that other side

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.110 
big white spot versus that other side
which<00:02:38.690> has<00:02:38.840> pure<00:02:39.740> darkness<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:43.000> look<00:02:44.000> at<00:02:44.090> that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
which has pure darkness now look at that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.070 
which has pure darkness now look at that
let<00:02:44.900> me<00:02:44.990> get<00:02:45.110> down<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.500> its<00:02:45.620> level<00:02:47.120> can't

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
let me get down to its level can't

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.369 
let me get down to its level can't
even<00:02:48.290> see

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.369 

now<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.400> think<00:02:54.060> these<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.689> think<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.230> ones

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
now see I think these I think the ones

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.780 
now see I think these I think the ones
on<00:02:55.469> the<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.890> lot<00:02:56.040> brighter<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.609> can

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
on the right are a lot brighter you can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.959 
on the right are a lot brighter you can
tell<00:02:56.969> they're<00:02:57.209> white<00:02:58.129> they<00:02:59.129> really<00:02:59.459> do<00:02:59.639> I<00:02:59.670> mean

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
tell they're white they really do I mean

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.399 
tell they're white they really do I mean
they<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.239> fool<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.659> guess<00:03:00.989> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.349> don't

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
they can fool you I guess if you don't

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.209 
they can fool you I guess if you don't
know<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.859> HIDs<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:03.709> mean<00:03:04.709> these<00:03:04.859> are<00:03:05.010> pretty

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
know about HIDs I mean these are pretty

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.970 
know about HIDs I mean these are pretty
much<00:03:05.840> 5300<00:03:06.840> K<00:03:07.549> hid<00:03:08.549> look<00:03:09.439> for<00:03:10.439> like<00:03:10.590> half<00:03:10.829> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
much 5300 K hid look for like half the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.759 
much 5300 K hid look for like half the
price<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.019> think<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.349> might<00:03:13.469> be<00:03:13.530> more

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
price and I think there might be more

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.610 
price and I think there might be more
reliable<00:03:14.099> than<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.430> HIDs<00:03:14.969> actually<00:03:15.389> are<00:03:15.620> just

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
reliable than the HIDs actually are just

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.759 
reliable than the HIDs actually are just
shut<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:16.889> off<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.280> see<00:03:17.400> when<00:03:17.639> it<00:03:17.730> happens<00:03:18.030> I

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:47.990 

guess<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> better<00:03:23.010> turn<00:03:23.189> the<00:03:23.280> lights<00:03:23.459> back<00:03:23.519> on

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.450 

well<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.600> do<00:03:48.750> think<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.470> those<00:03:49.860> new<00:03:50.070> bulbs

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
well I do think that those new bulbs

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.640 
well I do think that those new bulbs
those<00:03:50.610> eh<00:03:50.850> geez<00:03:51.120> do<00:03:51.750> make<00:03:51.960> a<00:03:51.990> difference<00:03:52.530> you

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
those eh geez do make a difference you

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.520 
those eh geez do make a difference you
can<00:03:52.890> see<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.520> sure<00:03:54.440> especially<00:03:55.440> if

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
can see that for sure especially if

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.870 
can see that for sure especially if
you're<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.770> for<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.040> white<00:03:56.280> look<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.790> your

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
you're going for a white look on your

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.950 
you're going for a white look on your
vehicle<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:58.170> know<00:03:58.290> white<00:03:58.560> light<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.880> uh<00:03:59.960> does

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
vehicle you know white light it uh does

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.980 
vehicle you know white light it uh does
make<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:02.760> does<00:04:02.970> make<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> difference<00:04:03.270> as<00:04:03.780> far<00:04:03.810> as

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
make it does make a difference as far as

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.080 
make it does make a difference as far as
appearance<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.710> I<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.520> see<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> wallet

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
appearance and I can see on the wallet

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.580 
appearance and I can see on the wallet
was<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.330> lot<00:04:06.540> brighter<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.230> could<00:04:07.380> tell

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
was a lot brighter and you could tell

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.490 
was a lot brighter and you could tell
for<00:04:08.160> sure<00:04:08.360> had<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> big<00:04:09.600> white<00:04:09.810> spot<00:04:10.110> on<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.380> and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
for sure had a big white spot on it and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.990 
for sure had a big white spot on it and
compared<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.070> other<00:04:11.250> side<00:04:11.520> which<00:04:11.640> was<00:04:11.790> dim

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
compared to the other side which was dim

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.660 
compared to the other side which was dim
and<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.840> still<00:04:13.080> did<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.560> 9005<00:04:14.250> installed

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and I still did have the 9005 installed

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.810 
and I still did have the 9005 installed
on<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.450> passenger<00:04:16.049> side<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.820> CXC

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
on that on that passenger side the CXC

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.110 
on that on that passenger side the CXC
passenger<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.859> did<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.730> regular

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
passenger but I did have the regular

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.030 
passenger but I did have the regular
housing<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.720> mean<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.230> regular<00:04:22.380> light<00:04:22.890> bulb

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
housing I mean the regular light bulb

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.430 
housing I mean the regular light bulb
inside<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.630> reflective<00:04:24.630> housing<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:27.020> say<00:04:28.020> Byam

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
inside the reflective housing I say Byam

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.810 
inside the reflective housing I say Byam
they<00:04:28.890> look<00:04:29.100> pretty<00:04:29.280> good

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
they look pretty good

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.540 
they look pretty good
the<00:04:30.810> only<00:04:30.990> thing<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.770> only<00:04:31.920> downside<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
the only thing the only downside is the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.240 
the only thing the only downside is the
price<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.940> guess<00:04:33.180> which<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.320> mean<00:04:34.500> if<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.070> really

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
price I guess which I mean if you really

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.040 
price I guess which I mean if you really
care<00:04:35.550> about<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.540> way<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.780> looks

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
care about you know the way it looks

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.980 
care about you know the way it looks
then<00:04:37.710> no<00:04:38.070> big<00:04:38.280> deal<00:04:38.490> no<00:04:39.419> big<00:04:39.450> deal<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
then no big deal no big deal on the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.060 
then no big deal no big deal on the
price<00:04:40.169> but<00:04:40.380> here's<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> difference<00:04:40.890> in<00:04:40.980> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
price but here's the difference in the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.970 
price but here's the difference in the
bulb<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.490> way<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.700> looks<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.530> stock

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
bulb the way it looks this is stock

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.770 
bulb the way it looks this is stock
right<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.880> way<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.090> looks<00:04:45.270> at<00:04:45.419> Sylvania

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
right here the way it looks at Sylvania

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.950 
right here the way it looks at Sylvania
I<00:04:45.960> assume<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.590> mean<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.950> guess<00:04:47.160> stock<00:04:47.460> but

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
I assume I mean I guess stock but

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.840 
I assume I mean I guess stock but
Sylvania<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.020> aftermarket<00:04:49.560> but<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.610> also

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
Sylvania is aftermarket but this also

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.380 
Sylvania is aftermarket but this also
that's<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.810> new<00:04:51.990> bulb<00:04:52.880> that's<00:04:53.880> what<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.210> looks

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
that's the new bulb that's what it looks
