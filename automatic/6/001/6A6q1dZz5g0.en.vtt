00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
August it's my first global release and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.320 
August it's my first global release and
it's<00:00:36.160> already<00:00:36.489> getting<00:00:36.610> really<00:00:36.940> good<00:00:37.059> reviews

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
it's already getting really good reviews

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's already getting really good reviews
so<00:00:37.390> I'm<00:00:37.570> very<00:00:37.720> very<00:00:37.839> excited<00:00:38.379> about<00:00:38.440> it<00:00:38.769> I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
so I'm very very excited about it I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.340 
so I'm very very excited about it I
wrote<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.550> book<00:00:39.699> because<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.329> believe<00:00:40.780> that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
wrote the book because I believe that

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.100 
wrote the book because I believe that
not<00:00:41.829> every<00:00:42.220> action<00:00:42.579> or<00:00:42.940> sci-fi<00:00:43.150> story<00:00:43.690> has<00:00:43.960> to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
not every action or sci-fi story has to

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.619 
not every action or sci-fi story has to
have<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.589> straight<00:00:45.220> white<00:00:45.670> male<00:00:46.210> main

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
have a straight white male main

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.450 
have a straight white male main
character<00:00:47.199> I<00:00:47.440> think<00:00:47.470> that's<00:00:47.920> starting<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.309> get

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
character I think that's starting to get

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.610 
character I think that's starting to get
old<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.879> also<00:00:49.300> believe<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.750> teenagers<00:00:50.440> don't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
old I also believe that teenagers don't

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.960 
old I also believe that teenagers don't
need<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.860> be<00:00:50.949> talked<00:00:51.190> down<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.430> they<00:00:51.820> can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
need to be talked down to they can

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.670 
need to be talked down to they can
handle<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.480> more<00:00:52.629> sophisticated<00:00:52.809> concepts

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
handle the more sophisticated concepts

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.709 
handle the more sophisticated concepts
available<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.280> adult<00:00:54.609> science<00:00:54.940> fiction<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.510> I

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
available in adult science fiction and I

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.270 
available in adult science fiction and I
also<00:00:55.930> think<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.469> book<00:00:56.680> has<00:00:56.859> the<00:00:56.980> potential

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
also think that a book has the potential

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.130 
also think that a book has the potential
to<00:00:57.489> be<00:00:57.579> more<00:00:57.789> exciting<00:00:58.359> than<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.570> movie<00:00:58.930> or<00:00:59.109> a

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
to be more exciting than a movie or a

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.560 
to be more exciting than a movie or a
video<00:00:59.320> game<00:00:59.530> because<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.850> screen<00:01:01.180> can<00:01:01.449> only

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
video game because a screen can only

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.910 
video game because a screen can only
show<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:01.870> how<00:01:02.079> something<00:01:02.440> looks<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.800> how<00:01:02.859> it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
show you how something looks and how it

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.499 
show you how something looks and how it
sounds<00:01:03.370> but<00:01:03.430> what<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.730> leaves<00:01:03.910> out<00:01:04.149> is<00:01:04.269> how<00:01:04.420> it

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
sounds but what it leaves out is how it

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.240 
sounds but what it leaves out is how it
feels<00:01:04.750> how<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.050> smells<00:01:05.410> how<00:01:05.649> it<00:01:05.710> tastes<00:01:06.130> and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
feels how it smells how it tastes and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.370 
feels how it smells how it tastes and
you<00:01:06.789> also<00:01:06.940> end<00:01:07.270> up<00:01:07.390> budgetary<00:01:07.869> constraints

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
you also end up budgetary constraints

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.840 
you also end up budgetary constraints
