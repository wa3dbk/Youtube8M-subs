00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:12.559
 ok yes yes yes 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.800
 I came to talk with you 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.800
 because the last time was not fair 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.800
 to see us 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.850
 and I explain everything 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 well I do not want to be angry 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 and neither 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's just that we see that's why 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 if I wrote I was staying and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.930
 what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 and nothing more 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.080
 I would never have deleted 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.370
 go a question because nobody 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.950
 I limit myself to everything 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.770
 but no 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.510
 video but why live a hair 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 it's good that you came to talk with me 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.320
 because the truth is that we did not have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.980
 and those who talk to me was all 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.410
 all right 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.260
 fister leaves keeps you yesterday I went to your 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.420
 house to fix a misunderstanding all 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.710
 the mail with your dad and all this would have 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.750
 an apology ok but that does not mean 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.600
 that everything is perfect I still think that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.280
 our thing has already happened and if I had to give in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.650
 the past but if we do not do all the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 days all the time is impossible and that 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.740
 It makes me wrong it makes you bad it's not good for 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.740
 then shockey 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.160
 as well 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.210
 it's okay I understand you have to stop 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.800
 see us so much 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.240
 beyond seeing them every day 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 we have the same group of friends and it's going to 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.460
 be difficult but I'll try what you 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.460
 I promise 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.519
 action 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.780
 since there is an end to our history 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.030
 I 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.640
 I swear to you that we will not think 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.290
 swear that I tried to forget my voice and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.400
 get you out of my head but I can not 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.500
 you appear everywhere I'm alone and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.990
 I think in ways I am with my friends and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.450
 I think in voice and song and I think 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.890
 bags you are everywhere and I 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.180
 angry with myself because I do not want 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.480
 think about you all the time but not 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.100
 may l 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.420

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.420

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.120

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.379
