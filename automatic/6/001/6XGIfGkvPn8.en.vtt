now that you know how to view and select
the<00:02:43.880> object<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:45.020> begin<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.410> manipulate

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the object you can begin to manipulate

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.070 
the object you can begin to manipulate
there<00:02:46.880> are<00:02:46.970> three<00:02:47.180> main<00:02:47.360> ways<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> manipulate

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
there are three main ways to manipulate

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.410 
there are three main ways to manipulate
selections<00:02:50.470> move<00:02:51.730> which<00:02:52.730> pulls<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.120> selection

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
selections move which pulls a selection

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.980 
selections move which pulls a selection
in<00:02:53.750> any<00:02:54.020> direction<00:02:57.580> rotate<00:02:58.580> which<00:02:59.480> rotates<00:02:59.870> a

in any direction rotate which rotates a

in any direction rotate which rotates a
selection<00:03:00.440> around<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.890> manipulators

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490

position<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:04.390> scale<00:03:05.560> which<00:03:06.560> increases<00:03:07.190> or

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
position and scale which increases or

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.590 
position and scale which increases or

decreases the size of a selection

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.960 
decreases the size of a selection
there's<00:03:11.600> also<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.900> multi-use<00:03:12.500> tool<00:03:12.970> that

there's also a multi-use tool that
allows<00:03:14.150> me<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.360> pick<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.810> mode<00:03:15.020> on<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.620> fly
