00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.699 
those moments while you were there
looking<00:03:25.239> back<00:03:25.599> at<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.930> earth<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.290> realize

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
looking back at the earth you realize

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.680 
looking back at the earth you realize
that<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.980> were<00:03:27.099> on<00:03:27.190> another<00:03:27.340> planet<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
that you were on another planet and I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.270 
that you were on another planet and I
can<00:03:28.900> almost<00:03:29.019> transform<00:03:29.590> my<00:03:29.709> body<00:03:29.739> certainly

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
can almost transform my body certainly

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.789 
can almost transform my body certainly
my<00:03:30.549> mind<00:03:30.819> through<00:03:31.239> time<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.660> space

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
my mind through time and space

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.240 
my mind through time and space
instantaneously<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.190> spot<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.610> moon<00:03:33.819> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
instantaneously to that spot on a moon I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.530 
instantaneously to that spot on a moon I
don't<00:03:36.250> want<00:03:36.430> him<00:03:36.580> when<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.760> look<00:03:36.940> at<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> moment

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
don't want him when I look at the moment

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.710 
don't want him when I look at the moment
