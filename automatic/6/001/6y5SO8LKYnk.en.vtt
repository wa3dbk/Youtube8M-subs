00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
with those you can see the level of oats

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.420 
with those you can see the level of oats
here<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.619> road<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> wolves<00:00:20.279> are

weeds<00:00:22.560> surface<00:00:23.539> I've<00:00:24.539> been<00:00:24.720> using<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.439> for

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
weeds surface I've been using these for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
weeds surface I've been using these for
quite<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> few<00:00:27.119> years<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.900> did<00:00:28.080> quite<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.349> lot

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
quite a few years now we did quite a lot

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.720 
quite a few years now we did quite a lot
of<00:00:28.619> some

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of some

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
of some
just<00:00:30.060> experimental<00:00:30.720> work<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.110> farm<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just experimental work on the farm to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.200 
just experimental work on the farm to
see<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.330> point<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.990> had<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> copy<00:00:34.650> oats

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
see at what point you had to copy oats

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.110 
see at what point you had to copy oats
and<00:00:36.210> leave<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> field<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> know

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
and leave them at the field you know

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.900 
and leave them at the field you know
when<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.900> sea<00:00:41.080> -<00:00:41.320> became<00:00:41.710> viable<00:00:42.250> so<00:00:42.490> knowing

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
when the sea - became viable so knowing

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.310 
when the sea - became viable so knowing
what<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.150> can<00:00:43.300> actually<00:00:43.420> leave<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.930> seat<00:00:44.110> on

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
what you can actually leave the seat on

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.220 
what you can actually leave the seat on
the<00:00:44.410> ground<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.640> even<00:00:46.360> cut<00:00:46.570> by<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.780> weeds<00:00:47.020> over

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
the ground I even cut by the weeds over

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.600 
the ground I even cut by the weeds over
and<00:00:47.680> then<00:00:47.770> not<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.220> germinate<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:50.140> basically

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and then not to germinate and basically

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.970 
and then not to germinate and basically
when<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.760> oat<00:00:51.989> plant<00:00:52.989> starts<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.739> flower

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
when the oat plant starts to flower

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.270 
when the oat plant starts to flower
you've<00:00:54.940> got<00:00:55.180> about<00:00:55.630> a<00:00:55.840> week<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.470> get<00:00:56.949> anything

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
you've got about a week to get anything

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.229 
you've got about a week to get anything
cut<00:00:57.520> before<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> seeds<00:00:59.110> then<00:00:59.440> become<00:00:59.800> viable

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cut before the seeds then become viable

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.750 
cut before the seeds then become viable
ten<00:01:01.239> days<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.690> absolutely<00:01:02.080> stretch<00:01:02.410> but<00:01:02.760> once

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
ten days and absolutely stretch but once

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.060 
ten days and absolutely stretch but once
against<00:01:04.059> ten<00:01:04.330> days<00:01:04.600> there's<00:01:05.290> no<00:01:05.440> doubt<00:01:05.650> it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
against ten days there's no doubt it's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.660 
against ten days there's no doubt it's
here<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.310> seeds<00:01:06.520> do<00:01:06.790> become<00:01:07.240> viable<00:01:07.510> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
here the seeds do become viable but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.690 
here the seeds do become viable but
sending<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.790> seeds<00:01:10.060> off<00:01:10.300> -<00:01:10.540> no<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:10.990> am<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:12.369> found

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
sending the seeds off - no I am we found

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.070 
sending the seeds off - no I am we found
that<00:01:12.820> if<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.060> cut<00:01:13.240> them<00:01:13.390> within<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.690> week<00:01:13.899> of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
that if we cut them within a week of

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.460 
that if we cut them within a week of
flowering<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:15.610> were<00:01:15.670> not<00:01:16.030> liable<00:01:16.330> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
flowering then they were not liable and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.500 
flowering then they were not liable and
it's<00:01:19.010> also<00:01:19.160> quite<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.730> is<00:01:19.910> what<00:01:20.090> I'm<00:01:20.180> talking

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's also quite this is what I'm talking

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.060 
it's also quite this is what I'm talking
there's<00:01:20.660> one<00:01:20.810> whistles<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.560> energy<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.920> see

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
there's one whistles of energy to see

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.680 
there's one whistles of energy to see
them<00:01:22.190> as<00:01:22.280> well<00:01:22.430> because<00:01:22.670> I'm<00:01:23.000> supposed<00:01:23.390> to

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
them as well because I'm supposed to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.310 
them as well because I'm supposed to
vote<00:01:23.870> for<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.200> flower<00:01:25.090> but<00:01:26.090> anyway<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.750> seeds

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
vote for the flower but anyway the seeds

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.550 
vote for the flower but anyway the seeds
that<00:01:27.440> we<00:01:27.680> had<00:01:28.040> back<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:29.180> cut<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:30.260> we<00:01:30.410> had

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
that we had back that we cut that we had

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.210 
that we had back that we cut that we had
testified<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.160> were<00:01:32.090> not

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
testified I were not

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.550 
testified I were not
we're<00:01:34.790> not<00:01:34.910> able<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.300> Germany<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.110> come

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
we're not able to Germany here we come

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.880 
we're not able to Germany here we come
within<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.920> week<00:01:36.950> flowering<00:01:38.470> it's<00:01:39.470> certainly

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
within a week flowering it's certainly

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.270 
within a week flowering it's certainly
not<00:01:40.100> ideal<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:43.370> just<00:01:43.580> change<00:01:44.000> over<00:01:44.210> here

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
not ideal so just change over here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.090 
not ideal so just change over here
it's<00:01:46.640> certainly<00:01:47.030> not<00:01:47.440> an<00:01:48.440> ideal<00:01:48.860> way<00:01:49.040> of

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's certainly not an ideal way of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.620 
it's certainly not an ideal way of
dealing<00:01:49.370> with<00:01:49.460> those<00:01:49.640> but<00:01:49.970> I'm<00:01:50.210> giving<00:01:50.450> this

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
dealing with those but I'm giving this

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.620 
dealing with those but I'm giving this
level<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.290> boats<00:01:52.010> it's<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:53.090> only<00:01:53.240> option<00:01:53.450> we

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
level of boats it's the only option we

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.560 
level of boats it's the only option we
really<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:54.820> we<00:01:55.820> will<00:01:56.000> expect<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> come<00:01:56.510> back

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
really have we will expect to come back

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.290 
really have we will expect to come back
in<00:01:56.930> again<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.290> do<00:01:57.680> copy<00:01:58.280> oats<00:01:58.550> again<00:01:58.910> because

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
in again and do copy oats again because

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.060 
in again and do copy oats again because
they<00:01:59.450> then<00:01:59.630> tear<00:01:59.870> out<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> lower<00:02:00.680> tell<00:02:00.979> us

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
they then tear out and the lower tell us

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.600 
they then tear out and the lower tell us
of<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.280> color

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
of the color

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.990 
of the color
but<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.660> after<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.960> twice<00:02:04.490> maybe<00:02:05.490> possibly

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
but then after that twice maybe possibly

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.930 
but then after that twice maybe possibly
three<00:02:06.180> times<00:02:06.210> depending<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:07.380> bad

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
three times depending on a very bad

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.850 
three times depending on a very bad
infestation

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.160 

I<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:13.610> had<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:13.940> further<00:02:14.330> thoughts<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
I just had some further thoughts on the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.330 
I just had some further thoughts on the
wheat<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:16.040> wanted<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.840> share<00:02:17.840> with<00:02:18.050> you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040 

one<00:02:20.910> thing<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.390> found<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.840> got<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> be

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
one thing that we found it got to be

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.320 
one thing that we found it got to be
very<00:02:22.230> careful<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.860> when<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.760> eat<00:02:23.819> something<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
very careful of when we eat something is

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.500 
very careful of when we eat something is
not<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.750> clip<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> tops<00:02:26.010> off<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.520> ears<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
not to clip the tops off the ears of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
not to clip the tops off the ears of
wheat<00:02:27.980> when<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> first<00:02:29.340> started<00:02:29.670> doing<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
wheat when I first started doing it I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
wheat when I first started doing it I
thought<00:02:30.209> well<00:02:30.390> actually<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.380> flip

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
thought well actually we do just flip

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.589 
thought well actually we do just flip
the<00:02:31.680> tops<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.160> wheat<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.480> know

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
the tops of the wheat then you know

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.479 
the tops of the wheat then you know
that's<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> tail<00:02:34.950> core<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
that's just really the tail core that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.650 
that's just really the tail core that
you'd<00:02:35.640> probably<00:02:35.910> clean<00:02:36.900> out<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.599> if

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you'd probably clean out you know if

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.110 
you'd probably clean out you know if
you're<00:02:39.840> cleaning<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.410> seed<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.970> that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
you're cleaning your seed but and that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.440 
you're cleaning your seed but and that
probably<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.810> case<00:02:43.019> but<00:02:43.550> what<00:02:44.550> actually

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
probably is the case but what actually

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.880 
probably is the case but what actually
then<00:02:45.599> happened<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> years<00:02:46.410> where<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.680> did

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
then happened in the years where we did

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.309 
then happened in the years where we did
in<00:02:47.160> heavy<00:02:47.400> infestation<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.390> oats<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.959> try<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
in heavy infestation of oats and try and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.530 
in heavy infestation of oats and try and
get<00:02:49.440> all<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.739> them<00:02:49.830> where<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.069> did<00:02:50.250> clip<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
get all of them where we did clip the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.830 
get all of them where we did clip the
tops<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.959> wheat<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:53.970> found<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.690> had

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
tops the wheat we then found that we had

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.040 
tops the wheat we then found that we had
quite<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.110> lot<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> bumps<00:02:55.680> getting<00:02:56.069> into<00:02:56.989> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
quite a lot of bumps getting into the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.380 
quite a lot of bumps getting into the
we<00:02:59.560> tears<00:02:59.890> later<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.760> course<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.150> can

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
we tears later on and of course that can

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.440 
we tears later on and of course that can
be<00:03:01.420> pretty<00:03:02.140> much<00:03:02.380> devastate<00:03:02.890> your<00:03:03.010> harvest

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
be pretty much devastate your harvest

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.790 
be pretty much devastate your harvest
the<00:03:04.450> level<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.780> months<00:03:05.020> we<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.350> when<00:03:05.530> we<00:03:05.650> did

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
the level of months we have when we did

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.980 
the level of months we have when we did
was<00:03:05.980> still<00:03:06.160> low<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.300> certainly<00:03:07.570> flagged

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
was still low but it certainly flagged

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.840 
was still low but it certainly flagged
up<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.410> actually<00:03:08.620> if<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:08.980> start<00:03:09.280> damaging

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
up that actually if you start damaging

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.940 
up that actually if you start damaging
the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.820 
the
the<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> weeks<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.840> open<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the of the weeks then you open it up to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.729 
the of the weeks then you open it up to
other<00:03:13.920> diseases<00:03:14.989> bruising<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.319> cutting

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
other diseases bruising it and cutting

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.559 
other diseases bruising it and cutting
it<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.680> lead<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.569> you

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
it and and that then can lead to you

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.880 
it and and that then can lead to you
know<00:03:21.630> contamination<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.380> grain<00:03:22.590> store

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
know contamination in the grain store

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.380 
know contamination in the grain store
and<00:03:23.190> pretty<00:03:23.910> much<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.420> disaster<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.650> crop

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
and pretty much a disaster for your crop

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.920 
and pretty much a disaster for your crop
so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
so

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.720 
so
that's<00:03:28.500> one<00:03:28.830> thing<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.099> have<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
that's one thing you have to be very

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.210 
that's one thing you have to be very
wary<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.930> also<00:03:31.080> where<00:03:31.950> we're<00:03:32.069> going

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
wary of and also where we're going

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800 
wary of and also where we're going
inside<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.700> early<00:03:32.909> this<00:03:33.060> before<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> week<00:03:33.659> is

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
inside the early this before the week is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.080 
inside the early this before the week is
out<00:03:34.379> they<00:03:35.010> need<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.370> black<00:03:35.610> grassland

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
out they need to be black grassland

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.000 
out they need to be black grassland
Charlotte<00:03:36.450> was<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.019> little<00:03:37.319> bit<00:03:37.409> like<00:03:37.620> careful

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
Charlotte was a little bit like careful

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.559 
Charlotte was a little bit like careful
cutting<00:03:38.280> too<00:03:38.519> much<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.849> flag<00:03:39.120> leaf<00:03:39.330> off

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
cutting too much to flag leaf off

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.270 
cutting too much to flag leaf off
because<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.560> course<00:03:40.739> that's<00:03:40.890> where<00:03:41.099> your

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
because of course that's where your

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.000 
because of course that's where your
yield<00:03:41.519> come<00:03:41.760> from
