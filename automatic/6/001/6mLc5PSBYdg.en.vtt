00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 and so hi everyone we get 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:10.019
 found for a mega yachts so here 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 with helicopter yes so some 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 hours of construction that's pretty hard to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.070
 to make some small additions compared 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.949
 in the image including windows and so 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.710
 it was just hot enough to redo it to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.449
 the minecraft version for example that and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.430
 large windows I added them 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.809
 otherwise it was just extremely ugly 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 on the picture so a real yacht 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.540
 it does not hurt but on the other hand goes when 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.750
 we do it on minecraft it's really 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.579
 ugly so here it is there it is not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.539
 arranged apart from a few small places 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 sees the man in eco earth if not with the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.219
 little h which is covered by 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 the helicopter 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.660
 so if you want a tutorial for 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.809
 the helicopter tell me you put 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.450
 a tutorial sign second person 28 obame 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.090
 is a green thumb on the comment 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.580
 please do not rewrite a tutorial 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 bah is suddenly empty the gym had a 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 large canopy 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.820
 we're going to call it that so that's 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.180
 windows normal bars they 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 were already at the boat so here is so 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.259
 floor below up and that's it's just 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.270
 huge so I did not arrange my 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 so tell me what you think 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 that's all we just did like that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740
 hop 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 So here we are, here we go, I put a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.470
 Jacuzzi low as history it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 is pretty much bodies and so that's it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.860
 as if the shot says it does not hurt 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.509
 here is the good old technique 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 so is a breathtaking view of the sea 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.450
 and other boats but this one's 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.069
 miss the one next door 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.660
 I find it missed by 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.349
 personally look i find ugly 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.269
 I do not have you so I would like to see 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.519
 a tutorial or how we do these cabins 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.980
 what I do but not at all 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.670
 looked at limoges if the cabin was 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.910
 better done 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.190
 the boat would be really beautiful 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.090
 but you will see on the image but that's it 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.910
 so this is my little yacht 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.450
 little little yes to these little ones but enough 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.370
 So here great together with 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.280
 small engines at the rear that will have to 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.459
 aulas I did like that here I have 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.319
 tested a new form of engine so 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.489
 especially do not hesitate to tell me what 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.310
 what do you think 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.459
 if you want others so I think 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.280
 that I would not make so bad 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.030
 is less hard even though its bigger 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 it's okay I want some less hard 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.239
 because trying to do them what 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.030
 is just 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:24.910
 huge here I go on the picture I 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 tried to do about the same low 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.090
 still happy because I'm inspired 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.549
 of a picture but here's what 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.709
 each kokhba flat is here except we 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.019
 so sees my bass textures pack and 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:48.160
 modern hd i think yes it's modern hd 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.290
 So here are some small ones 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.019
 add two windows as I say 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.790
 but really to make it good 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.310
 it's not for the pleasure of adding 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.500
 because the savannah 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.730
 but suddenly here I said elevated 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.790
 then you will tell me but why 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.250
 raise a floor in fact low that is 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.610
 quite normal what these windows 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.859
 it was like that and the tall windows 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.490
 of Advent was raised a block 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.500
 so that's why I raised this 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.020
 place there if we see well in the 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.710
 boat except we see nothing or there 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:38.460
 down here it was raised so sir 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.180
 I find it pretty well enough 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.550
 happy what is spoiling a little this 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 boat it's the cabins everywhere that I 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.030
 does not manage to actually actually see 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.460
 so I'll let you down on this on 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.849
 this little picture and so I say hi 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.849
 everybody
