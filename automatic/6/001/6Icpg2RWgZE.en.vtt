00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 "Are organic foods safer?" 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.030
 The established principles of organic farming 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.490
 are "health, ecology, fairness and care". 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.519
 But when you ask people why they buy organic food 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.189
 fear was the strongest indicator 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.040
 about their own health or about the health of their family members. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.310
 People can spend more on organic food 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.849
 from selfish rather than altruistic reasons. 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.169
 While organic foods may not contain more nutrients per unit of currency, 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.460
 their consumption may reduce exposure 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.160
 antibiotic-resistant pesticide residues and bacteria. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 In general, no risk was identified for food safety 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.480
 contamination with food poisoning bacteria. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.870
 Both organic and conventional animal products have been commonly contaminated 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.660
 eg Salmonella or Campylobacter. 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.030
 Most chicken meat samples were found to be contaminated, 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.350
 either Campylobacter or about one-third of Salmonella. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.160
 But the risk of exposure to multi-drug resistant bacteria 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.180
 resistant to multiple antibiotic groups 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.579
 it was lower for meat in organic quality. 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.009
 So both can bear a similar risk of getting sick, 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.049
 but food poisoning from biomass 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.030
 it may be easier for doctors to cure. 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.299
 And what about pesticides? 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.420
 There is a great deal of evidence on the context 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.109
 between pesticide exposure and increased chronic disease rates, 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.299
 such as various types of cancer, diabetes, 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.659
 neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.259
 and ALS, similar to birth defects and reproductive disorders. 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.439
 However, here we are talking about people who live or work with pesticides. 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.049
 For example, Salinas Valley, California 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.139
 where they disperse a quarter of a million kilograms. 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.319
 If a woman dares to get pregnant in such an agricultural community, 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.340
 it may harm the baby's brain development. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.389
 So much so that pregnant women who have the highest levels in their bodies 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:56.889
 measured by urine samples 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:02.729
 children were born with an average deficit of around 7 IQ points. 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.789
 26 out of 27 studies have shown negative effects of pesticides 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.660
 on the development of children's brain. 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.360
 These were problems with attention, 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.159
 developmental disorders and short-term memory problems. 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.260
 If you compare born babies with those in umbilical cord 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.129
 blood levels of a common insecticide, 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.560
 then those that have been exposed to higher levels, 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 were born with brain anomalies. And they were children of the city, 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.829
 so it is probably caused by pesticides used in homes. 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.280
 Exposure of the population to pesticides 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.349
 as the use of insecticides inside your home 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.280
 it can be a contributing factor for various cancers such as childhood leukemia. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.439
 This suggests that the population has increased 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.159
 awareness that pesticides have 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.310
 potentially detrimental to their children's health. 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.489
 Although I can't imagine that most of the agricultural workers have a choice. 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.250
 There is a double risk of pregnant women working on farms 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.879
 that their child gets leukemia. 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.290
 And the risk of developing brain tumors increases. 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.189
 So traditional crops can be harmful 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.000
 for pregnant women who are harvesting them. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.469
 But what about our own family when we eat them? 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.549
 Spraying pesticides on crops in fields 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.150
 it does not necessarily mean that they end up in our bodies when we eat these crops. 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.079
 So at least we didn't know until this study was published in 2006. 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.849
 Researchers measured levels of two pesticides 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.370
 occurring in the body of the children by measuring 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.629
 specific pesticide degradation products in their urine. 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.180
 Here is the level of pesticides circulating through the bodies 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.870
 children aged 3 to 11 in a few days on a regular diet. 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.530
 Then they changed their food to bio for 5 days, and then they changed it 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.530
 again on a normal diet. 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.620
 It is clear that organic foods provide dramatic and immediate 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.319
 protective effect against exposure to pesticides 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.219
 commonly used in agricultural production. 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.889
 The study was subsequently extended. 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.120
 Do you guess in which case children ate organic food? 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.760
 You do not need any graph markers to answer. 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.239
 But what about adults? 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.739
 It wasn't known ... Until now. 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.650
 Three men and women consumed seven days of food, 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.160
 consisting of at least 80% organic food or conventional food. 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.310
 Then their eating plans changed. 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.170
 There was no surprise. During the week mostly on organic food 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.000
 pesticide exposure has been significantly reduced, 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.600
 so not just a little. 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.970
 There was almost a 90% decrease in exposure. 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.190
 So it can be stated that the consumption of organic food 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.440
 provides protection against pesticides 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.710
 does it also mean protection against disease? 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.750
 We don't know - studies just haven't been done yet. 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.340
 However, in the meantime, it provides consumption of organic food 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.540
 logical preventive approach.
