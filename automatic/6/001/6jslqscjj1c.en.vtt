00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.940
 in reviewing the game one of the most 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.430
 old that he was not even capable of 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.650
 support the online game months later

 new characters and included a fighter 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.409
 of karate and takahashi a fighter of

 sumo that debuted in virtua fighter 3 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.170
 finally in 2010 the r version is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 it became the final showdown the same 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.040
 game with slight adjustments and the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.619
 possibility to configure the outfits 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.629
 of the fighters given that they have passed 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.580
 five years since the original launch 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.440
 of the game in domestic version 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.440
 sega gives us the possibility to acquire 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.519
 the latest version of virtua fighter 5 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.620
 directly from the online stores of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.620
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 Y 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 two 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.909
 The first thing that catches my attention is that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.340
 after five years the game continues 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.200
 being a visual delight there are certain 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.210
 details in some sets that can 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.670
 sing a bit but together it's still 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.409
 shining like the first day the effects 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.479
 of lighting the movement of 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.850
 characters and the finishing of them 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.070
 be able to stand the test of time 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.210
 in such a way is something that says 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.210
 very much of a game 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 if you have not put yourself under the control of a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.040
 virtua fighter you should never know that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 it's not an easy game to master despite 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 to be controlled with just 3 buttons on 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
 list of combos of each character is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.099
 huge and drive chains 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.959
 combos must be very precise if you want 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.660
 that really chained the blows of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.610
 unavoidable way you already know that the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 practice towards the teacher and virtua 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 fighter 5 is a game that asks for many 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.160
 hours of investment before you start 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.160
 see the fruits of training 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 bye 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.200
 The offer is more than enough beyond 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 of the arcade mode you will find a series 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.459
 of fairly easy challenges a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 tutorial that reels point by point the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.609
 game mechanics mode 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.769
 training so you can try what 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.620
 you want and of course the online mode 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.180
 an inexhaustible source of fun I 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 I think it's enough for a game of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.540
 fight 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.410
 being sincere virtua fighter 5 final 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.970
 showdown has made me rediscover a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.190
 awesome fighting game with some 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 tremendous possibilities taking into 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.190
 account the price at which I arrive would go 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.190
 by the head 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 for his eyes
