00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
up shallow enough and fish with I mean

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.779 
up shallow enough and fish with I mean
when<00:01:08.110> these<00:01:08.259> fish<00:01:08.500> get<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.979> beds<00:01:09.250> if<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.580> have

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
when these fish get on beds if you have

cover I mean these fish will still come
chase<00:01:15.550> something<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.060> mean<00:01:16.210> especially<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:16.869> you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
chase something I mean especially if you

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.389 
chase something I mean especially if you
hover<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.350> over<00:01:17.410> there<00:01:17.679> better<00:01:17.890> if<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.160> twitch

it down over the top of their bed and

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.990 
it down over the top of their bed and
then<00:01:20.440> let<00:01:20.619> it<00:01:20.649> rise<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.250> push<00:01:21.429> it<00:01:21.580> again<00:01:21.820> and

of this this mix stick 115 shallow
floater<00:01:26.290> I<00:01:26.439> mean<00:01:26.650> you<00:01:26.740> can<00:01:26.920> still<00:01:27.250> adjust<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
floater I mean you can still adjust the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.399 
floater I mean you can still adjust the
weight<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.540> if<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.720> want<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:28.990> hover<00:01:29.200> the

weight on it so if you want to hover the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.170 
weight on it so if you want to hover the
bait<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:30.280> keep<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.729> right<00:01:30.880> there<00:01:31.090> in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
bait you can keep it right there in

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.490 
bait you can keep it right there in
their<00:01:31.270> face<00:01:31.479> but<00:01:31.780> if<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.990> wanted<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.380> have

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
that buoyant action and just twitch it

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.940 
that buoyant action and just twitch it
over<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.390> top<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.869> them<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.259> mean<00:01:35.650> it's<00:01:35.829> gonna

over the top of them I mean it's gonna
be<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.189> baked<00:01:36.430> it'll<00:01:36.729> they'll<00:01:37.119> really<00:01:37.479> get

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
be a baked it'll they'll really get

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.960 
be a baked it'll they'll really get
their<00:01:37.840> attention<00:01:38.130> depth<00:01:39.130> wise<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.729> mean<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
their attention depth wise I mean you

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.280 
their attention depth wise I mean you
want<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.240> be<00:01:40.329> up<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.720> zone<00:01:40.930> where<00:01:40.990> these

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
want to be up in that zone where these

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.190 
want to be up in that zone where these
fish<00:01:41.500> are<00:01:41.740> either<00:01:42.009> garden<00:01:42.549> fry<00:01:43.200> actually

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
fish are either garden fry actually

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.920 
fish are either garden fry actually
spawning<00:01:44.530> or<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:46.000> know<00:01:46.119> just<00:01:46.150> finishing<00:01:46.630> up

the<00:01:47.079> spawn<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.500> starting<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.860> feed<00:01:48.009> back<00:01:48.220> up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
the spawn and starting to feed back up

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.780 
the spawn and starting to feed back up
again<00:01:49.619> getting<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.799> thing<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.310> think<00:01:51.579> i'ma

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790
