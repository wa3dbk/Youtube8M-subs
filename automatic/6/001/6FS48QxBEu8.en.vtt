they<00:02:44.190> did<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> great<00:02:45.329> job<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
they did a great job with just the

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.699 
they did a great job with just the
material<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.700> itself<00:02:48.349> definite<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> way

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
material in itself definite like the way

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.000 
material in itself definite like the way
hope<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.069> design<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:51.420> over<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.109> whole<00:02:52.319> case

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
hope the design goes over the whole case

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.220 
hope the design goes over the whole case
itself<00:02:53.489> where<00:02:54.329> sometimes<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.079> lot<00:02:55.200> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
itself where sometimes you see a lot of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.720 
itself where sometimes you see a lot of
silicone<00:02:55.530> cases<00:02:55.829> they<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.069> designs<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
silicone cases they have designs and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.460 
silicone cases they have designs and
it's<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> back<00:02:57.930> end<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.349> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
it's just on the on the back end of it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's just on the on the back end of it
and<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.639> much<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and they really don't do much on the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.599 
and they really don't do much on the
side<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.630> thing<00:03:00.870> has<00:03:01.019> got<00:03:01.430> design<00:03:02.430> all

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
side so this thing has got design all

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.629 
side so this thing has got design all
the<00:03:02.700> way<00:03:02.790> around<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:05.310> ahead<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.549> put

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
the way around it's go ahead and put
