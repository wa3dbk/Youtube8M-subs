00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
are worn usually ring up lower I got

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.330 
are worn usually ring up lower I got
some<00:02:17.720> forties<00:02:18.140> coins<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.680> Roosevelt<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
worn nickel pretty close to here so I'm

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.490 
worn nickel pretty close to here so I'm
thinking<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.049> probably<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.769> 40s<00:02:25.519> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
thinking this is probably a 40s a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
thinking this is probably a 40s a
half-dollar<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.799> good<00:02:27.950> shape<00:02:33.430> let's<00:02:34.430> see
