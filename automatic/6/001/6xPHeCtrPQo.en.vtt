00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
still just when you think it out it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.550 
still just when you think it out it's
very<00:02:33.239> innovative

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
very innovative

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.390 
very innovative
it's<00:02:35.100> literally<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.950> ten<00:02:37.950> minutes

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
and taken down in about the same time

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.890 
and taken down in about the same time
it's<00:02:40.769> quite<00:02:40.980> lightweight<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.760> well<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.570> looks

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's quite lightweight as well it looks

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's quite lightweight as well it looks
very<00:02:43.079> simple<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> future

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
very simple to do this is the future

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.900 
very simple to do this is the future
well<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:46.079> an<00:02:46.230> alternative<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.489> I've

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
well it's an alternative I think I've

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.460 
well it's an alternative I think I've
just<00:02:47.940> wait<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:48.989> all<00:02:49.079> certainly

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
just wait and see but it's all certainly

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.170 
just wait and see but it's all certainly
a<00:02:49.530> lot<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.680> interest<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.970> could

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
a lot of interest of it and it could

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.460 
a lot of interest of it and it could
take<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> lot<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.600> paint<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.170> put<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.410> a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
take a lot of paint up to put in a

for an awning a good top quality on it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.210 
for an awning a good top quality on it
if<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.020> leave<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.500> awning<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:04.920> for<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.100> long

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
if you leave that awning up for a long

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.460 
if you leave that awning up for a long
period<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.610> time<00:03:05.850> if<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.690> only<00:03:06.870> use<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.140> on

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and say a couple of times a year because

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.490 
and say a couple of times a year because
you're<00:03:09.690> gonna<00:03:09.780> put<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.080> up<00:03:10.200> when<00:03:10.380> you're

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
you're gonna put it up when you're

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110 
you're gonna put it up when you're
actually<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.890> holiday<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.730> not<00:03:11.970> in

actually on that holiday and not in
between<00:03:12.210> times<00:03:12.780> then<00:03:13.440> probably<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
between times then probably it's not a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.890 
between times then probably it's not a
good<00:03:14.490> idea<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.880> spend<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.180> lot<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.420> money<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
good idea to spend a lot of money on it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.530 
good idea to spend a lot of money on it
so<00:03:16.560> do<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> little<00:03:17.160> bit<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.460> research<00:03:18.210> because

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
so do a little bit of research because

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.290 
so do a little bit of research because
there<00:03:19.140> are<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.560> money<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.670> good<00:03:21.150> on

it will last you a long long time when

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.260 
it will last you a long long time when
the<00:03:25.890> noise<00:03:25.980> taking<00:03:26.640> down<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.940> needs<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.150> be

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
the noise taking down it needs to be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.140 
the noise taking down it needs to be
