it's<00:00:07.520> also<00:00:07.670> is<00:00:09.100> first<00:00:10.100> where<00:00:10.910> we<00:00:11.059> built<00:00:11.240> an

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
it's also is first where we built an

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.050 
it's also is first where we built an
entire<00:00:11.480> airplane<00:00:12.310> from<00:00:13.310> laser<00:00:13.610> sintered

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.060 
entire airplane from laser sintered

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.410 
entire airplane from laser sintered
powder<00:00:14.330> and<00:00:14.890> there<00:00:15.890> are<00:00:16.010> no<00:00:16.189> fasteners<00:00:17.090> in<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
powder and there are no fasteners in the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.520 
powder and there are no fasteners in the
entire<00:00:17.689> airplane<00:00:19.900> most<00:00:20.900> airplanes<00:00:21.200> of<00:00:21.440> this

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
entire airplane most airplanes of this

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.410 
entire airplane most airplanes of this
class<00:00:21.800> are<00:00:22.010> full<00:00:22.280> of<00:00:22.460> things<00:00:22.670> like<00:00:22.940> this<00:00:23.210> and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
class are full of things like this and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.850 
class are full of things like this and
therefore<00:00:23.900> ever<00:00:24.110> getting<00:00:24.350> lost<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:24.619> is<00:00:24.680> one

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
therefore ever getting lost this is one

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.020 
therefore ever getting lost this is one
I<00:00:24.890> picked<00:00:25.190> up<00:00:25.280> on<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.520> airfield<00:00:25.670> a<00:00:25.880> few

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
I picked up on the airfield a few

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.370 
I picked up on the airfield a few
minutes<00:00:26.240> ago<00:00:26.360> it's<00:00:26.869> fallen<00:00:27.230> out<00:00:27.350> of

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
minutes ago it's fallen out of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.230 
minutes ago it's fallen out of
somebody's<00:00:27.740> aeroplane<00:00:28.190> this<00:00:29.000> aeroplane

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
somebody's aeroplane this aeroplane

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.510 
somebody's aeroplane this aeroplane
doesn't<00:00:29.779> have<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.930> single<00:00:30.289> screw<00:00:30.830> or<00:00:31.070> bolt<00:00:31.130> in

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
doesn't have a single screw or bolt in

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720 
doesn't have a single screw or bolt in
it<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.970> just<00:00:32.210> clips<00:00:32.390> together<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:33.829> can<00:00:34.640> be

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
it it just clips together and can be

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.569 
it it just clips together and can be
designed<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.359> sent<00:00:35.780> by<00:00:36.190> electronic<00:00:37.190> means<00:00:37.310> to

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
designed and sent by electronic means to

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.670 
designed and sent by electronic means to
a<00:00:37.610> manufacturer<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.540> they<00:00:39.230> can<00:00:39.380> print<00:00:39.560> out

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
a manufacturer and they can print out

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.460 
a manufacturer and they can print out
the<00:00:39.829> airplane<00:00:40.220> and<00:00:40.489> assembly<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:41.270> minutes

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.860 

because<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:46.120> aircraft<00:00:47.120> has<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.360> very<00:00:47.660> high

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
because the aircraft has a very high

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.540 
because the aircraft has a very high
wing<00:00:48.140> loading<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.829> therefore<00:00:49.130> flies<00:00:49.370> very

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
wing loading and therefore flies very

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.420 
wing loading and therefore flies very
fast<00:00:49.969> we<00:00:50.930> need<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.260> give<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.469> some<00:00:51.590> help<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.309> get

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
fast we need to give it some help to get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.340 
fast we need to give it some help to get
into<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.820> air<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.079> what<00:00:54.230> this

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
into the air so that's what this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.650 
into the air so that's what this
contraption<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:55.040> all<00:00:55.160> about<00:00:55.540> it's<00:00:56.540> actually

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
contraption is all about it's actually

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.020 
contraption is all about it's actually
very<00:00:56.870> simple<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.700> large

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
very simple it's it's it's a large

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.590 
very simple it's it's it's a large
rubber<00:00:59.300> band<00:00:59.800> essentially<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.980> bungee<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:02.480> we

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
rubber band essentially a bungee that we

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.310 
rubber band essentially a bungee that we
have<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.840> wind<00:01:03.079> up<00:01:03.350> with<00:01:04.250> an<00:01:04.369> electric<00:01:04.729> drill

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
have to wind up with an electric drill

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.020 
have to wind up with an electric drill
just<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.469> give<00:01:06.649> it<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.799> impetus<00:01:07.579> to<00:01:07.790> get<00:01:07.909> it

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
just to give it that impetus to get it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.950 
just to give it that impetus to get it
into<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.420> air

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.320 

it's<00:01:12.830> an<00:01:13.220> incredibly<00:01:14.000> maneuverable

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's an incredibly maneuverable

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.840 
it's an incredibly maneuverable
aeroplane<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.440> got<00:01:15.710> small<00:01:16.070> wing<00:01:16.310> span<00:01:16.580> which

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
aeroplane it's got small wing span which

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.609 
aeroplane it's got small wing span which
means<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.510> can<00:01:17.720> roll<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.200> twist<00:01:18.440> and

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
means it's it can roll and twist and

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.740 
means it's it can roll and twist and
turn<00:01:18.799> in<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.010> sky<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:19.850> very<00:01:20.210> agile

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
turn in the sky it's very agile

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.020 
turn in the sky it's very agile
aeroplane<00:01:21.229> very<00:01:21.470> fast<00:01:21.770> airplane<00:01:22.040> but<00:01:22.850> then

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
aeroplane very fast airplane but then

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.790 
aeroplane very fast airplane but then
it's<00:01:23.450> modeled<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.900> old<00:01:24.110> spitfire<00:01:24.619> wing

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
it's modeled on the old spitfire wing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.830 
it's modeled on the old spitfire wing
shape<00:01:25.070> which<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.729> known<00:01:26.330> for<00:01:26.509> its<00:01:26.630> agility

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
shape which was known for its agility

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.590 
shape which was known for its agility
and<00:01:27.190> good<00:01:28.190> flying<00:01:28.820> characteristics<00:01:29.180> this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and good flying characteristics this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600 
and good flying characteristics this
plane<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.290> joy<00:01:30.650> for<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.009> pilot<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.310> have<00:01:31.520> in

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
plane is a joy for the pilot to have in

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.020 
plane is a joy for the pilot to have in
his<00:01:31.700> hands<00:01:32.500> it's<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.590> nitric<00:01:33.950> powder<00:01:34.190> airplanes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
his hands it's a nitric powder airplanes

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.030 
his hands it's a nitric powder airplanes
it's<00:01:35.300> got<00:01:35.479> two<00:01:35.890> lipo<00:01:36.890> batteries<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:38.590> if<00:01:39.590> you're

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
it's got two lipo batteries in if you're

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.190 
it's got two lipo batteries in if you're
very<00:01:40.820> careful<00:01:40.940> on<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.479> throttle<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.869> can<00:01:42.020> get

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
very careful on the throttle you can get

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.690 
very careful on the throttle you can get
something<00:01:42.440> like<00:01:42.680> 40<00:01:43.040> minutes<00:01:43.250> flight

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
something like 40 minutes flight

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.680 
something like 40 minutes flight
duration<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:46.640> has<00:01:46.789> an<00:01:46.910> auto<00:01:47.030> pilot<00:01:47.509> on<00:01:47.660> board

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
duration it has an auto pilot on board

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.010 
duration it has an auto pilot on board
so<00:01:48.410> although<00:01:49.160> we're<00:01:49.610> relying<00:01:50.179> on<00:01:50.390> our<00:01:50.539> expert

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
so although we're relying on our expert

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.190 
so although we're relying on our expert
test<00:01:51.289> pilot<00:01:51.710> today<00:01:52.630> actually<00:01:53.630> he<00:01:53.899> is

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
test pilot today actually he is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.320 
test pilot today actually he is
redundant<00:01:54.830> as<00:01:55.100> far<00:01:55.310> as<00:01:55.399> our<00:01:55.460> systems<00:01:55.910> concern

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
redundant as far as our systems concern

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570 
redundant as far as our systems concern
so<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.320> could<00:01:57.470> simply<00:01:57.860> simply<00:01:58.190> flick<00:01:58.550> a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
so you could simply simply flick a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.600 
so you could simply simply flick a
switch<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:59.780> would<00:01:59.929> fly<00:02:00.610> pre-programmed

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
switch it would fly pre-programmed

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.210 
switch it would fly pre-programmed
flight<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.119> then<00:02:02.300> come<00:02:02.780> back<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.320> landing

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
flight and then come back to a landing

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.999 
flight and then come back to a landing
point<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:07.550> what<00:02:07.700> happens<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.929> machine<00:02:09.560> has<00:02:09.979> a

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
point so what happens is a machine has a

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.990 
point so what happens is a machine has a
bed<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:11.000> powder<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> lasers<00:02:13.040> directed

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
bed of powder with a lasers directed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.940 
bed of powder with a lasers directed
laser<00:02:14.450> fire<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.900> twitte<00:02:15.080> fire<00:02:15.260> mirrors<00:02:15.709> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
laser fire on twitte fire mirrors and

exposed it's rather interesting and
intricate<00:02:47.959> structure<00:02:48.590> which<00:02:48.829> we've<00:02:49.010> got

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
intricate structure which we've got

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
intricate structure which we've got
inside<00:02:49.610> here<00:02:49.970> which<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> very<00:02:50.989> efficient

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
inside here which is a very efficient

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800

way<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:51.799> reinforcing<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.880> fuselage<00:02:53.329> so<00:02:53.630> I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
way of reinforcing the fuselage so I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.349 
way of reinforcing the fuselage so I
should<00:02:54.079> have<00:02:54.200> control<00:02:54.579> okay<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:55.850> click

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
should have control okay and now click

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.800 
should have control okay and now click
it<00:02:56.510> those<00:02:56.750> facts<00:02:57.320> into<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.769> right<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.310> firm<00:02:59.180> but

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
it those facts into the right a firm but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.830 
it those facts into the right a firm but
great<00:03:00.049> benefit<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:02.269> can<00:03:02.450> have<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.720> as

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
great benefit is that you can have it as

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.020 
great benefit is that you can have it as
complex<00:03:03.320> as<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.519> look<00:03:04.820> at<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
complex as you like if you look at the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.670 
complex as you like if you look at the
inside<00:03:05.359> of<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.600> structure<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.410> see

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
inside of this structure you can see

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.970 
inside of this structure you can see
that<00:03:06.709> there<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.280> really<00:03:07.820> nice<00:03:08.030> click

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
that there is really nice click

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.840 
that there is really nice click
complicated<00:03:09.980> structural<00:03:10.400> design<00:03:10.640> which

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
complicated structural design which

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.539 
complicated structural design which
makes<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.150> very<00:03:11.209> efficient<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.250> see<00:03:13.430> on

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
makes it very efficient you can see on

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.039 
makes it very efficient you can see on
here<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.940> there<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.269> fixtures<00:03:14.840> which

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
here that there are fixtures which

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.530 
here that there are fixtures which
enable<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.950> snap<00:03:16.280> together<00:03:16.540> clips

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
enable the thing to snap together clips

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.170 
enable the thing to snap together clips
so<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.950> kind<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.280> complexity<00:03:19.940> would

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
so this kind of complexity would

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.599 
so this kind of complexity would
ordinarily<00:03:20.389> be<00:03:20.989> involved<00:03:21.919> lots<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.310> different

four pieces the red wing the green wing
the<00:03:31.549> nose<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:32.329> fuselage<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.049> then<00:03:33.439> we<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
the nose the fuselage and then we have a

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.500 
the nose the fuselage and then we have a
separate<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.280> fifth<00:03:34.549> tray<00:03:34.849> to<00:03:34.909> carry<00:03:35.269> all<00:03:35.420> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
separate a fifth tray to carry all the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.470 
separate a fifth tray to carry all the
avionics<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:38.120> whole<00:03:38.299> thing

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
avionics and that's it the whole thing

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.030 
avionics and that's it the whole thing
goes<00:03:38.629> together<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.110> hinges<00:03:39.530> are<00:03:39.709> made

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
goes together the hinges are made

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.910 
goes together the hinges are made
integral<00:03:40.790> with<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> wings<00:03:41.329> so<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.680> flaps

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
integral with the wings so the flaps

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.059 
integral with the wings so the flaps
come<00:03:43.430> out<00:03:43.609> pre-assembled<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.890> technology

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
come out pre-assembled as the technology

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.099 
come out pre-assembled as the technology
allows<00:03:46.609> us<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.819> go<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.239> bigger<00:03:47.569> airplanes

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
allows us to go to bigger airplanes

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.809 
allows us to go to bigger airplanes
because<00:03:48.769> they're<00:03:49.040> building<00:03:49.579> bigger

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
because they're building bigger

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.670 
because they're building bigger
sintering<00:03:50.480> machines<00:03:50.810> we<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.409> push<00:03:51.590> this

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
sintering machines we can push this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.369 
sintering machines we can push this
technology<00:03:52.159> further<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:53.659> think<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.079> next

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
technology further and I think the next

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.039 
technology further and I think the next
step<00:03:54.439> will<00:03:54.739> be<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:54.890> build<00:03:55.250> some<00:03:55.489> bigger<00:03:55.700> wings

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
step will be to build some bigger wings

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.830 
step will be to build some bigger wings
in<00:03:57.049> nylon<00:03:57.560> with<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.340> technology<00:03:58.609> which<00:03:59.450> will

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
in nylon with this technology which will

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.270 
in nylon with this technology which will
incorporate<00:04:00.109> some<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.500> our<00:04:00.709> more<00:04:00.950> advanced

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
incorporate some of our more advanced

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.800 
incorporate some of our more advanced
thinking<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.819> how<00:04:02.030> we<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.299> put<00:04:02.510> control

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
thinking on how we can put control
