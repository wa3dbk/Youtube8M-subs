00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 third point he is introduced today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 Report of the so-called RÃ¼he commission 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.429
 to the parliamentary reservation 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.980
 Federal service missions abroad 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 We rate what's there on the table 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 set will be quite clear as a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 very clear break with the previous one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 practice also the constitution 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 prescribes that the Bundeswehr a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 The parliamentary army is where the German 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.580
 parliament must decide about 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.500
 every use 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 now it is supposed to use different 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.329
 types and at 7 this use 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.329
 types in the future, the Bundeswehr 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.430
 can be used without that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 German parliament becomes involved and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.890
 without it decides about it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 we think that is absolutely unacceptable 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 because there is a danger that the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 deployment of the german army at the end 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 would be decided in brussels or in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.719
 Washington, Obama basically like that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 indirect commander-in-chief of the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 German Federal Armed Forces will find that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.570
 you can not accept at all 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.549
 when the German army is deployed 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 And of course that's where our position stays 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.500
 we do not want foreign assignments though 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 the least is that the parliament over 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 every job must decide and then 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
 at least the majorities here in the know 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 then also be in favor of parliament if they 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.049
 everything else should be used 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.189
 this parliament is auszubooten is 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.530
 unacceptable 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:32.549
 so that it does not exist 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.040
 do not ask for one 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.930
 Demand for just presented to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 just introduced corner score paper of the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.210
 spd to bnd reform 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 in it the spd wants that too out of that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.960
 also aliens from the bnd no more 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 enlightened and spied on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 can be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 Can you share that or what do you say? 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.680
 We have been able to find this for a long time 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 of course the bnd much stronger 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.310
 he has to be checked in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.270
 The past is clearly German 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.579
 pretty broken 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.979
 He has the spying on German 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.680
 from European citizens 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.930
 orchestrated so far we welcome though 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 that there is a stricter legal practice 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.629
 should give 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.300
 but we find what the spd now 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.690
 is completely inadequate the spd is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.990
 Naturally 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.820
 to say in a certain legitimation 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.610
 Mr. Gabriel has only very big 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.140
 Bake inflated in the bnd affair it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.890
 But there is nothing but hot air out 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.690
 come 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.240
 not even the select ears list 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.620
 will be published and tried now 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.890
 I think the spd a bit too 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.780
 to pretend activity we find it 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.060
 must be regulated much stricter 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.600
 and it remains our requirement that the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 cooperation of bnd and nsa long on 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.830
 put ice belongs as long as no two 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.160
 Agreement exists as long as it is allowed at all 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.380
 no delivery of nsa with data 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.060
 european citizen european 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.500
 politicians do not give words anymore 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.640
 ask so we say for future 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.640
 Munich and beautiful day
