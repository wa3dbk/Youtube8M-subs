00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
it's very similar to the intro here so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.600 
it's very similar to the intro here so
if<00:00:17.630> you<00:00:17.750> watch<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.140> previous<00:00:18.500> video<00:00:18.890> on<00:00:19.190> brick

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
extra section comes in about four times

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.420 
extra section comes in about four times
through<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:41.270> pattern<00:00:41.890> left<00:00:42.890> hand<00:00:43.190> plays

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 

okay<00:01:03.720> that's<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.050> verse<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.710> there

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but it's going to lead us into the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
but it's going to lead us into the
chorus<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> slightly<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
chorus in a slightly different way so
