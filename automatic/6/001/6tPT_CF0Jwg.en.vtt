00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.920
 Nobody here needs high end 3d graphics

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 Internet connections glow around the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
 To pursue the phenomenon of minecraft we are 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 to Stockholm 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.360

 another very successful countryman in 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.510
 yours is the programmer of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510
 minecraft markus persson 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.330
 He has his own company right now 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.280

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.840
 his little team related to the new office 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.400
 to be financed office and employees 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.380
 through the financial success of 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.300
 minecraft for the first one 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 viable version has become 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.740

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.030
 the basis of the incredible success of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.040
 minecraft has markus persson whole 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.140
 Alone created a player of the old 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.369
 school 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.560
 I do not have my strength as 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.000
 photorealistic game developed because 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.759
 I alone did not come that way 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 minecraft is inspired by the play 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.610
 I played in the 80s and 90s 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.250
 minecraft has a rather iconic 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.210
 graphic approach a tree does not look 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.670
 like a tree 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 but you know it's a tree minecraft 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.830
 is currently conquering the network in the storm 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.759
 About 50 of the players are still coming 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.240
 from the USA 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.700
 But Europe is catching up with the fans of the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.260
 local games press universe 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.640
 their enthusiasm with preference in 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.640
 youtube videos out 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 and here you get one 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.320
 fascinating insight into the creative 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.390
 create the minecraft worlds farmer 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.430
 in each of these worlds and objects 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.970
 stuck hours days and weeks from 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.970
 development 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.830
 Just look at dame lady 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.830
 virtual cookies 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.420
 Believe it or not 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.400
 minecraft stands despite one 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.180
 incredible success only at the beginning 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.280
 development 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.830
 but like that with virtual worlds 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.310
 the only limit is the one 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.690
 own imagination 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.790
 even if markus persson the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.540
 minecraft developers the enormous success 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.070
 never dreamed of his game 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.290
 no , I do not have such a success 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.640
 that is really bitter but it is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.130
 is really fun to start a company 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.690
 hire employees and with whom 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.670
 To develop the games we enjoy 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.670
 more this is a great opportunity for me 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.800
 As Confucius said, he was looking for that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.910
 job you love and you do not have to 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.910
 work day
