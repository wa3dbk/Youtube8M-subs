a<00:00:22.770> paint<00:00:23.160> job<00:00:23.420> before<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> start<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
a paint job before you start to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
a paint job before you start to
disassemble<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> long<00:00:25.980> strike<00:00:26.400> you're<00:00:26.610> going

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
disassemble the long strike you're going

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
disassemble the long strike you're going
to<00:00:26.880> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.990> bolt<00:00:28.320> handle<00:00:28.590> out<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
to need to take the bolt handle out and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.299 
to need to take the bolt handle out and
a<00:00:29.970> good<00:00:30.420> way<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.470> take<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a good way to do that is to take the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.330 
a good way to do that is to take the
back<00:00:32.609> of<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:33.000> hammer<00:00:33.320> stick<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> underneath<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
back of a hammer stick it underneath and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.939 
back of a hammer stick it underneath and
once<00:00:35.999> you<00:00:36.179> have<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.329> underneath<00:00:36.690> pry<00:00:37.679> it<00:00:37.739> off

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
once you have it underneath pry it off

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.750 
once you have it underneath pry it off
like<00:00:38.339> that<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.569> should<00:00:39.780> come<00:00:40.019> off<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
like that and this should come off and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.079 
like that and this should come off and
you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.999> now<00:00:42.210> remove<00:00:42.749> your<00:00:42.780> bolt<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.879> I've

with<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.050> lot<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> force<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.890> will<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.190> able<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
with a lot of force you will be able to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.960 
with a lot of force you will be able to
detach<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.870> it's<00:02:01.050> not<00:02:01.229> too<00:02:01.830> easy<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.370> detach<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
detach it it's not too easy to detach it

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.030 
detach it it's not too easy to detach it
but<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.360> ok<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.650> don't<00:02:04.800> want<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
but that's ok because you don't want it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.460 
but that's ok because you don't want it
to<00:02:05.159> fall<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:06.240> starting<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.020> break<00:02:07.260> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
to fall out I'm starting to break the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.290 
to fall out I'm starting to break the
shell<00:02:07.710> apart<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.849> need<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.269> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
shell apart and you need to use a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.690 
shell apart and you need to use a
flathead<00:02:09.750> screwdriver<00:02:09.929> because<00:02:10.769> it's<00:02:11.220> glued

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
flathead screwdriver because it's glued

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.020 
flathead screwdriver because it's glued
together<00:02:11.969> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.230> seams<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.430> taking<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
together in the seams so I'm taking a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.309 
together in the seams so I'm taking a
flathead

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
flathead

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.679 
flathead
and<00:02:16.439> my<00:02:16.620> hammer<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.219> I'm<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.879> chiseling<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
and my hammer and I'm just chiseling it

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.309 
and my hammer and I'm just chiseling it
and<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.670> breaking<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.969> bonds<00:02:21.450> but

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
and kind of breaking the bonds but

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
and kind of breaking the bonds but
that's<00:02:22.500> all<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.799> have<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.099> do<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.519> open<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that's all you have to do to open the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
that's all you have to do to open the
long<00:02:24.390> strike<00:02:24.780> stock<00:02:25.109> now<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> little

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
long strike stock now that I'm a little

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.520 
long strike stock now that I'm a little
ways<00:02:26.609> into<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> painting<00:02:27.750> process<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.439> would

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
ways into the painting process I would

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.949 
ways into the painting process I would
like<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.890> guys<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.099> note<00:02:29.609> that<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.879> also<00:02:30.269> paint

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
like you guys to note that I also paint

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.440 
like you guys to note that I also paint
the<00:02:31.049> insides<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:32.579> projects<00:02:33.269> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the insides of all of my projects and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.020 
the insides of all of my projects and
that's<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.129> look<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.730> in

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
that's just so that if you look up in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.420 
that's just so that if you look up in
certain<00:02:36.930> areas<00:02:37.439> I'm<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.829> quite<00:02:38.040> done<00:02:38.069> with

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
certain areas I'm not quite done with

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.660 
certain areas I'm not quite done with
this<00:02:38.579> but<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.109> see<00:02:40.470> black<00:02:40.920> instead<00:02:41.519> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this but you will see black instead of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.690 
this but you will see black instead of
whatever<00:02:41.970> mishmash<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.470> colors<00:02:43.950> were<00:02:44.489> there

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
whatever mishmash of colors were there

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.569 
whatever mishmash of colors were there
before<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.959> also<00:02:46.109> important<00:02:46.829> because<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
before it's also important because you

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.390 
before it's also important because you
get<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.139> inside<00:02:49.139> part<00:02:49.439> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> tactical<00:02:50.159> rail

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
get the inside part of the tactical rail

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.360 
get the inside part of the tactical rail
piece<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.079> sometimes<00:02:52.079> paint<00:02:52.829> doesn't<00:02:53.250> always

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
piece and sometimes paint doesn't always

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.770 
piece and sometimes paint doesn't always
get<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.849> when<00:02:54.150> you're<00:02:54.269> painting<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
get that when you're painting the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.039 
get that when you're painting the
outside<00:02:55.849> okay<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.510> I've<00:02:57.780> finished

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
outside okay so now that I've finished

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.589 
outside okay so now that I've finished
detailing<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.010> gun<00:02:59.159> and<00:02:59.459> applying<00:02:59.849> a<00:03:00.209> clear

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
detailing the gun and applying a clear

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.319 
detailing the gun and applying a clear
protective<00:03:00.870> coat<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:02.459> done<00:03:02.790> some<00:03:03.150> more

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
protective coat I have done some more

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.960 
protective coat I have done some more
modifications<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.470> removed<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.669> air

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
modifications I removed the air

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.179 
modifications I removed the air
restrictor<00:03:06.659> so<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.260> see<00:03:07.530> straight

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
restrictor so you can see straight

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.309 
restrictor so you can see straight
through<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.970> gets<00:03:09.269> better<00:03:09.569> better<00:03:09.959> air

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
through and that gets better better air

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.399 
through and that gets better better air
flow<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.919> I've<00:03:11.519> also<00:03:11.909> put<00:03:12.419> teflon<00:03:12.900> tape

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
flow and I've also put teflon tape

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.339 
flow and I've also put teflon tape
underneath<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.310> o-ring<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.230> lubricated<00:03:16.230> it

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
underneath the o-ring and lubricated it

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.830 
underneath the o-ring and lubricated it
so<00:03:16.769> now<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.129> getting<00:03:17.310> maximum<00:03:18.000> air<00:03:18.239> flow<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
so now I'm getting maximum air flow and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.339 
so now I'm getting maximum air flow and
this<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:20.220> 5<00:03:20.639> kilogram<00:03:21.000> orange<00:03:21.870> mod<00:03:22.109> work

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
this is a 5 kilogram orange mod work

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.949 
this is a 5 kilogram orange mod work
spring<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.099> that's<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:24.449> give<00:03:24.599> me<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> lot

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
spring and that's going to give me a lot

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.719 
spring and that's going to give me a lot
of<00:03:25.079> power<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.859> long<00:03:26.040> strike<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.549> going<00:03:26.579> to

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
of power so this long strike is going to

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.960 
of power so this long strike is going to
be<00:03:26.849> very<00:03:27.569> powerful<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.190> that's<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.609> for<00:03:29.639> now

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
be very powerful but that's it for now

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.460 
be very powerful but that's it for now
I'm<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.449> going<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.629> reassemble<00:03:31.349> everything

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
I'm just going to reassemble everything

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.800 
I'm just going to reassemble everything
and<00:03:32.040> show<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.489> what<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> looks<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.329> once

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and show you what it looks like once

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.860 
and show you what it looks like once
I've<00:03:34.019> done<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.209> my<00:03:36.389> finished

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
I've done that so this is my finished

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.229 
I've done that so this is my finished
nerf<00:03:37.290> long<00:03:37.560> strike<00:03:37.919> commission<00:03:38.400> I'll<00:03:38.909> go<00:03:39.120> over

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
nerf long strike commission I'll go over

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.210 
nerf long strike commission I'll go over
the<00:03:39.449> internal<00:03:40.109> modifications<00:03:40.829> really

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the internal modifications really

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
the internal modifications really
quickly<00:03:41.579> just<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.970> case<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.359> missed<00:03:42.599> them

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
quickly just in case you missed them

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.740 
quickly just in case you missed them
before<00:03:43.169> first<00:03:44.069> off<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.519> remove<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.419> air

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
before first off I remove the air

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990 
before first off I remove the air
restrictor<00:03:46.409> put<00:03:47.010> some<00:03:47.250> teflon<00:03:47.579> tape

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
restrictor put some teflon tape

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.180 
restrictor put some teflon tape
underneath<00:03:48.449> the<00:03:48.810> o-ring<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.739> get<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:49.919> better

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
underneath the o-ring to get a better

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.939 
underneath the o-ring to get a better
air<00:03:50.430> seal<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.090> more<00:03:51.269> airflow<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.799> also

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
air seal and more airflow and I also

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.309 
air seal and more airflow and I also
added<00:03:53.370> an<00:03:53.669> orange<00:03:54.030> mod<00:03:54.269> works<00:03:54.540> replacement

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
added an orange mod works replacement

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.949 
added an orange mod works replacement
spring<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:56.069> addition<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:56.940> also<00:03:57.329> padded

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
spring in addition to that I also padded

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.179 
spring in addition to that I also padded
the<00:03:58.349> priming<00:03:58.889> handle<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.489> some<00:03:59.790> foam<00:04:00.599> and

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
the priming handle with some foam and

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.189 
the priming handle with some foam and
this<00:04:02.189> is<00:04:02.400> not<00:04:02.609> locked<00:04:02.939> in<00:04:03.180> yet<00:04:03.389> because<00:04:03.840> I'm

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
this is not locked in yet because I'm

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.890 
this is not locked in yet because I'm
going<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.530> ship<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.919> and<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:06.150> don't<00:04:06.359> want<00:04:06.780> to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
going to ship it and I don't want to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.170 
going to ship it and I don't want to
have<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.229> take<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.769> out<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:08.129> risk<00:04:08.430> damaging

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
have to take it out and risk damaging

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.000 
have to take it out and risk damaging
the<00:04:09.359> paint<00:04:09.569> but<00:04:10.260> that's<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:10.620> for<00:04:10.889> the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
the paint but that's it for the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.240 
the paint but that's it for the
internals<00:04:11.729> pretty<00:04:12.569> basic<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.919> shooting

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
internals pretty basic and it's shooting

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.029 
internals pretty basic and it's shooting
really<00:04:14.609> well<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.629> now<00:04:15.780> go<00:04:16.049> over<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.560> paints

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
really well so now go over the paints

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.759 
really well so now go over the paints
the<00:04:17.699> base<00:04:17.940> coat<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.539> this<00:04:18.659> commission<00:04:19.259> was<00:04:19.709> a

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
the base coat for this commission was a

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.399 
the base coat for this commission was a
rust-oleum<00:04:20.400> satin<00:04:21.209> black<00:04:21.539> spray<00:04:21.930> paint<00:04:21.959> and

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
rust-oleum satin black spray paint and

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.820 
rust-oleum satin black spray paint and
then<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.310> did<00:04:23.580> little<00:04:23.849> brush<00:04:24.479> details<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.409> blue

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
then I did little brush details in blue

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.190 
then I did little brush details in blue
with<00:04:26.250> Citadel<00:04:27.120> low<00:04:27.360> turn<00:04:27.570> blue<00:04:27.979> overall

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
with Citadel low turn blue overall

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.630 
with Citadel low turn blue overall
I<00:04:29.230> think<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.530> paints<00:04:30.040> turned<00:04:30.250> out<00:04:30.370> really

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
I think the paints turned out really

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.600 
I think the paints turned out really
nice<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.960> color<00:04:32.170> combination

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
nice and I like the color combination

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
nice and I like the color combination
since<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.850> was<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.390> commission<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.200> was<00:04:35.500> told

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
since this was a commission I was told

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.980 
since this was a commission I was told
exactly<00:04:36.220> how<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.670> paint<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.150> with<00:04:37.300> what<00:04:37.630> colors

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
exactly how to paint it with what colors

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.080 
exactly how to paint it with what colors
and<00:04:38.230> everything<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.580> Commissioner

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
and everything and the Commissioner

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.870 
and everything and the Commissioner
requested<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.020> leave<00:04:41.350> an<00:04:41.710> orange<00:04:42.250> tip<00:04:42.640> and

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
requested that I leave an orange tip and

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.720 
requested that I leave an orange tip and
paint<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:44.380> about<00:04:44.680> everything<00:04:45.220> else<00:04:45.400> that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
paint just about everything else that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.090 
paint just about everything else that
led<00:04:46.660> me<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.870> painting<00:04:47.350> things<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.860> usually

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
led me to painting things that I usually

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.430 
led me to painting things that I usually
wouldn't<00:04:48.640> paint<00:04:48.850> like<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.390> jamb<00:04:49.870> door<00:04:50.140> and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
wouldn't paint like the jamb door and

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.880 
wouldn't paint like the jamb door and
the<00:04:50.950> trigger<00:04:51.250> magazine<00:04:52.210> release<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.620> think

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
the trigger magazine release but I think

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.890 
the trigger magazine release but I think
it<00:04:54.010> looks<00:04:54.220> better<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:55.000> way<00:04:55.180> because<00:04:55.570> you

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
it looks better in a way because you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.920 
it looks better in a way because you
don't<00:04:55.930> have<00:04:56.260> as<00:04:56.500> many<00:04:56.800> conflicting<00:04:57.640> colors<00:04:58.000> so

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
don't have as many conflicting colors so

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.080 
don't have as many conflicting colors so
that's<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.290> for<00:04:59.470> everything<00:05:00.160> on<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.790> long

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
that's it for everything on the long

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.330 
that's it for everything on the long
stretch<00:05:01.450> so<00:05:01.720> now<00:05:01.870> I'll<00:05:02.170> show<00:05:02.440> you<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.620> firing

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
stretch so now I'll show you a firing

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:38.980 
stretch so now I'll show you a firing
demo<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.820> some<00:05:04.120> chronograph<00:05:04.750> readings

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.890 

as<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:41.580> can<00:05:41.730> see<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.000> long<00:05:42.180> strike<00:05:42.480> shooting

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
as you can see the long strike shooting

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.170 
as you can see the long strike shooting
pretty<00:05:43.140> well<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.740> huge<00:05:44.370> improvement<00:05:44.790> over

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
pretty well a huge improvement over

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.260 
pretty well a huge improvement over
stock<00:05:45.660> form<00:05:46.020> because<00:05:46.380> this<00:05:47.070> is<00:05:47.340> a<00:05:47.520> n-strike

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
stock form because this is a n-strike

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.470 
stock form because this is a n-strike
reverse<00:05:48.900> plunger<00:05:49.470> blaster<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.340> stock<00:05:51.120> form

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
reverse plunger blaster and stock form

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.020 
reverse plunger blaster and stock form
it's<00:05:51.780> probably<00:05:52.590> shooting<00:05:52.920> about<00:05:53.190> maybe<00:05:53.460> 50

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
it's probably shooting about maybe 50

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.720 
it's probably shooting about maybe 50
feet<00:05:54.240> per<00:05:54.600> second<00:05:55.020> if<00:05:55.170> that<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:56.040> just<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.400> really

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
feet per second if that so just a really

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.930 
feet per second if that so just a really
cool<00:05:57.000> commission<00:05:57.600> overall<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.470> think<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.460> looks

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
cool commission overall I think it looks

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.660 
cool commission overall I think it looks
really<00:06:00.180> good<00:06:00.420> and<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:01.080> fires<00:06:01.380> well<00:06:01.770> so<00:06:02.460> that's

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
really good and it fires well so that's

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.610 
really good and it fires well so that's
all<00:06:02.850> I<00:06:02.880> have<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.360> say<00:06:03.570> on<00:06:03.750> my<00:06:03.930> long<00:06:04.230> strike

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
all I have to say on my long strike

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.460
