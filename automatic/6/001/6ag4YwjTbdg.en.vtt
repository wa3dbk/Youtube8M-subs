00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
in sync where they have to trust each

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
in sync where they have to trust each
other<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.790> 16<00:01:18.210> bodies<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.020> 16

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
other there's 16 bodies and then 16

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.630 
other there's 16 bodies and then 16
bodies<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.799> dancing<00:01:20.070> together<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.460> only

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bodies are dancing together it only

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.740 
bodies are dancing together it only
looks<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.299> they're<00:01:21.390> incomplete

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
looks good when they're incomplete

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
looks good when they're incomplete
unison<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.220> challenging<00:01:23.520> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
unison so I think that's challenging in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
unison so I think that's challenging in
itself<00:01:24.240> there's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> group<00:01:25.439> lift<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.640> they

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
itself there's a group lift which they

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
itself there's a group lift which they
have<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:28.320> gabby<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> have

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have to also have well gabby has to have

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.170 
have to also have well gabby has to have
a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> trust<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> everyone<00:01:30.000> that's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
