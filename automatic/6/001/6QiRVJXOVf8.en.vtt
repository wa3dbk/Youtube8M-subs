year you know Punk lost that match but I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
year you know Punk lost that match but I
guess<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:17.910> he's<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> persona<00:00:18.990> non

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
guess you know he's kind of persona non

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.140 
guess you know he's kind of persona non
grata<00:00:19.470> right<00:00:19.800> now<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.100> WWE<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:21.000> don't

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
grata right now in WWE that they don't

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
grata right now in WWE that they don't
even<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.539> acknowledge<00:00:21.660> him<00:00:22.519> you<00:00:23.519> know

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
even want to acknowledge him you know

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.189 
even want to acknowledge him you know
because<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.119> part<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> work<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
because it's all part of the work of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.970 
because it's all part of the work of
course<00:00:25.500> isn't<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.930> really<00:00:28.680> like

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
course isn't that right I really like

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
course isn't that right I really like
this<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> video<00:00:29.820> focused<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.480> how

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this because the video focused on how

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
this because the video focused on how
much<00:00:30.779> older<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.800> Undertaker<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.550> getting<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
much older the Undertaker is getting the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
much older the Undertaker is getting the
first<00:00:33.239> time<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.809> WWE<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.620> made

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
first time I think WWE has made

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.369 
first time I think WWE has made
Undertaker's<00:00:35.700> age<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.450> issue<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.760> storyline

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
Undertaker's age an issue in a storyline

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.569 
Undertaker's age an issue in a storyline
because<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> guy<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because you know a guy like the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
because you know a guy like the
Undertaker<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.270> don't<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> call<00:00:42.780> him

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.289 
I like that because I agree with that
you<00:01:06.900> can't<00:01:07.140> ignore<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:08.100> may<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.310> well<00:01:08.400> make

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you can't ignore it he may as well make

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
you can't ignore it he may as well make
it<00:01:09.360> part<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> story<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.740> him<00:01:10.950> seem

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it part of the story make him seem

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.070 
it part of the story make him seem
vulnerable<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.450> whole<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
vulnerable the whole thing with the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.300 
vulnerable the whole thing with the
streak<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:13.680> aren't<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:13.920> many<00:01:14.100> people

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
streak is there aren't very many people

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.240 
streak is there aren't very many people
who<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.000> streak<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.330> ever<00:01:15.479> gonna<00:01:15.630> end

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
who think the streak is ever gonna end

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
who think the streak is ever gonna end
because<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> Undertaker<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.479> rarely

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
because the Undertaker is is rarely

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
because the Undertaker is is rarely
vulnerable<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.680> mean<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.920> could<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
vulnerable I mean he could take a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.679 
vulnerable I mean he could take a
beating<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> match<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> end

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
beating in a match but in the end

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
beating in a match but in the end
everybody<00:01:22.140> knows<00:01:22.380> he's<00:01:22.680> gonna<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.159> pin

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
everybody knows he's gonna get the pin

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.999 
everybody knows he's gonna get the pin
or<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.299> submission<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.900> he's<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.110> win<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
or the submission and he's gonna win and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.950 
or the submission and he's gonna win and
and<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:27.000> people<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.600> never<00:01:27.750> be

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and some people will just never be

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
and some people will just never be
convinced<00:01:28.439> otherwise<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.729> think

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
convinced otherwise and I don't think

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.730 
convinced otherwise and I don't think
the<00:01:30.180> streak<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.570> ever<00:01:30.720> end<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the streak will ever end but I like I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
the streak will ever end but I like I
like<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.700> least<00:01:32.790> try<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.930> stuff

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
like them to at least try to do stuff

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
like them to at least try to do stuff
that<00:01:34.439> plants<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> seeds<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> doubt<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that plants the seeds of doubt and so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
that plants the seeds of doubt and so
those<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:37.110> maybe<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
those people maybe would look at it and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.999 
those people maybe would look at it and

coming<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.920> should<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> at

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
coming in you should do it at

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
coming in you should do it at
WrestleMania<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.539> him<00:02:09.720> help<00:02:09.840> the
