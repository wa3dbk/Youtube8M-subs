00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.630
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 teach how to make a few palmeritas 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 puff pastry good for making some palms 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.710
 of puff pastry 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.550
 we need granilla sugar also what 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.150
 you can make a dough with brown sugar 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.370
 of puff pastry 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.990
 and a roller is quite simple 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.520
 we have the sheet mass of the 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.550
 we have frozen it we have let it 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.370
 atempere 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.510
 and we have split it in this amount that 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.379
 it's going to be more than enough to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 illustrate how the process is done is this 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.629
 we take the sugar and we will go 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.629
 scattering 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.070
 above the puff pastry 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.530
 and let's help him to take it well 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.530
 just pressing a little 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.450
 with the idea of ​​the roller the following 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.450
 point let's go forward 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.830
 let's calculate 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.970
 and forward is quite important 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 here always look for the medium when 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.119
 let's make these folds that now 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.119
 discounted are the typical folds 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.980
 of the puff pastry dough when we make the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.290
 puff pastry and we are donating this would be the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.950
 simple fold it is one thing 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.159
 similar 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 and now the same process 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.719
 we put more sugar and with the help of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719
 roller 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.280
 and we will also introduce the roller 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.680
 here it comes in handy for 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.740
 that a puff pastry is firmly fixed next to 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.290
 another and then in the roasting process of 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.270
 baked does not take off and now what 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.270
 same we go to the middle 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 and now just a fold over 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.120
 the other 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 more sugar 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.010
 if you look at the cylinder that we have 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.170
 already formed would have the shape of the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.450
 palmerita us what we are going to do 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.849
 now it's going to be put a little on the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.340
 cold so that it takes more hardness and 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.900
 time to split it do not bend us towards 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.079
 side to side and lose the shape of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.250
 palm tree then just now what 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.190
 we passed 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.110
 to this dish we put it in the cold a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.750
 time and then when you have more 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.990
 hardness we will cut it and we will pass it to 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.990
 to bake 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.770
 well once we had it a little 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.050
 refrigerated so it was not soft 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.230
 what we are going to do is to start now 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.910
 the portions 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.910
 final is still still 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.680
 soft but not so soft as not 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.930
 to be able to leave we are going to take out some 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.650
 portions of a thickness of about three 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.650
 finger rooms 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.640
 we want now 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.640
 putting our baking tray 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.360
 and nothing just the same we separate them 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 well so that we do not have any 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.040
 problem when it comes to growing breasts 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.650
 in the area next to the others that we are going to 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.020
 bring to the oven 180 degrees about 20 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.330
 minutes 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.460
 well after 20 minutes this is 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.900
 the result of our palmeritas or 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.489
 puff pastry hearts and sugar 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.489
 we are going to put it here 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.540
 and well you could consume them like that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.450
 which could or could expose a coverage 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.530
 of chocolate for example the one that we have 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.840
 the chocolate sauce we have 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.519
 us in our online channel 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:26.669
 you can put cream jam 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.669
 the sweet that you like the most 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.129
 and well these are our palmeritas de 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.129
 puff pastry
