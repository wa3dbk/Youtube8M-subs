00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
got a taste of the bell centre crowd

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.920 
got a taste of the bell centre crowd
last<00:01:52.670> night<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.090> was<00:01:53.210> kind<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.600> friendly

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
last night but it was kind of a friendly

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.359 
last night but it was kind of a friendly
because<00:01:54.140> they're<00:01:54.320> all<00:01:54.440> teams<00:01:54.710> exactly

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
because they're all teams exactly

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.490 
because they're all teams exactly
exactly<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.840> certainly<00:01:57.110> different<00:01:57.320> to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
exactly I it's certainly different to

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.990 
exactly I it's certainly different to
have<00:01:57.650> another<00:01:58.040> team<00:01:58.340> coming<00:01:58.550> from<00:01:58.820> outside
