00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello girls then in this video that 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 the first of the virtus series with le 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.170
 I'll show those leggings outfits 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.150
 because if you're like me you're a little bit 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.320
 lazy in the morning you don't feel like 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 put me there to do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.150
 today details and put on the leggins 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 for you they are very comfortable and maybe if 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.940
 you have one thing but in the end i feel 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 a little the problem of what to combine 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 therefore I will be here of the garments that I like 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.129
 wear with leggins and I hope nothing 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.129
 so much that he likes them 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.309
 to one thing of course the style is one 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.860
 personal thing and i like them i'm sorry 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:59.910
 however I find that everyone has a priest 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 style that is different has spared others 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.540
 that was a very simple thing of 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.100
 areas such as law is a balloon if 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.579
 especially now that the round comes 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.130
 light sweater that blows second 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.110
 of the season 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.170
 by a simple touch to tweet 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.360
 very comfortable and warm this here and dish 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.720
 inside and I'll leave you useful limits 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.420
 minister box so if you are interested 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.729
 and networks more I really like 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.259
 wear c under a present shirt 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.220
 what of jeans and this too 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.920
 science and we have nothing I find that gives 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.080
 a little more is a bit more corato 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.039
 to smith but still very much 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.159
 comfortable and keeps warm and in fact 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.219
 I find it very good with leggins 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.219
 no 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.500
 like a lion with a deer it is absolutely 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 spend 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.310
 it's beautiful 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 according to oggi.it or in the soft 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.040
 simply the denim shirt and me 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.549
 like to give an extra touch with a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.519
 this belt here with vintage oil by 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.970
 my mom and I find it very well 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.860
 today very very simple, very comfortable 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 quick to use very much anyway 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.090
 comfortable and you can go here more 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.829
 adding adds of a belt 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.940
 colored for example the belt today 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.420
 fluo yellow 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.030
 these differences and therefore this is a 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.900
 rent very very simple and suitable for 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.900
 all 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.450
 follows 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.450
 here is this 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.610
 no 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.189
 you can give an extra touch by adding 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:13.189
 a leather jacket and this is always 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:14.870
 downhill and it's really great things here 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.629
 everything is studded there are also jackets 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.189
 much simpler skin though 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:24.709
 maybe inside and I really like it because 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:27.709
 becomes the center of the rent 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.590
 the third important let's say and I like it 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.480
 much like a sack in a denim shirt 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.480
 and this too is very very convenient 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.170
 see all the studs in front and 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:58.280
 also details on the sleeves without 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:59.930
 with boats but this athlete I wanted 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.989
 to focus attention right on 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.530
 strong point therefore always this one 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.230
 fantastic leather jacket and I wanted 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.300
 tell you that it is a combined today and accessories 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.519
 shoes because it's all in the boxes 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.109
 since we are still doing everything 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.450
 home and so anyway I wanted to 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.820
 simply showing treatable lag is 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.360
 if not one of the simplest videos that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.040
 I could do in the conditions that sound 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.250
 here for the analog this is a lot 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.820
 simple minimalist black t-shirt e 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 over this black leather jacket 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.680
 Yup 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.840
 already 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.240
 here I always got the same 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.150
 black t-shirt today.the jeans gate 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.919
 this game is really easy 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.110
 very very simple 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.870
 here there would be a very nice scarf 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.789
 necklace many accessories though you can of 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.110
 play play on this hole like that 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.940
 simple 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.750
 the denim shirt is always the same 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.120
 vision side and it is really very beautiful and or 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.919
 result the sleeves 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.919
 hogan, and what that read around 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:19.300
 for this it will be enough to remain charged cost 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:23.469
 he preferred to make this black shirt 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.780
 and this cardigan and become and is of 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.650
 this emerald green that I adore with 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.280
 black I really like this contrast is 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.460
 very soft that makes this effect a 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.439
 this very soft and very comfortable and me 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.960
 always like to add something 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:45.069
 because I am fond of shoes it is 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.710
 this one I will wear in this fit e 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:53.319
 of lafayette and taken to paris and note 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.000
 gray with all these flowers on 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.310
 shades of green I find it really 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.430
 this very well with this cardigan 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.050
 our very comfortable really very much 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.050
 comfortable is very simple 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.730
 and obviously what to keep 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.810
 the open cardigan if you prefer 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.810
 it depends on how we like it 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.700
 Yup 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.880
 goes out 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.880
 Yes No 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.120
 the latter at the pit and as for the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.800
 really want days simply in 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.430
 summer your favorite party has 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.600

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.420
 this is very convenient 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.950
 simple but 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.860
 if you want to make me see how 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.860

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.699
