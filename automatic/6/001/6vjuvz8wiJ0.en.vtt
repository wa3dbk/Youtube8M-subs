something new from you guys because I

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.390 
something new from you guys because I
know<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> was

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
know it was

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.009 
know it was
Orthodox<00:03:11.879> approach<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.420> putting<00:03:12.629> out<00:03:12.810> king

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
Orthodox approach to putting out king

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.630 
Orthodox approach to putting out king
alone<00:03:13.200> certainly<00:03:13.650> considering<00:03:14.099> how<00:03:14.310> everyone

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
alone certainly considering how everyone

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.300 
alone certainly considering how everyone
else<00:03:14.819> does<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.209> which<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.290> nothing<00:03:16.439> new<00:03:16.620> but

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
else does it which is nothing new but

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.559 
else does it which is nothing new but
you<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.670> guys<00:03:17.849> are<00:03:18.060> getting<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
yes sir I mean I we're really excited

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.179 
yes sir I mean I we're really excited
about<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.689> we<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.140> done<00:03:25.319> arenas<00:03:25.769> since

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
about this we have done arenas since

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.520 
about this we have done arenas since
we've<00:03:27.060> only<00:03:27.239> ever<00:03:27.629> played<00:03:27.870> arenas<00:03:28.290> once

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
we've only ever played arenas once

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.089 
we've only ever played arenas once
before<00:03:28.920> which<00:03:29.159> was<00:03:29.189> on<00:03:29.840> ok<00:03:30.840> computer<00:03:31.049> yeah<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
before which was on ok computer yeah and

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.920 
before which was on ok computer yeah and
I<00:03:32.189> think<00:03:32.459> because<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.909> kind<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
I think because of the kind of the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.380 
I think because of the kind of the
meteoric<00:03:34.409> rise<00:03:34.829> at<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.700> time<00:03:35.939> and<00:03:36.090> also

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
meteoric rise at the time and also

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.960 
meteoric rise at the time and also
probably<00:03:36.720> being<00:03:36.959> post<00:03:37.260> glass<00:03:37.590> 397<00:03:38.489> everything

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
probably being post glass 397 everything

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.720 
probably being post glass 397 everything
after<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.239> was<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.510> bit<00:03:39.689> of<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.900> blur<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.280> not

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
after that was a bit of a blur and not

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.089 
after that was a bit of a blur and not
that<00:03:41.909> much<00:03:42.090> fun<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.689> we're<00:03:43.680> actually<00:03:43.829> really

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
that much fun so we're actually really

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.309 
that much fun so we're actually really
excited<00:03:44.280> about<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.060> able<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.299> do<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:46.170> know

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
kind of emphasis are you placing on the

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.640 
kind of emphasis are you placing on the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
live shows it in rehearsals at this

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.170 
live shows it in rehearsals at this
point<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.579> much<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.939> choose<00:04:05.970> from

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
point you have so much to choose from

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.789 
point you have so much to choose from
but<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.599> king<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.870> looms<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.260> such<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.470> very

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
but the king of looms is such a very

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.830 
but the king of looms is such a very
direct<00:04:08.189> personal<00:04:08.730> sounding<00:04:09.120> record<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
direct personal sounding record and and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.750 
direct personal sounding record and and
and<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.590> how's<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.280> all<00:04:11.370> going<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.609> cut

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
and you know how's it all going to cut

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.339 
and you know how's it all going to cut
around<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.389> think<00:04:12.689> the<00:04:12.750> thing<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.139> that

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
around that I think the thing is that

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.289 
around that I think the thing is that
it's<00:04:13.500> got<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.829> be<00:04:13.950> creative<00:04:14.579> because<00:04:14.849> so<00:04:15.120> often

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
it's got to be creative because so often

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.939 
it's got to be creative because so often
when<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.750> when<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.019> go<00:04:16.289> on<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.590> road<00:04:16.739> it's

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
when you when you go on the road it's

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.319 
when you when you go on the road it's
kind<00:04:17.099> of<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.579> can<00:04:17.729> become<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
kind of like you can become like the

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.629 
kind of like you can become like the
jukebox<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.049> play<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> greatest<00:04:20.160> hits<00:04:20.370> we're

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
jukebox and play the greatest hits we're

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.009 
jukebox and play the greatest hits we're
not<00:04:20.760> going<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:20.970> do<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.120> we're<00:04:21.660> gonna<00:04:21.750> play

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
not going to do that we're gonna play

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.659 
not going to do that we're gonna play
the<00:04:22.169> songs<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.500> seem<00:04:22.800> up<00:04:22.949> for<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.220> show<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
the songs that seem up for the show and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.490 
the songs that seem up for the show and
I<00:04:23.820> think<00:04:24.090> we're<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.419> place<00:04:24.570> now<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.380> know<00:04:25.470> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I think we're in a place now you know I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.469 
I think we're in a place now you know I
think<00:04:25.650> there<00:04:25.979> will<00:04:26.490> definitely<00:04:26.699> be<00:04:26.909> old<00:04:27.120> songs

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
think there will definitely be old songs

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.390 
think there will definitely be old songs
but<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.110> doesn't<00:04:28.440> feel<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:28.949> have<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.130> play

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
but it doesn't feel like we have to play

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.460 
but it doesn't feel like we have to play
paranoid<00:04:29.880> android<00:04:30.240> yeah<00:04:30.510> yeah<00:04:30.960> well<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.320> guess

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
paranoid android yeah yeah well I guess

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.870 
paranoid android yeah yeah well I guess
in<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.680> way<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.949> they'll<00:04:32.099> feel<00:04:32.340> more<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.729> line

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
in a way that they'll feel more in line

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.430 
in a way that they'll feel more in line
with<00:04:32.909> King<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.389> Limbs<00:04:33.539> than<00:04:33.810> perhaps<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.320> know

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
with King of Limbs than perhaps you know
