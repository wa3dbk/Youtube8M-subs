valentine<00:00:22.340> we<00:00:23.340> begin<00:00:23.730> sketching<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.390> pencil

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
valentine we begin sketching with pencil

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.380 
valentine we begin sketching with pencil
what<00:00:25.140> will<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> rectangular<00:00:26.310> surface<00:00:28.039> Delta

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
what will be a rectangular surface Delta

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500 
what will be a rectangular surface Delta
the<00:00:30.390> sides<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.710> bottom<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:33.149> give<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the sides in the bottom and we give it

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
the sides in the bottom and we give it
the<00:00:33.540> thickness<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.160> much<00:00:37.280> on<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the thickness about this much on the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
the thickness about this much on the
second<00:00:38.910> thought<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
second thought I'm actually going to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
second thought I'm actually going to
change<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> I'll<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
change it I'll do it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
change it I'll do it
horizontal<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:43.980> better

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
horizontal I think it would look better

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.369 
horizontal I think it would look better
for<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.950> like<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
for this like that

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.889 
for this like that
we<00:00:49.010> go<00:00:49.250> over<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.820> lines<00:00:50.030> which<00:00:50.480> by<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.750> way

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
we go over the lines which by the way

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.200 
we go over the lines which by the way
you<00:00:51.379> can<00:00:51.620> do<00:00:51.800> them<00:00:51.980> with<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.190> ruler<00:00:52.579> if<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.969> want

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
you can do them with a ruler if you want

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.369 
you can do them with a ruler if you want
them<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.690> be<00:00:53.809> totally<00:00:54.289> straight<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:56.140> we<00:00:57.140> draw

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
them to be totally straight and we draw

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.279 
them to be totally straight and we draw
a<00:00:57.409> shadow<00:00:57.800> on<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.460> bottom<00:00:58.610> part<00:00:59.149> which<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.989> can

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
a shadow on the bottom part which we can

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.410 
a shadow on the bottom part which we can
then<00:01:00.399> smudge<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.000> Shema

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
then smudge with the Shema

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.010 
then smudge with the Shema
this<00:01:03.409> makes<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:03.980> look<00:01:04.009> smoother<00:01:04.840> with<00:01:05.840> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
this makes it look smoother with the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.930 
this makes it look smoother with the
eraser<00:01:06.259> we<00:01:06.649> clean<00:01:06.890> up<00:01:07.040> anything<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:07.729> will

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
eraser we clean up anything that will

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.889 
eraser we clean up anything that will
have<00:01:08.149> gone<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.200> top<00:01:09.619> area<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.460> then<00:01:11.240> with

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
have gone to the top area and then with

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.590 
have gone to the top area and then with
the<00:01:12.049> pencil<00:01:12.649> will<00:01:13.340> reinforce<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.090> shadow

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the pencil will reinforce the shadow

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.050 
the pencil will reinforce the shadow
especially<00:01:15.200> where<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.009> base<00:01:16.220> touches<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
especially where the base touches the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.099 
especially where the base touches the
surface<00:01:18.460> now<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:19.520> draw<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.030> sticks

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.029 

appear<00:01:24.109> will<00:01:24.439> be<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.890> hearts<00:01:26.560> we<00:01:27.560> give<00:01:27.829> them

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
appear will be the hearts we give them

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.459 
appear will be the hearts we give them
the<00:01:28.249> shape<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:28.819> ones<00:01:29.740> good<00:01:31.869> I'll<00:01:32.869> change<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
the shape we ones good I'll change the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.789 
the shape we ones good I'll change the
direction<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.219> sticks<00:01:34.840> slightly<00:01:35.840> not<00:01:36.560> so

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
direction of the sticks slightly not so

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.609 
direction of the sticks slightly not so
tilted<00:01:37.569> that<00:01:38.569> spur<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> red<00:01:41.600> marker<00:01:42.109> we<00:01:42.380> go

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
tilted that spur with a red marker we go

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.819 
tilted that spur with a red marker we go
around<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.369> borders<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.299> then<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:45.319> fill<00:01:45.590> them

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
around the borders and then we fill them

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.319 
around the borders and then we fill them
in<00:01:46.990> except<00:01:47.990> for<00:01:48.079> some<00:01:48.469> reflections<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.459> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
with a violet color pencil we'll start

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.460 
with a violet color pencil we'll start
making<00:02:01.780> some<00:02:02.350> texture<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
making some texture to the can the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.800 
making some texture to the can the
section<00:02:06.009> where<00:02:06.220> they<00:02:06.369> overlap<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.570> little

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
section where they overlap is a little

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.790 
section where they overlap is a little
bit<00:02:07.900> darker

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
bit darker

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
bit darker
with<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> violet<00:02:11.430> blue<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> borders

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
with a violet blue we can do the borders

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.470 
with a violet blue we can do the borders
and<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.680> parcel<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.400> want<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:15.000> more

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and the parcel we want to be more

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.520 
and the parcel we want to be more
contrasting<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:18.630> has<00:02:18.960> some<00:02:19.230> sort<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
contrasting it has some sort of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.610 
contrasting it has some sort of
imperfections<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.820> surface<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.930> with

imperfections on the surface and with
some<00:02:22.860> reflections<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.120> change<00:02:24.540> tone<00:02:25.760> with

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
some reflections that change tone with

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.570 
some reflections that change tone with
the<00:02:26.940> light<00:02:27.300> tones<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:28.110> amber<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.950> with

orange the shadows and the perspective

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.410 
orange the shadows and the perspective
of<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.660> base<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.770> make<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.190> hearts<00:02:35.610> stick<00:02:36.210> out

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
of the base we make the hearts stick out

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.830 
of the base we make the hearts stick out
in<00:02:36.690> 3d<00:02:37.820> we<00:02:38.820> smudge<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.540> give<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> some<00:02:40.470> color

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
in 3d we smudge and give it some color

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.620 
in 3d we smudge and give it some color
very<00:02:42.840> good<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> little<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.770> more<00:02:46.800> detail

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
very good we do a little bit more detail

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.510 
very good we do a little bit more detail
we<00:02:48.630> work<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.170> little<00:02:49.350> bit<00:02:49.590> more<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> texture
