00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.969
 the public is still there there is 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.469
 the mood the tension that goes up to the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 tension one is always serene and 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.850
 quiet I advocate a teammate 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.039
 I usually do not take the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.390
 head here it is true that since know 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.490
 his lawyers there are a lot of my 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.970
 training and it's great fun 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.769
 a few days of the big departure 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.910
 now we only think about it 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.859
 we can not wait to be there 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.070
 we can not wait to be there that's for sure 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.240
 we still have one of a last match I 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.239
 think we should we will make the beautiful game 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.350
 gave a victory to our fans because 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.760
 that's important he deserves 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.140
 they are not all present in brazil 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.879
 so try to make a good match 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.379
 of the beautiful show in the image that will be 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.910
 a good preparation for Algeria 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 it was a little bit the goal also more 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.019
 reunion with george leekens 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.340
 yeah find him with george leekens 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.809
 before us what is 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.760
 important that's how I said 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.149
 to make a good match and especially to 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.570
 stay in that positive spirit with a 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.370
 victory 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 the first game there will be very 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.910
 important algeria is hard we hear 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.890
 who make good preparation matches 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.570
 for now who are going to duel at 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 contact it's gonna be really already a 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.090
 crisis yeah that's a good team okay 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.550
 to be a tough match it will be a black 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.980
 well to get into this tournament 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.480
 and it's true that Algeria is a 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.640
 fairly aggressive team enough 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.050
 they also have players that is so 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.670
 it's going to be a tough match ago 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.630
 some tests in midfield for 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.640
 the moment because there are a lot of 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.690
 competitors for some positions but 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.920
 whatever the case may be 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.630
 you are always there always present 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.310
 as holder is really irremovable 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.990
 way now I do not know it's the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.790
 coach for the last game is going to do 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.290
 some changes up to as 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.190
 players who have not played much 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.470
 last match in sweden 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.060
 so we'll see Saturday and in what 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.460
 state you are you right now 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 quiet serene as usual would 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.300
 the rumors that swell around your 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.110
 future we are talking about and the last 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.000
 days 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.710
 impossible to come to Spain was not 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.659
 not even that yet but I am 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.920
 someone who is here I do not break 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.790
 the head in relation to that I concentrate 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.869
 on my world cup 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.400
 and then we'll see in training 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.569
 there are no big physical glitches 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 is what can really happen 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.800
 something wrong with this team 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.739
 in the end I touch wood not really 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.410
 all is well so 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.090
 as I said I touch wood to your 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.650
 future to you you still see yourself long 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.760
 term in russia because everyone 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
 said that you can in a championship 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.470
 more exposed is even more rated gecina 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 down 5 years and I still have a contract of 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 three years old i'm fine i say i'm 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.959
 focuses on my world cup and to 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.580
 nothing else with the Russians you have 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.650
 still a lot of talk about the second 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 match that awaits us I imagine pascal 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.680
 like someone from the zenith 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.000
 we get a little messed up learned the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.470
 the group and we will do everything to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.819
 win this game but hey I'm 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 confident in our team we have them 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.610
 qualities and 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.640
 on and on and run and you have to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.780
 be wary in this Russian team they have 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.000
 full of good players 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.240
 the end is always isolated in our 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.180
 castles the suroffre we know well 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.000
 that they grant the attacker so they 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.660
 have a good team style of play this is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.290
 what actually 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.520
 me it's Russian style is managed 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.010
 assaulted in duels and he likes fast 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.200
 played forward so we will have time 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.920
 to think about it also said that this is the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.110
 russia who will finish first in the group 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.460
 I do not agree with now 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.250
 we will do everything to finish first 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.810
 because it's important to voice there 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.440
 because in the group there will be 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.610
 Germany and Portugal so it will be 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.030
 that maybe but to meet the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.220
 Portugal 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.580
 I think Germany will bring you 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.580
 first
