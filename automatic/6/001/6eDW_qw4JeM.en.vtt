00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
like a true successor to the 2d sonic

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
actually a lot of green I find that kind

actually a lot of green I find that kind
of<00:01:04.250> weird

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
of weird

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.460 
of weird
if<00:01:04.789> you<00:01:05.270> actually<00:01:05.479> look<00:01:05.899> there's<00:01:06.110> actually<00:01:06.440> a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
if you actually look there's actually a

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.170 
if you actually look there's actually a
lot<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.800> fans<00:01:07.160> rather<00:01:07.549> than<00:01:07.909> anything

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
lot of fans rather than anything

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 
lot of fans rather than anything
actually<00:01:08.810> green<00:01:09.049> there's<00:01:09.320> not<00:01:09.439> any<00:01:09.619> graph

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
actually green there's not any graph

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.149 
actually green there's not any graph
there's<00:01:10.670> very<00:01:10.939> few<00:01:11.000> palm<00:01:11.479> trees<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.710> it's

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
there's very few palm trees but it's

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.649 
there's very few palm trees but it's
still<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:13.640> nice<00:01:13.850> you'll<00:01:14.030> notice<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:14.479> it's

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
still so nice you'll notice that it's

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.719 
still so nice you'll notice that it's
price<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.290> game<00:01:15.680> sprites<00:01:16.159> or<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.430> little

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
price is game sprites or a little

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.359 
price is game sprites or a little
difference<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.390> think<00:01:17.720> that's<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:18.470> like<00:01:18.770> Sega

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
difference I think that's just like Sega

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.660 
difference I think that's just like Sega
trying<00:01:19.640> something<00:01:19.939> new<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.270> don't<00:01:21.140> know<00:01:21.670> really

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
trying something new I don't know really

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.210 
trying something new I don't know really
want<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.210> make<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> bit<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.080> suppose<00:01:24.860> it's<00:01:25.130> a

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
want to make a bit but I suppose it's a

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.749 
want to make a bit but I suppose it's a
good<00:01:25.400> enough<00:01:25.610> change<00:01:25.970> really<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.460> here<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.580> go

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
good enough change really and here we go

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.460 
good enough change really and here we go
as<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.299> can<00:01:29.450> see<00:01:29.659> things<00:01:29.930> are<00:01:30.170> starting<00:01:30.439> to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
as you can see things are starting to

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.080 
as you can see things are starting to
look<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.710> little<00:01:30.860> more<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.549> green<00:01:31.790> hill

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
look a little more like the green hill

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.510 
look a little more like the green hill
like<00:01:32.689> that<00:01:32.960> marble<00:01:33.500> with<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
like that marble with all like the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.240 
like that marble with all like the
little<00:01:34.729> squares<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.420> not<00:01:35.659> really<00:01:35.990> sure<00:01:36.250> if

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
little squares are not really sure if

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.490 
little squares are not really sure if
that's<00:01:37.520> supposed<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.030> be<00:01:38.150> natural<00:01:38.360> I'm<00:01:39.229> not

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that's supposed to be natural I'm not

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.200 
that's supposed to be natural I'm not
really<00:01:39.650> sure<00:01:39.950> how<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.220> make<00:01:40.520> those<00:01:40.790> squares

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
really sure how you make those squares

here we go and this is lack GU it

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.679 
here we go and this is lack GU it
unlike<00:02:24.439> tonic<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.219> like<00:02:25.969> in<00:02:26.120> Sonic<00:02:26.329> Advance

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
unlike tonic one like in Sonic Advance

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.929 
unlike tonic one like in Sonic Advance
there<00:02:27.079> are<00:02:27.200> only<00:02:27.349> two<00:02:27.799> acts<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.549> their<00:02:28.700> boss

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
but it's okay if you probably bought

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.819 
but it's okay if you probably bought
this<00:02:32.299> when<00:02:32.629> it<00:02:32.750> came<00:02:32.989> out<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.469> Game<00:02:33.799> Boy

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
this when it came out on the Game Boy

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.390 
this when it came out on the Game Boy
Advance<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.719> 1999<00:02:35.719> and<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.200> was<00:02:37.069> kind<00:02:37.310> of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
Advance in 1999 and that was kind of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.819 
Advance in 1999 and that was kind of
cool<00:02:37.639> that<00:02:37.909> was<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.359> was<00:02:38.540> made<00:02:38.719> by<00:02:38.930> Sega<00:02:39.799> of

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
cool that was it was made by Sega of

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.339 
cool that was it was made by Sega of
Europe<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.989> yeah

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
Europe and yeah

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.080 
Europe and yeah
Sega's<00:02:42.799> they<00:02:42.980> kind<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.400> did<00:02:43.549> a<00:02:43.579> pretty<00:02:43.909> good

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
Sega's they kind of did a pretty good

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.509 
Sega's they kind of did a pretty good
job<00:02:44.150> at<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.719> Nintendo<00:02:45.349> they<00:02:45.709> licensed<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
job at it Nintendo they licensed the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.729 
job at it Nintendo they licensed the
game<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.629> think<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.169> good<00:02:48.439> first

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
game and I think it's a good first

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.619 
game and I think it's a good first
effort<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.430> haven't<00:02:49.790> played<00:02:49.969> the<00:02:50.150> other<00:02:50.299> games

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
effort I haven't played the other games

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.349 
effort I haven't played the other games
but<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.109> think<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:51.650> cool<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.219> I<00:02:52.879> think<00:02:52.939> if

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
but I think it's cool and I think if

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.330 
but I think it's cool and I think if
maybe<00:02:53.629> if<00:02:53.989> they<00:02:54.169> put<00:02:54.409> like<00:02:54.650> some<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.159> other

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
maybe if they put like some of the other

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.899 
maybe if they put like some of the other
characters<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.180> shadow<00:02:56.719> or<00:02:57.230> cream<00:02:57.650> or<00:02:58.069> maybe

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
characters like shadow or cream or maybe

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.030 
characters like shadow or cream or maybe
if<00:02:59.299> they<00:02:59.449> use<00:02:59.659> some<00:02:59.930> of<00:02:59.959> them<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.439> more<00:03:00.739> new

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
if they use some of them like more new

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.149 
if they use some of them like more new
characters<00:03:01.909> like<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.659> know<00:03:03.319> Phoenix<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
characters like I know Phoenix the
