00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 I will answer you questions on 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 about school and by the way I want to immediately 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 congratulate parents who kids went 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 in first class and and not at all in first 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 I have a class like my daughter 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 class for me this event congratulations 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 pupils you so let's start the first 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.100
 question which school did I graduate from and when 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 the daughter of the military therefore changed her life 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.340
 and 16 schools and probably the last years 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.590
 I changed high schools somewhere to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.440
 5 but the last class is 10 things i i 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 attended school 31 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.989
 She was in the city of Zaporozhye district 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 metallurgists but if this is someone to something 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 say the second question was how were you studying 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.240
 remarks on behavior I studied well 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 was a good girl 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.159
 I think that it still gave my moves 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.409
 keep changing schools catch up 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.360
 program get used to new learners and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 because of this i think suffered 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 my knowledge could be excellent 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 because I always liked to study 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 Well , I was like a good girl 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 such a dropout but closer to that were 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 there are no comments on behavior 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.630
 that the teachers think badly of me 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.050
 I really appreciated good attitude 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 myself teachers and I never 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 not hooligans but you can say so 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.630
 third question what teacher lesson loved 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 the most and why I still remember 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.770
 from this teacher I have it 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.170
 classmates friends from time to time 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.690
 or an old photo on me very 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.820
 liked it but I was afraid she was 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.130
 strict know taught me to read 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.790
 she probably didn't want that but on 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.530
 right teacher because love for 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 classic lobster khyam 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.830
 cats that is as she taught 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 Russian literature, I just, I loved 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.990
 these lessons I loved to write essays 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.020
 Love Alekseevna so brought the subject 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.210
 the lesson that he could not be not interested 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.060
 I also want to mention one teacher this 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.180
 physics geometry algebra and drafting then 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.640
 there is one teacher led all these subjects 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.080
 it was an adult and an adult man 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.300
 long past 60 but since he was telling 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.250
 especially physics I do not physics at all 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.670
 I understand, but it was interesting for me to listen 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.239
 because it was some kind of right little 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.209
 Do not experience and know such questions as a 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.450
 why do you need to open the lid when 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.550
 borscht cooked that's why write here 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.090
 me in the comments why it is necessary 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.910
 open 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.120
 the fourth question was whether the school 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.010
 nickname let's say so we all had 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.230
 friendly class and we did not hurt each other 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.840
 nickname mother per se was not all by 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.540
 each other’s names were sometimes called 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.719
 last names and my last name 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.209
 Shpovalova maiden and you have a boy 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:28.069
 bully such 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.849
 who tried my maiden name 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.010
 perry to distort and speak me a hat 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.760
 it did not like it and stopped it 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.459
 two weeks my nickname is help and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.069
 fell behind because I did not give the opportunity 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.560
 so I can't call myself 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.650
 say that the nickname was like that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.400
 probably a short time span of 2 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.269
 of the week 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.250
 I guess it was I was hoping 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.900
 fur 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 take that and tell a funny question 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.629
 stories from school actually 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.010
 There are a lot of funny stories but they are not 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.650
 touch me that is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.359
 remotely touch me okay little 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.189
 I'll tell you it was probably 7th grade and we 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.079
 girls naturally went to the toilet 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.139
 in groups well as now it happens 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.849
 And How 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.340
 from the girl already to the girl in the seventh 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:27.490
 classroom you turn round 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.490
 hair appears everywhere start to grow 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.740
 we became the shadow was the door that is 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.099
 the booths were without doors 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.620
 Well, we are as if not embarrassed by each other and 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:44.000
 one girl naturally i can't name 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.310
 call undressing and there already hair 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.760
 lot 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.830
 we were surprised it discussed discussed that 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.160
 it is in fact for us was 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.590
 very very cool she was so cool 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.540
 hair society where necessary 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.930
 the next day as a group in the toilet 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.040
 another girl is undressing and straight there 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.170
 very many but not real 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.630
 that is, she stuck them cut with 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.430
 dolls and glued to 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.000
 seem adult and the same 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.330
 steep 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.520
 of course we laughed we laughed 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.960
 but it was really funny then grade 7 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.530
 what is necessary to think so 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.870
 from a doll trim hair stick yourself 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.610
 there the sixth question was whether the school 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.930
 love 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.550
 I had no school love 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.290
 there was sympathy maybe some 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.770
 the boy liked more than anything else 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.470
 I've always liked the boys over here 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.190
 and in principle in my spouse given 10 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.720
 years older than me you can understand what 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.920
 school love as such wasn’t 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.130
 what fall in love with the teacher so next 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.450
 questions remain my friends from school 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.090
 such friends to be friends 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.280
 make friends no food like i have 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.920
 vkontakte we ask how are you friend 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.060
 friend sometime after school yes we still 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.680
 communicated met kafeshkam went 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.680
 but when families appeared and all the more 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.540
 I studied in Zaporozhye now I am in Kiev 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.960
 there are by the way my classmates who 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.960
 Kiev, too, there is a couple of times and met 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.760
 all that is, everyone has their own lives 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.930
 different interests therefore can't say 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.479
 that friends are left unfortunately 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.800
 the eighth question is what is learned in school 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.090
 it took you in life 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.919
 geography need history need algebra 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.800
 need to 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:45.620
 Russian language need spelling Russian 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.570
 literature is needed in general, everything was useful 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.630
 and all items are needed and here is blood 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.479
 sketching the ninth question last show 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.100
 at least 3 photos from school he have with this 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.160
 Of course I have a problem because 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.960
 there are no school photos as such 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.240
 maybe they are, I don't know, I'm going now 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.449
 ask to call mom asks can 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.789
 she must have something 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:11.210
 scan and I'll attach you at the end 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:14.509
 I want to wish you a good video 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.900
 Starting year for your children let you 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:20.690
 there will only be good marks if it is 12 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.660
 point system then of course 1211 is not 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.820
 and if less than the five-point Pyaterochka 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.120
 everybody have a good day and up to the new videos for now 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.120
