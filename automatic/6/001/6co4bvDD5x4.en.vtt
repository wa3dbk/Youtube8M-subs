00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 for bojan is the new antenna series 3 although the title is not yet final 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.490
 they tell us that its meaning will not be known until the last chapter 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.920
 this new project that still will not start rolling is one of the most 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.539
 ambitious of the chain the scenarios that will be between Colombia and Madrid and 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.570
 its plot revolves around the disappearance of a young hugo silva 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.240
 it will be the storm character that goes in his quest for this task will be 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 accompanied by marta grandson among the cast of actors sneak three new 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 faces nazaret aracil luciano blacksmith and marta wars if he brought it from del 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.260
 project can be 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.810
 the panel starts the script 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.420
 I think he's a very powerful guy written with 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 very much rhythm 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.180
 and then good apart because the character is not a character that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.350
 I wanted a lot of work a character had bad faith I think it's a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.700
 there was never a very 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.320
 very powerful and then also grants to make a senate meter dante tuning 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.180
 with other resources a high executive percent has a very different dynamic 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.620
 to mine anyone who has done wolf also this is very nice 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.160
 to tel 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 let's say he the goal of the character that is the redemption 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.850
 very very beautiful fact and that it is valued very little llorente 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.790
 in synthesis of DNA to create it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 by the way essentially where yes I have some 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 or that some 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.580
 2 references that I prefer not to say g 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 Peru 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.210
 role but let's go what I've worked the most has been 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 solÃ¡ to the psychology of the essential character humble people who do not have 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.940
 does not have an hour either 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.260
 a very complicated composition 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.700
 more is more powerful what happens to the character the situation in which 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.440
 go involved 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 what any other step 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.290
 in the part that force that took place by 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.780
 We felt that this is a pretty idealistic character 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.950
 i but that ingredient affected is a character that falls gold 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 yes because they have less than 2 700 weapon that has dedicate to others 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.570
 belong as if the boss was continuously not 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 Then he found out, but of course, the objective he has of what he has 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.149
 under 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.969
 it is a very strong pain is not what makes it work so that is different not 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.699
 has nothing to do, let's not say that the murders can not do more 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.529
 media 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.419
 in fact so far but but after what you have done many others more 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.009
 very different you call me what I like is 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.739
 make different characters for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.159
 to enjoy and discover new things 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.379
 baleares the television to do a project that does not overcome that has 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.609
 final 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.719
 So I do not think so 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.709
 for now, not how your character has worked 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.199
 Well, I'm working 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.199
 I went how I felt back 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.309
 basically where your drivers come from where your engine comes from 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.849
 that dies because this of having the isps banished from one more perspective 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:54.469
 clear 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.469
 where does it start and where does it end 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.009
 nestle women with 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.989
 ain with character 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.269
 it would be possible 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.999
 but it is very professional then the feeling of justice has it as 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.919
 very clear 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.959
 then he would arrive with salgado and 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.549
 read natera to italy but 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.539
 but for the country 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.539
 You could say that he has something of you 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.989
 has something has something but general percent in appearance 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.259
 although in a way to be 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.359
 has things will be more national ms national than him 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:37.259
 and it's much more impetus impulse mmm 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.019
 is this one from whom the motor of the viscera is 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.629
 I like your character love my character let's start 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.189
 mann the jazz 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.109
 I wanted to be full 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.579
 well, you should dedicate yourself 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.459
 is the typical girl of the age who is a bit crazy for all those 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.750
 units like the one that more than half and this the funniest the craziest 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:06.059
 but that in the long run gives him a good turn when he finds out that his best friend 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.419
 friend disappeared this character of Mary is a character 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.409
 the strong and not because he stoner adults families who find things that 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.669
 not even where you can get to imagine what can happen to her 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.239
 well my character is not interested is to have complicated because 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:28.679
 is very strong do not end in twenty years suffer all this world that is 

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:29.930
 comes over 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.460
 but I think it's very interesting and above all I think that management does not grow
