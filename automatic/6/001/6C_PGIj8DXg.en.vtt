00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
going to the South San Diego I have a

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.130 
going to the South San Diego I have a
lot<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.039> salt<00:00:48.339> water<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.989> we're

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
lot of salt water and so we're

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.079 
lot of salt water and so we're
struggling<00:00:50.559> with<00:00:50.890> getting<00:00:51.550> all<00:00:51.760> everything

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
struggling with getting all everything

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.340 
struggling with getting all everything
put<00:00:52.239> together<00:00:52.329> with<00:00:52.750> all<00:00:52.899> that<00:00:53.079> salt

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
put together with all that salt

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.430 
put together with all that salt
corrosion<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:54.780> we'd<00:00:55.780> put<00:00:55.929> installed<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.350> new

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
corrosion and we'd put installed a new

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.750 
corrosion and we'd put installed a new
front<00:00:56.710> where<00:00:56.859> ain't<00:00:57.010> wing<00:00:57.159> and<00:00:57.369> San<00:00:57.519> Diego

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
front where ain't wing and San Diego

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.259 
front where ain't wing and San Diego
that<00:00:57.789> we<00:00:57.969> didn't<00:00:58.570> get<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.750> chance<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.170> test<00:00:59.530> and

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
that we didn't get a chance to test and

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.700 
that we didn't get a chance to test and
so<00:01:01.269> we've<00:01:01.750> only<00:01:01.899> been<00:01:02.049> on<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.199> water<00:01:02.350> once

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
so we've only been on the water once

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.460 
so we've only been on the water once

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
boat out there we're just not carrying

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.249 
boat out there we're just not carrying
the<00:01:21.850> speed<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:22.240> down<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.810> hole<00:01:23.049> straight

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
the speed down down the hole straight

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.590 
the speed down down the hole straight
away<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.530> through<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.039> turn<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.479> know<00:01:25.569> I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
think a little bit way more wing

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.039 
think a little bit way more wing
adjustment<00:01:28.060> hopefully<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.720> get<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.020> that

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
adjustment hopefully we get it to that

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.960 
adjustment hopefully we get it to that
turn<00:01:29.319> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:29.500> bit<00:01:29.679> better<00:01:29.860> maybe<00:01:30.190> get<00:01:30.940> a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
turn a little bit better maybe get a

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.190
