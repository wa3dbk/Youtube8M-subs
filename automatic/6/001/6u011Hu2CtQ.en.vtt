range hood is going to insert up inside

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
range hood is going to insert up inside
of<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.610> hidden<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.150> the

copper enclosure or the wooden enclosure

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.550 
copper enclosure or the wooden enclosure
and<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.690> mount<00:00:21.870> inside<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and this is going to mount inside of it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.020 
and this is going to mount inside of it
and<00:00:22.620> you'll<00:00:23.160> only<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.520> able<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.700> see<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> from

between<00:00:35.219> those<00:00:35.340> sizes<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.360> number<00:00:36.629> of

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:36.659 
between those sizes is the number of

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.869 
between those sizes is the number of
baffle<00:00:37.140> filters<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.710> lights<00:00:37.920> increases<00:00:38.730> as

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the size increases but what does not

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.750 
the size increases but what does not
change<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:41.999> depth<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> height<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
change is the depth and the height that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
change is the depth and the height that
