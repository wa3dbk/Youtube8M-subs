00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
now I'm just using a light fertilizer

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:27.500 
now I'm just using a light fertilizer
every<00:05:03.540> 4<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.570> 5<00:05:04.840> weeks

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:40.070 

simple<00:05:28.170> noises

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.030 

hope<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.889> enjoyed<00:05:41.340> it

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.140 

I'll<00:05:46.370> probably<00:05:48.130> clean<00:05:49.130> this<00:05:49.160> up<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:49.760> cut<00:05:50.030> it

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
I'll probably clean this up and cut it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.120 
I'll probably clean this up and cut it
back<00:05:50.180> heavily<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.170> then<00:05:51.290> let<00:05:51.410> it<00:05:51.440> regrow<00:05:51.950> out

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
back heavily and then let it regrow out

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.760 
back heavily and then let it regrow out
again<00:05:52.460> in<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:52.790> few<00:05:52.970> weeks<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.480> maybe<00:05:54.410> we<00:05:54.620> can

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
again in a few weeks and maybe we can

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.380 
again in a few weeks and maybe we can
see<00:05:54.950> more<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.280> these<00:05:55.370> unusual<00:05:55.880> plants<00:05:56.270> that

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
see more of these unusual plants that
