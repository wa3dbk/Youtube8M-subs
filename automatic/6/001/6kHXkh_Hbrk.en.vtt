00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
fabric and your foot comes up that's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
fabric and your foot comes up that's
correct<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.290> come<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:25.830> area<00:01:26.189> where<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
correct as I come to an area where I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
correct as I come to an area where I
have<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.970> pivot<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.600> stop<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.939> foot

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
have to pivot I stop and my foot

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.780 
have to pivot I stop and my foot
automatically<00:01:31.049> raises<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.670> do

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
automatically raises so that I can do

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.120 
automatically raises so that I can do
the<00:01:32.939> next<00:01:33.180> stitch<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.020> stop<00:01:34.320> again<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the next stitch and if I stop again the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
the next stitch and if I stop again the
foot<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.579> raise<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:37.979> less<00:01:38.189> thing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
foot will raise so that's one less thing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.499 
foot will raise so that's one less thing
you<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.909> about<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.329> you're

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you have to think about when you're

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.819 
you have to think about when you're
trying<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> maneuver<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.350> those<00:01:40.560> shapes

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
trying to maneuver all those shapes

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.730 
trying to maneuver all those shapes
that's<00:01:41.250> correct<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> whenever<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> stop<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's correct so whenever I stop the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's correct so whenever I stop the
foot<00:01:43.979> automatically<00:01:44.820> raises<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
foot automatically raises and when you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.679 
foot automatically raises and when you
start<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.619> goes<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.100> again<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:48.000> correct

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
start it goes down again that's correct

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
start it goes down again that's correct
and<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> areas<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:50.670> need

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and so for the areas where I don't need

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.679 
and so for the areas where I don't need
to<00:01:51.869> raise<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.680> foot<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.460> speed<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to raise the foot I can speed up and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.580 
to raise the foot I can speed up and
then<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> come<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> corner<00:01:57.140> when<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> stop

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
then as I come to a corner when I stop

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
then as I come to a corner when I stop
the<00:01:59.159> foot<00:01:59.369> raises

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.899 

so<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> can<00:02:03.280> actually<00:02:03.729> do<00:02:04.299> individual<00:02:05.109> stitches

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
so I can actually do individual stitches
