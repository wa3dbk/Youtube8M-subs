00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.130 
up here I'm going to use the same piece
of<00:01:12.159> wood<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.210> can<00:01:13.390> get<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.690> grain<00:01:13.960> to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
of wood so that I can get the grain to

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.470 
of wood so that I can get the grain to
match<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.740> top<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.430> body<00:01:15.670> which

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
match on the top and the body which

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.140 
match on the top and the body which
pretty<00:01:16.750> much<00:01:16.840> makes<00:01:17.230> sense<00:01:17.590> here<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.540> anyway

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
