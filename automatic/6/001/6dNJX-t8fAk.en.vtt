00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.540
 Fruit 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.719
 Juan loved it, I marveled at an end of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.599
 life I'm more prone to salty 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 but that cake is one for this and one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.140
 When traveling, open heads of hearts 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.510
 this is a reinterpretation of a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 dulce de leche and meringue cake but 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.599
 the clear ap the meringue meringue is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 the last one we did 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 in fact we send a giant kiss to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 variable that we are recovering 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.530
 a giant operation that before the great 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.290
 air pastry I love how you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.260
 this one is not fundamentalist and in the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.079
 hand of a recipe and everything else one thing 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700
 that I respect respect for all 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 things did not promise us to salt because it 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.140
 he asked for it he has said meanwhile 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 I'll quickly go I'll mix the recipe 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.610
 today is how the other one of a recipe said 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.730
 It has not very difficult that you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.640
 really find a recipe so 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.350
 is registered by some when a 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.430
 color was a cake was a baker a 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.400
 Gastronomic performs one of these works 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.540
 that are absolutely fast in the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.740
 concept of work and liliana the best that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.240
 It can happen to everyone of 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.330
 Argentines and of course we are 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 naming variable because that 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.810
 that's what we're going to do 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 delighted to really be 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.880
 can not now is very well very rich 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.219
 thank you very much we listened 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.219
 because he had to me and me 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.659
 thanks to the grace for the question 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.549
 We put 100 butter and 80 sugar 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.610
 well blandita butter we beat a little 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.259
 now the sugar fusion the shake a bit 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.510
 you have to whiten a little bit more I'm going to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.120
 put two seeds 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.390
 we are the world egg week 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.840
 so how are we going to be this week? 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.090
 in there 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.599
 mix all this well and I just need 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.750
 add the dry part if we wanted or 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.989
 we would like well said we can put 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.239
 Here is a tapa, two tapas of essence of 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.530
 Vanilla stuck to have dulce de leche and 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.530
 will have meringue 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.130
 because also the shortest a little 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 then that goes with this for 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.770
 prepare the meringue and this would come to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 be for the base for the mass this 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.050
 it would be for the base I will run 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.910
 I love the ribbon a little bit 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.880
 thanks to this dust where by then 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:10.040
 250 grams of flour 40 accord as 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:12.500
 new feels sugar 80 butter and 250 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.420
 of flour 40 but I'm going to put a 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.940
 little bit of baking powder there is a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190
 teaspoon saladita mixed it well for 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.810
 that is well distributed is already sifted 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.090
 this flour and it's going to stabilize a couple 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.980
 of times better still and directly 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.750
 We are imposing here if we need to 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.550
 add a little milk about 4 or 5 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.600
 power scoops 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.140
 may need never but after 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.140
 everything and as it is in a broken mass 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.890
 what's left super is very very very 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.350
 tranquilita very soft crispy and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.010
 neutral because I have so much so much 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.220
 sugar because as we just said 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.220
 equals with meringue 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.250
 which is that the museum of everything 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.810
 the simplest we take it is already 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.290
 because you have to send it to the cold and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.460
 you are only taking the milk that 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.470
 I just put in a good jet 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.880
 said more or less 5 tablespoons goes to 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.770
 serve to finish taking here 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.370
 take not I'm not going to happen I just want to 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.470
 take take it clarified that I'll take if you love 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.540
 to develop lucen you have more than 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.540
 crispy you have left during the week 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.300
 this type of mass can be stepped on and the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.300
 heart 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.900
 and do not give too much work of all 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.450
 ways I have to remind you of the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.670
