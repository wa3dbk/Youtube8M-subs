00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.020
 preparation f6 for operation 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.960
 before the first launch of the membrane 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.509
 need to soak for this pour 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 into a camera container 40 45 degrees and 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.949
 fingers about the heroine imran so 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 must be repeated six more seven times 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.760
 every 10 min after 8 wiping 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.250
 I will need to merge the first run 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.860
 pour hummer cold water from the well 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.649
 wells and tap water ticket 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 so that the side camera 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.690
 water level was needed three centimeters 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 lower than similar 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 cover and plug in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 after the first two starts wisely 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 it is advisable to follow the device goes to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 stable operation after 7 9 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 start the process of preparing catholyte and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.710
 anolyte live and dead water fill 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.890
 the apparatus into the chamber of water by 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.900
 plastic septum while you and candu 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.799
 the cathode chamber is poured onto 23 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.830
 centimeter lower 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.270
 water can be taken from a well tap 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.939
 somewhere or well the colder the original 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.210
 water is stronger analytics tariff 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.590
 is obtained at the output depending on 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 initial water parameters 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.600
 cooking time can last from 30 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.009
 minutes to an hour and a half 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 cooked mudras desirable to keep 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.439
 secret for this we recommend 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.710
 use these 3 liter jars 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.680
 merge about will be desirable to merge 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 immediately after preparation after 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:54.840
 processing we actually water jars with cats 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.440
 Someone from it is there as transparent 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.870
 clean rolls 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.110
 after cooking which 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.420
 in order to clear it from here 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.020
 need to wait 20 to 40 minutes for 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.080
 this time 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.210
 commissions will be lasso on to 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.590
 speed up this process will be necessary 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.830
 stir to get drinking water 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.230
 take a three-liter jar 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.260
 merge not his clean rolled rolled with 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.840
 sediment drain the monolith pour 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.210
 with long you three times niches farther you 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.400
 you will try protoss and we get 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.250
 clean drinking water enriched cream 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 him and possessing healing properties 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.340
 delights can vary significantly if 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.460
 she add it more or less 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.160
 experiment 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.860
 select the ratio of catholyte and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.290
 anolyte so that the water you like love 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 was pleasant and beat Peter on health 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.380
