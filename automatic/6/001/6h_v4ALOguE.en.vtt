00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
connection when you get to the edge of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.930 
connection when you get to the edge of
the<00:00:31.170> screen<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.769> starts<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> pan<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.850> you'll

this is great when you want to make a
really<00:00:37.530> long<00:00:37.710> connection<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> want<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
really long connection and you want to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.510 
really long connection and you want to
kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.270> overview<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:39.930> patch<00:00:40.520> so

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
kind of see an overview of your patch so

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
kind of see an overview of your patch so
it'll<00:00:41.730> zoom<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:44.070> it's

it'll zoom out but when it's when it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.330 
it'll zoom out but when it's when it's
no<00:00:44.399> longer<00:00:44.690> scrolling<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.140> zooms<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
no longer scrolling it zooms back in so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
no longer scrolling it zooms back in so
when<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.640> honing<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> connection

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
when you're honing in on that connection

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
when you're honing in on that connection
that<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.750> it'll<00:00:51.750> soon<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.140> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that you want to make it'll soon back in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.279 
that you want to make it'll soon back in
to<00:00:52.500> make<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> easier<00:00:53.870> now<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> last<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.140> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
to make it easier now the last thing I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
to make it easier now the last thing I
want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> show<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> iphone<00:00:56.460> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
want to show you is that the iphone can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
want to show you is that the iphone can
run<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.360> sophisticated<00:00:57.750> patches<00:00:58.530> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
run really sophisticated patches so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.080 
run really sophisticated patches so
here's<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.789> complicated

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
here's one of the more complicated

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.349 
here's one of the more complicated
patches<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> comes<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.590> jealous<00:01:02.359> there

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
patches that comes with a jealous there

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.170 
patches that comes with a jealous there
we<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:04.519> I'll<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.909> while<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> load

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
we go I'll take a little while to load

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960 
we go I'll take a little while to load
and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.700 

this<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> really<00:01:13.570> complicated<00:01:13.900> patch

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.190 

as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.370> can<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.850> start<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
as you can kind of start to see you can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.340 
as you can kind of start to see you can
see<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.470> sequent<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.840> switches

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
see all the sequent the the switches

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.450 
see all the sequent the the switches
going<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.520> real<00:01:23.700> playing<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> sequence

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.620 

it<00:01:30.120> has<00:01:30.270> multiple<00:01:30.570> custom-built<00:01:31.350> nodes<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
it has multiple custom-built nodes and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.350 
it has multiple custom-built nodes and
its<00:01:33.630> CPU<00:01:33.930> load<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> iphone<00:01:34.830> 5s<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.909> only

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
its CPU load on this iphone 5s is only

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.160 
its CPU load on this iphone 5s is only
point<00:01:36.750> 09<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.940> could<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.720> patch<00:01:39.960> that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
point 09 so you could have a patch that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
point 09 so you could have a patch that
several<00:01:40.530> times<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.979> complicated<00:01:41.520> than<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
several times more complicated than this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
several times more complicated than this
and<00:01:42.119> still<00:01:42.900> run<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.440> iPhone<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and still run it on your iPhone and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.320 
and still run it on your iPhone and
that's<00:01:44.310> pretty<00:01:44.520> awesome<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.909> ajah<00:01:48.060> list

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
that's pretty awesome so with ajah list

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.120 
that's pretty awesome so with ajah list
for<00:01:48.450> iphone<00:01:48.780> you've<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> most<00:01:49.680> powerful

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
for iphone you've got the most powerful
