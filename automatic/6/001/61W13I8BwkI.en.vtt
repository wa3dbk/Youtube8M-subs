00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
automatically so next in line was a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.240 
automatically so next in line was a
wheelie<00:02:55.810> contest<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.500> combined<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
wheelie contest that combined going the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280 
wheelie contest that combined going the
distance<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.880> doing<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.540> with<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.900> slowest

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
distance and doing it with the slowest

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.470 
distance and doing it with the slowest
time<00:02:59.400> some<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.430> these<00:03:00.610> guys<00:03:00.880> seem<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.360> be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
time some of these guys seem to be

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:20.910 
time some of these guys seem to be
aiming<00:03:01.720> right<00:03:02.080> at<00:03:02.140> our<00:03:02.380> camera<00:03:02.650> crew

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.500 

then<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.100> warm-up<00:03:22.520> for<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.760> main<00:03:22.850> mud<00:03:23.240> event

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
then as a warm-up for the main mud event

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.420 
then as a warm-up for the main mud event
there<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:23.870> an<00:03:24.020> obstacle<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.710> ended<00:03:25.250> with

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
there was an obstacle that ended with

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.420 
there was an obstacle that ended with
you<00:03:25.880> guessed<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.330> but<00:03:26.750> some<00:03:27.650> riders<00:03:27.890> had<00:03:28.190> more

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
you guessed it but some riders had more

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:43.790 
you guessed it but some riders had more
grace<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> course<00:03:29.240> than<00:03:29.510> others

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.530 

but<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.950> biggest<00:03:45.160> reason<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:46.000> event<00:03:46.300> is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
but the biggest reason for this event is

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.930 
but the biggest reason for this event is
mud<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.440> finale<00:03:47.800> event<00:03:48.040> had<00:03:48.490> lots<00:03:48.790> of
