00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
nice case incipio foot out it's got a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.320 
nice case incipio foot out it's got a
two<00:00:16.789> layer<00:00:17.000> case<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:20.150> insides<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.869> silicon

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
two layer case the insides a silicon

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.120 
two layer case the insides a silicon
layer<00:00:23.920> also<00:00:24.920> has<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.279> plastic<00:00:26.019> outside<00:00:27.130> it's

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
layer also has a plastic outside it's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.490 
layer also has a plastic outside it's
what<00:00:29.060> they<00:00:29.179> call<00:00:29.210> Plex<00:00:29.630> tonian<00:00:30.080> but<00:00:30.199> it's<00:00:30.320> hard

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
what they call Plex tonian but it's hard

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.400 
what they call Plex tonian but it's hard
plastic<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:31.250> got<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.429> shiny<00:00:31.699> metallic<00:00:32.410> look

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
plastic it's got a shiny metallic look

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.290 
plastic it's got a shiny metallic look
to<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:33.850> which<00:00:34.930> which<00:00:35.930> has<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.530> nice<00:00:36.860> finish<00:00:37.400> very

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
to it which which has a nice finish very

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.710 
to it which which has a nice finish very
nice<00:00:38.510> finish<00:00:38.870> once<00:00:39.380> you<00:00:39.500> put<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.770> together

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
nice finish once you put it together

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.600 
nice finish once you put it together
alright<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.920> I'll<00:00:43.010> show<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.220> how<00:00:43.310> it<00:00:43.460> goes

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
alright so I'll show you how it goes

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:59.520 
alright so I'll show you how it goes
goes<00:00:44.180> on<00:00:51.370> silicon<00:00:52.370> goes<00:00:52.580> around<00:00:52.790> real<00:00:53.090> easy

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.229 

now<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.680> does<00:01:00.830> go<00:01:01.070> on<00:01:01.930> very<00:01:02.930> nicely<00:01:03.200> however

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
now it does go on very nicely however

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.080 
now it does go on very nicely however
the<00:01:05.239> silicon<00:01:06.020> inside<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:06.619> have<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:08.000> have

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
the silicon inside you have to you have

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.399 
the silicon inside you have to you have
to<00:01:08.210> work<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.600> edges<00:01:08.899> around<00:01:09.049> especially

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
to work the edges around especially

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.149 
to work the edges around especially
around<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:09.950> logo<00:01:10.310> here

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.870 

once<00:01:18.159> everything's<00:01:18.579> snapped<00:01:19.299> into<00:01:19.509> place

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
once everything's snapped into place

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.279 
once everything's snapped into place
looks<00:01:21.880> really<00:01:22.210> good<00:01:22.329> has<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.600> good<00:01:22.840> lay<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.079> the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
looks really good has a good lay on the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.480 
looks really good has a good lay on the
table<00:01:23.320> design<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:26.200> covered<00:01:26.770> covered

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
table design so it's covered covered

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.410 
table design so it's covered covered
there<00:01:27.789> all<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> ports<00:01:28.600> are<00:01:29.579> accessible<00:01:30.579> the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
there all the ports are accessible the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.870 
there all the ports are accessible the
different<00:01:31.750> noise<00:01:32.679> cancellation<00:01:33.429> mics<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
different noise cancellation mics on the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.730 
different noise cancellation mics on the
front<00:01:34.210> back<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.659> have<00:01:37.959> coverage<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.619> edge

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
front back you have coverage on the edge

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380 
front back you have coverage on the edge
but<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.100> doesn't<00:01:39.340> take<00:01:39.490> doesn't<00:01:40.090> take<00:01:40.149> too

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
but it doesn't take doesn't take too

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.679 
but it doesn't take doesn't take too
much<00:01:40.679> damage<00:01:41.679> wise<00:01:42.459> I<00:01:42.939> wouldn't<00:01:43.450> feel

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
much damage wise I wouldn't feel

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.850 
much damage wise I wouldn't feel
wouldn't<00:01:46.689> feel<00:01:46.810> bad<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.229> drop<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:48.759> all

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
wouldn't feel bad to drop this at all

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.550 
wouldn't feel bad to drop this at all
now<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.920> do<00:01:51.250> lose<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:52.299> do<00:01:52.450> lose<00:01:52.689> sort<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.409> one

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
now you do lose you do lose sort of one

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.399 
now you do lose you do lose sort of one
of<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> key<00:01:54.579> features<00:01:54.819> of<00:01:55.060> moto<00:01:55.390> x<00:01:55.659> had<00:01:55.989> which

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
of the key features of moto x had which

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.969 
of the key features of moto x had which
is<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:57.789> moto<00:01:58.000> maker<00:01:58.179> so<00:01:58.569> most<00:01:58.840> most<00:01:59.679> people

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
is the moto maker so most most people

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.309 
is the moto maker so most most people
design<00:02:00.369> their<00:02:00.549> own<00:02:00.579> phones<00:02:00.959> you<00:02:01.959> know<00:02:02.079> outside

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
design their own phones you know outside

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.889 
design their own phones you know outside
of<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.099> ring<00:02:03.789> on<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.030> back<00:02:04.239> here<00:02:04.270> you're

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
of the ring on the back here you're

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.050 
of the ring on the back here you're
going<00:02:04.989> to<00:02:05.110> lose<00:02:05.229> most<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.009> most<00:02:06.849> of<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
going to lose most of the most of the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.529 
going to lose most of the most of the
design<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.599> you<00:02:07.689> have<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.819> most<00:02:09.819> people<00:02:10.000> may

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
design that you have so most people may

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.900 
design that you have so most people may
not<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:11.260> however<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.370> do<00:02:12.610> get<00:02:12.880> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
not like that however you do get a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.050 
not like that however you do get a
really<00:02:13.450> nice<00:02:13.769> really<00:02:14.769> nice<00:02:15.010> metallic<00:02:15.459> look<00:02:15.910> on

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
really nice really nice metallic look on

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.229 
really nice really nice metallic look on
the<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.329> so<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.650> might<00:02:17.890> might<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.879> an<00:02:18.970> added

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
the back so you might might be an added

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.580 
the back so you might might be an added
feature<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.870> depends<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.440> you're

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
feature so it depends on what you're

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.620 
feature so it depends on what you're
looking<00:02:20.620> for<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.430> don't<00:02:25.269> thing<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.569> I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
looking for the don't thing that I

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
looking for the don't thing that I
notice<00:02:25.930> after<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:26.440> bit<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> use<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.310> does

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
notice after a little bit of use it does

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.569 
notice after a little bit of use it does
it<00:02:27.700> does<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:29.319> some<00:02:29.560> scratches<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
it does get some scratches so the

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.849 
it does get some scratches so the
metallic<00:02:30.970> looks<00:02:31.209> really<00:02:31.510> nice<00:02:31.709> however<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
metallic looks really nice however you

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.379 
metallic looks really nice however you
are<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.310> some<00:02:33.489> scratches<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.180> there

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
are going to get some scratches on there

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.090 
are going to get some scratches on there
so<00:02:34.600> after<00:02:34.900> time<00:02:35.139> it's<00:02:35.650> going<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:35.889> get<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> little

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
so after time it's going to get a little

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.520 
so after time it's going to get a little
bit<00:02:36.310> warm<00:02:36.900> alright<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.109> little<00:02:38.410> bit<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
bit warm alright with a little bit of

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.520 
bit warm alright with a little bit of
heavy<00:02:38.709> use<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.950> its<00:02:39.310> your<00:02:39.489> daily<00:02:39.910> case<00:02:40.530> maybe

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
heavy use of its your daily case maybe

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.160 
heavy use of its your daily case maybe
if<00:02:41.739> it's<00:02:41.920> maybe<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.030> switch<00:02:43.239> cases<00:02:43.510> off<00:02:43.870> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
if it's maybe just switch cases off a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.250
