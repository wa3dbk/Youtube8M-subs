big one debate that you lost to get

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.469 
big one debate that you lost to get
another<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.299> stuff

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
another one you got to put that stuff

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.730 
another one you got to put that stuff
out<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.840> mind<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.260> hard<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.560> people

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
out of your mind that's hard for people

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
out of your mind that's hard for people
to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.909> lot<00:01:12.030> easier<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> say<00:01:12.689> than<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
to do it's a lot easier to say than it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.160 

yeah<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.770> technology<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.670> good<00:01:21.880> now<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
yeah the technology is so good now that

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.390 
yeah the technology is so good now that
if<00:01:23.320> you're<00:01:23.440> not<00:01:23.500> careful<00:01:23.590> it'll<00:01:24.130> make<00:01:24.280> you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
if you're not careful it'll make you

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.219 
if you're not careful it'll make you
lazy<00:01:24.690> you<00:01:25.690> know<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.900> mean<00:01:26.729> GPS<00:01:27.729> mapping<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.990> you

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
lazy you know I mean GPS mapping and you

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.290 
lazy you know I mean GPS mapping and you
know<00:01:29.320> people<00:01:29.680> just<00:01:29.710> oh<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.400> know<00:01:30.790> how<00:01:30.970> shoot<00:01:31.180> I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
know people just oh you know how shoot I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.910 
know people just oh you know how shoot I
don't<00:01:31.360> need<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.780> buy<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> map<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.410> don't<00:01:32.590> need<00:01:32.740> to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
don't need to buy a map I don't need to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.560 
don't need to buy a map I don't need to
really<00:01:33.520> look<00:01:33.640> at<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> map<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.210> can<00:01:34.240> see

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
really look at a map I can see

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.630 
really look at a map I can see
everything<00:01:34.930> that's<00:01:35.140> out<00:01:35.860> there<00:01:36.130> when<00:01:36.369> I'm<00:01:36.490> out

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
everything that's out there when I'm out

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.060 
everything that's out there when I'm out
there<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.260> you<00:01:38.260> know<00:01:38.350> first<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:38.950> foremost

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
there and you know first and foremost

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
there and you know first and foremost
them<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.630> maps<00:01:40.869> are<00:01:41.290> not<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.770> good<00:01:41.950> as<00:01:42.130> they

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
them the maps are not as good as they

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.310 
them the maps are not as good as they
always<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:46.300> think<00:01:46.869> they<00:01:46.990> are<00:01:47.110> they're<00:01:47.290> not

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
always you think they are they're not

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.580 
always you think they are they're not
always<00:01:47.740> accurate<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.900> without<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> doubt<00:01:50.380> that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
always accurate and without a doubt that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.010 
always accurate and without a doubt that
sonar<00:01:51.100> technologies<00:01:51.700> really<00:01:52.479> change<00:01:52.750> things

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
sonar technologies really change things

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.710 
sonar technologies really change things
just<00:01:53.380> because<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.729> know<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.240> precise

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
just because you know it's so precise

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.170 
just because you know it's so precise
you<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.290> know<00:01:56.410> if<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.619> mark<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.490> you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
you you know if you mark them you you

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.060 
you you know if you mark them you you
know<00:01:58.390> they're<00:01:58.960> there<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.200> mean<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.860> catch

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
know they're there I mean you can catch

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.410 
know they're there I mean you can catch
them<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.369> just<00:02:00.820> gives<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.149> ton<00:02:01.390> of

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
them it just gives you a ton of

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.100 
them it just gives you a ton of
confidence<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:03.250> sight<00:02:03.460> imaging<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
confidence and with sight imaging and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.350 
confidence and with sight imaging and
now<00:02:05.350> they<00:02:05.530> got<00:02:05.710> 360<00:02:06.340> imaging<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.970> just<00:02:07.149> makes

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
now they got 360 imaging it just makes

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.180 
now they got 360 imaging it just makes
you<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.690> much<00:02:07.840> more<00:02:07.899> efficient<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.100> know

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
you that much more efficient to you know

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.850 
you that much more efficient to you know
you<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.550> kind<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.390> graphing<00:02:11.260> around<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
you can kind of graphing around and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.020 
you can kind of graphing around and
looking<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.690> know<00:02:13.840> an<00:02:14.640> hour<00:02:15.640> where

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
looking for you know an hour where

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.300 
looking for you know an hour where
you're<00:02:16.150> covering<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.110> five<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.709> 15<00:02:18.070> feet

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
you're covering you know five to 15 feet

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.150 
you're covering you know five to 15 feet
underneath<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.880> boat<00:02:19.150> no<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.770> look<00:02:20.920> at

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
underneath your boat no you can look at

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.390 
underneath your boat no you can look at
150<00:02:21.940> feet<00:02:21.970> really<00:02:22.959> efficiently<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.160> same

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
150 feet really efficiently at the same

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.150 
150 feet really efficiently at the same
time<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.660> know<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.110> makes<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.769> lot

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
time so you know just makes you a lot

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.759 
time so you know just makes you a lot
more<00:02:27.220> efficient<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.000> covering<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.739> know

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
more efficient in covering you know

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.720 
more efficient in covering you know
offshore<00:02:30.310> structures<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:32.340> think<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.580> you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
offshore structures so I think that you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.580 
offshore structures so I think that you
know<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> mean<00:02:34.030> it's<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.269> good<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.560> without<00:02:35.560> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
know I mean it's a good thing without a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.330 
know I mean it's a good thing without a
doubt<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.780> can't<00:02:37.780> forget<00:02:38.170> about<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
doubt but you can't forget about the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.460 
doubt but you can't forget about the
things<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.780> there<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:41.440> I

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
things that got you there you know I

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.009 
things that got you there you know I
mean<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.830> why<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> me<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:43.480> know<00:02:43.570> maps<00:02:43.780> are

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
mean that's why to me you know maps are

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.509 
mean that's why to me you know maps are
still<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.500> important<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.370> because

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
still really important not not because

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.060 
still really important not not because
I'm<00:02:45.820> looking<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.330> map<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.810> see<00:02:47.070> exactly

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
I'm looking at a map to see exactly

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.520 
I'm looking at a map to see exactly
where<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.790> spot<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.510> might<00:02:49.989> hold<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
where the spot is that might hold the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.740 
where the spot is that might hold the
fish<00:02:50.739> but<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> map<00:02:51.910> does<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.450> really

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
fish but what a map does is it really

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.140 
fish but what a map does is it really
gives<00:02:52.900> me<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.290> big<00:02:53.560> picture<00:02:53.980> look<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.910> feel

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
gives me that big picture look and feel

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.960 
gives me that big picture look and feel
of<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.260> spawning<00:02:56.650> areas<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.880> know

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
of you know spawning areas and you know

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.030 
of you know spawning areas and you know
what<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.480> know<00:02:58.600> how<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:59.140> look<00:02:59.500> at<00:02:59.650> an<00:02:59.769> area

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
what you know how I can look at an area

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.620 
what you know how I can look at an area
and<00:03:00.130> see<00:03:00.280> how<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.549> might<00:03:00.670> fit<00:03:00.880> into<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.180> seasonal

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
and see how it might fit into a seasonal

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.710 
and see how it might fit into a seasonal
pattern<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.040> just

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
pattern so you just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.610 
pattern so you just
really<00:03:05.260> substitute<00:03:07.200> any<00:03:08.200> amount<00:03:08.530> of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
really substitute any amount of

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.820 
really substitute any amount of
technology<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:11.410> they've<00:03:11.620> got

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
technology to do that now they've got

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.770 
technology to do that now they've got
programs<00:03:12.220> where<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.849> can<00:03:13.000> actually<00:03:13.239> do<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.660> on

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
programs where you can actually do it on

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.140 
programs where you can actually do it on
your<00:03:13.870> laptop<00:03:14.140> or<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:14.800> your<00:03:14.950> computer<00:03:15.459> at<00:03:16.090> night

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
where you can you know break down the
