makes<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:58.829> easy<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.460> remove<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> cheek

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
makes it really easy to remove the cheek

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.850 
makes it really easy to remove the cheek
pads

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.920 

they're<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.130> tough<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:06.510> very<00:02:06.540> easy

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
they're a little tough so not very easy

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.990 
they're a little tough so not very easy
to<00:02:07.050> come<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.850> worry

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to come out so you don't have to worry

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
to come out so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.360> falling<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.990> when<00:02:10.110> you're

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
about them falling out when you're

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.400 
about them falling out when you're
riding<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.150> also<00:02:12.300> remove<00:02:12.690> them<00:02:13.140> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
riding but you could also remove them in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.630 
riding but you could also remove them in
case<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.920> need<00:02:14.040> some<00:02:14.220> medical<00:02:14.340> attention

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
case you need some medical attention

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.290 
case you need some medical attention
I've<00:02:15.450> noticed<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> v1<00:02:16.770> also<00:02:17.280> had<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
I've noticed that the v1 also had this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.420 
I've noticed that the v1 also had this
this<00:02:18.870> open<00:02:19.320> port<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.070> don't<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.340> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
this open port here so you don't have to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850 
this open port here so you don't have to
take<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> helmet<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:22.260> remove<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> cheek

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
take the helmet off to remove the cheek

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.170 
take the helmet off to remove the cheek
pad<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.250> that's<00:02:23.400> another<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.820> thing<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
pad so that's another good thing to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.400 
pad so that's another good thing to
remove<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> crown<00:02:26.300> few<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.480> snaps<00:02:27.780> here

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.840 

it'll<00:02:31.410> probably<00:02:31.620> help<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.130> open<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> helmet

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
it'll probably help if I open the helmet

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.330 
it'll probably help if I open the helmet
up<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> double<00:02:34.530> d-ring<00:02:34.890> closure

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
up so you have a double d-ring closure

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.810 
up so you have a double d-ring closure
with<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> snap<00:02:36.060> back<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.660> as<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.530> secure<00:02:38.100> closure

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
with a snap back up as a secure closure

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.440 
with a snap back up as a secure closure
there<00:02:40.220> now<00:02:41.220> let<00:02:41.430> me<00:02:41.550> remove<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> crown<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there now let me remove the crown of the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.210 
there now let me remove the crown of the
helmet<00:02:45.020> all<00:02:46.020> right<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.770> look<00:02:46.980> closely

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
here you'll see that there's some air

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.010 
here you'll see that there's some air
ports<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.459> allow<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.820> cool<00:02:51.300> air<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.780> come<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
ports that allow the cool air to come in
