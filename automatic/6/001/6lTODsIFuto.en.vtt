Nexus I don't think I've ever had a game
that<00:02:44.260> close<00:02:44.500> before<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.430> enemy<00:02:45.550> team<00:02:45.820> was

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that close before the enemy team was

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.970 
that close before the enemy team was
actually<00:02:46.570> taking<00:02:46.960> down<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.320> Nexus<00:02:47.680> but<00:02:47.860> then

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
actually taking down the Nexus but then

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.260 
actually taking down the Nexus but then
we<00:02:48.100> were<00:02:48.220> able<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.550> fight<00:02:48.700> them<00:02:48.880> off<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.180> end

up<00:02:49.390> winning<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:50.140> probably<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.590> closest

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
up winning it was probably the closest

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440
