 apart they have to do a little pee 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 data sub words while they are 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.390

 against an influx who want to attack 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.750
 she promises for this job to pay them 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.189
 a million times kaori learns 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 must me baudoux that a rumor circulates 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.339
 according to which a hired killer from usa 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.260
 will be japan to buter city hunter 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.700
 kaori starts to suspect their news 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 customers who seem to be taken to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 middle of a dangerous one that can be 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 had drunk of down once again that's 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 just a long episode of city hunter 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 but this is a fact to say it takes again the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.150
 same classic pattern as any 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.680
 random episode of city hunter and again 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 it's hard too very low singer of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 future range 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 it's not like magnum of love there y'a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.180
 nothing more than if it's just more 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.060
 long 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.619
 the scenario is debilitating complicated there 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.850
 are all rotten twists which leaves 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.190
 nowhere and that is strictly for 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 nothing for the door explained edward 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.650
 paulet but here we fight the balls 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.450
 frankly it's shit this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.370
 so the American is actually a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.170
 agent of the cia that was sent for 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.670
 capture a killer who has himself been 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.870
 sent to buter city hunter 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.070
 so she pretends to be a 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.050
 client to have better chances 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.060
 designers must also know that the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.560
 killer lived the mother's brother except 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 that actually the killer was sent by 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.590
 the boss of the girl who is actually a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.240
 double estion that works for both 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.650
 the ricains and for the russians it's him 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.090
 who made the brother of the mac crash 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.350
 he discovered his scheming of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 blow like the other killer is also at 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 current they were sending killed city hunter 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.210
 knowing that they had no 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.159
 chance to win against rio for it 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.049
 rid him then he sent the sister of the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.549
 guy he did kill to protect city 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.319
 hunter and capture the killer he wants 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.760
 anyway limited to cover themselves 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.560
 did not you all understand these dams 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 start again then the american is in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 reality an agent of the cia who was 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.819
 sent 4 has in fact you're leaving 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 fuck 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.549
 basically all that to understand is 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 that it's completely stupid or because 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.920
 that they send the only person who 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.480
 wants to find out what we could and his 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.830
 brother in pursuit of the only but who 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.939
 know the whole story while 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.470
 sending the only guy who know 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.659
 history I feel usher against 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.860
 rio while sending to the maaf protect 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.090
 rio against the killer 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.920
 this guy is supposed to be the best spy 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.599
 of all the universe 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.680
 she sets up the ideal plot for 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.069
 to be fucked is completely 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.569
 stupid 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.890
 ah yes in addition his conspiracy serves 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.120
 strictly for nothing because in fact the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.709
 guy who unveils himself alone at the end 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.940
 like that at the last minute while 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.440
 damn he had no reason to do 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.790
 salgues the heart wholesale he is in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.349
 position of strength they just had to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.580
 wait for rio but the person killer 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.959
 would never have known anything but no to the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.230
 last minute jerry louis did that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.150
 I am a double spies dindane nerves 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.830
 what's this bastard then the rest of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.930
 the water had amazed reason more scenes 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.519

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.860
 then a super kale professional killer 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.120

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.050
 making stuff that's miracles there 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:21.680
 it's not possible what it does 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:22.610
 look at this scene so here I do not know 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.049
 if you are aware of the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.250
 bullshit of 7.7 so I'll get you the 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.590
 to make my sauce like you are well 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.910
 that we take to kill define if you're afraid 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.000

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.450
 of balls I had to reload an I 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.829

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:47.769
 there is I want to shoot a two three guys 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:55.269
 I'm going to kill you 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:58.640
 aye it's impossible how did he do it 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.170
 it's just impossible the case in one 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.120
 tenth of a second he succeeds in 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.859
 reload his gun fired into the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.480
 gun from the guy across the way it's 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.790
 anything that happens to fire in 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.230
 the balls again I want the scene where 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.220
 he's getting missiles by pulling on I 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.560
 okay but that's not possible 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.760
 must stop what matters but otherwise 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.350
 I 'm interested in knowing how 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.510
 to shoot as well as city 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.510
 hunter well here's his secret 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.570
 no I'm not kidding you too you thought 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.980
 that it was a diversion a notebook 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.120
 like that bah no no no it's really 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.200
 the real scene even in Japanese 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.270
 it's exactly the same 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.260
 what in fact I recommend I was 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.550
 happy because you think it's 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.810
 city ​​hunter and that's good 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.400
 because he had known a life like 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.780
 of adventure of danger you see the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 recollets muffled conflicts he had 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 suffered a workout beast and me 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.610
 I was we made the solution it's 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.660
 because he had love in his 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.980
 little heart so if you have some 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.840

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.880
