00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
just kind of get them to match up a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
just kind of get them to match up a
little<00:00:24.210> bit<00:00:24.449> closer

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
from the factory of course because we're

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.130 
from the factory of course because we're
changing<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.190> collar<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.120> man<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.600> livable

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.340 
I'm pretty particular and I can live
with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> texture<00:01:51.870> of<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.110> seats<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
with the texture of the seats I've got a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
with the texture of the seats I've got a
2011<00:01:55.350> Dodge<00:01:55.980> Ram<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.850> initially<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
2011 Dodge Ram and initially that the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.680 
2011 Dodge Ram and initially that the
factory<00:01:58.620> seen<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> nylon<00:02:00.270> kind<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
factory seen in it is that nylon kind of

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.590 
factory seen in it is that nylon kind of
stuff<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.080> it's<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:01.620> harder<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:03.480> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
stuff and it's actually harder to the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.310 
stuff and it's actually harder to the
touch<00:02:03.870> they<00:02:04.440> want<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.800> it<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:06.020> you'd<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
touch they want this it so you'd be the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.500 
touch they want this it so you'd be the
judge<00:02:07.620> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> can't<00:02:08.730> say<00:02:08.940> hey<00:02:09.149> guys

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
judge you know I can't say hey guys

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.140 
judge you know I can't say hey guys
everybody's<00:02:10.080> gonna<00:02:10.230> love<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.820> by

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
everybody's gonna love it but it's by

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.480 
everybody's gonna love it but it's by
far<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.480> feeling<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> piece

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
far not feeling like like it's a piece

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.280 
far not feeling like like it's a piece
of<00:02:14.700> plastic<00:02:15.270> duration<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.870> didn't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
of plastic duration you know it didn't

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:37.290 
of plastic duration you know it didn't
take<00:02:19.590> away<00:02:19.770> all<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> fluff<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> Fuller

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.450 

like<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.990> say<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.440> kind<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.860> man<00:02:39.130> it's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
like I say you can kind of see man it's

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.460 
like I say you can kind of see man it's
just<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.760> stuff<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.120> dries<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:41.050> quick

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
just the stuff just dries really quick

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
just the stuff just dries really quick
and<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.430> think<00:02:42.700> that's<00:02:42.850> part<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> secret

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and I think that's part of the secret

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.450 
and I think that's part of the secret
and<00:02:44.380> then<00:02:44.560> when<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.800> rub<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.010> hand<00:02:45.310> like

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and then when you rub your hand like

00:02:45.460 --> 00:03:42.660 
and then when you rub your hand like
this<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:45.880> nice<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.210> smooth

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.720 

let<00:03:43.210> it<00:03:43.330> flash<00:03:43.510> for<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.900> second<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:45.490> down<00:03:45.670> here

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
let it flash for a second this down here

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:55.010 
let it flash for a second this down here
is<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.030> little<00:03:46.420> more<00:03:46.630> wet

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.560 

hopefully<00:03:55.830> hopefully<00:03:56.550> it's<00:03:56.880> looking<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.330> to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
hopefully hopefully it's looking good to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:06.940 
hopefully hopefully it's looking good to
you<00:03:58.760> standing<00:03:59.760> here<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.120> really<00:04:00.570> looks<00:04:00.810> good

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.470 

of<00:04:07.280> course<00:04:07.550> remember<00:04:07.790> these<00:04:08.060> things<00:04:08.240> were

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
spot in it right through here but I've

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.890 
spot in it right through here but I've
got<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.560> watch<00:04:45.890> because<00:04:46.880> light<00:04:47.180> plays<00:04:47.540> tricks

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900
