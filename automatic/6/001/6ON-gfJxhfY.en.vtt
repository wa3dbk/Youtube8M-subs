you'll<00:00:45.860> notice<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.400> looks<00:00:46.610> like<00:00:46.670> their

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
you'll notice is it looks like their

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.020 
you'll notice is it looks like their
only<00:00:47.000> female<00:00:47.570> character<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.440> I<00:00:48.820> don't<00:00:49.820> know<00:00:49.940> if

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
only female character so I don't know if

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.310 
only female character so I don't know if
there's<00:00:50.150> a<00:00:50.210> lower<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.720> game<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.140> maybe

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
there's a lower to the game and maybe

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's a lower to the game and maybe
it's<00:00:51.500> only<00:00:51.650> female<00:00:52.159> or<00:00:52.460> if<00:00:52.909> it's<00:00:53.030> just<00:00:53.360> kind<00:00:53.720> of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
it's only female or if it's just kind of

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.149 
it's only female or if it's just kind of
fanservice<00:00:55.960> graphics<00:00:56.960> showing<00:00:57.470> off<00:00:57.620> lots<00:00:57.920> of

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
fanservice graphics showing off lots of

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.829 
fanservice graphics showing off lots of
well<00:00:58.610> ta<00:00:59.049> but<00:01:00.049> that's<00:01:00.710> just<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.839> couldn't

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
well ta but that's just I couldn't

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.149 
well ta but that's just I couldn't
actually<00:01:03.110> figure<00:01:03.290> out<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:03.440> never<00:01:03.739> saw<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:03.979> male

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
actually figure out I never saw a male

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.469 
actually figure out I never saw a male
character<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.670> think<00:01:04.909> that's<00:01:05.059> just<00:01:05.150> part<00:01:05.269> of

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
character so I think that's just part of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.230 
character so I think that's just part of
the<00:01:05.540> game<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.070> world<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.030> can<00:01:08.119> see

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
the game in the world you can see

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.090 
the game in the world you can see
character<00:01:08.600> creation<00:01:08.890> decent<00:01:09.890> amount<00:01:10.070> of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
character creation decent amount of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.389 
character creation decent amount of
depth<00:01:10.340> for<00:01:10.570> her<00:01:11.570> free-to-play<00:01:11.899> game<00:01:12.399> it's

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
depth for her free-to-play game it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.029 
depth for her free-to-play game it's
