00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.230 
preserve as much muscle as possible way
too<00:00:26.529> low<00:00:26.830> intensity<00:00:27.250> cardio<00:00:27.519> something<00:00:28.090> looks

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.800 
too low intensity cardio something looks
like<00:00:28.449> water<00:00:28.720> drop<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:29.830> an<00:00:29.980> hour<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.449> lose

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810

I've talked to people have a holic to my
cardio<00:01:08.320> when<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.800> say<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.009> do<00:01:09.160> want<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.340> treadmill

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
cardio when I say I do want a treadmill

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.850 
cardio when I say I do want a treadmill
they<00:01:10.330> immediately<00:01:10.780> say<00:01:11.080> well<00:01:11.289> that's<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.679> pain

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
they immediately say well that's a pain

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.140 
they immediately say well that's a pain
in<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:11.950> ass<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.340> got<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.549> speed<00:01:12.759> down<00:01:12.880> and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
in the ass it's got to speed down and

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.240 
in the ass it's got to speed down and
speed<00:01:13.330> up<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.479> treadmill<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.680> it's<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.100> pain

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
speed up the treadmill and it's a pain

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.340 
speed up the treadmill and it's a pain
in<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> ass<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.810> thought<00:01:16.810> was<00:01:16.900> common<00:01:17.170> sense

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
in the ass I thought was common sense

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.660 
in the ass I thought was common sense
but<00:01:17.500> apparently<00:01:17.830> it's<00:01:17.979> not<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.250> what<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.400> do<00:01:18.490> we

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
but apparently it's not so what I do we

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.120 
but apparently it's not so what I do we
set<00:01:18.880> up<00:01:18.909> two<00:01:19.119> treadmills<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.130> treadmills

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
set up two treadmills and treadmills

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.039 
set up two treadmills and treadmills
here<00:01:21.310> one<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.939> them<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.240> going<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.509> be<00:01:22.570> high

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
here one of them is going to be high

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.630 
here one of them is going to be high
speed<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:23.799> keep<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.280> highest

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
speed so I just keep it the highest

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.550 
speed so I just keep it the highest
speed<00:01:24.820> possible<00:01:24.850> let<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.479> run<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.439> other

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
speed possible let it run and the other

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.719 
speed possible let it run and the other
one<00:01:26.740> will<00:01:26.829> be<00:01:26.860> low<00:01:27.040> speed<00:01:27.310> when<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.549> floor

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
one will be low speed when I floor

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.940 
one will be low speed when I floor
walking<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> keep<00:01:28.960> them<00:01:29.110> both<00:01:29.259> on<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.890> same

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
walking so I keep them both on the same

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.760 
walking so I keep them both on the same
time<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.520> switch<00:01:30.850> back<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.060> forth<00:01:31.380> alright<00:01:32.470> 20

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
time I switch back and forth alright 20

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.719 
time I switch back and forth alright 20
second<00:01:33.100> first<00:01:33.310> first<00:01:33.700> right

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:56.120 

I<00:01:52.969> like<00:01:53.969> to<00:01:54.149> look<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.289> circle<00:01:55.770> field

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
I like to look at this in a circle field

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
I like to look at this in a circle field
right<00:01:56.429> here<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> sprint<00:01:57.329> there's<00:01:57.869> always

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
right here when I sprint there's always

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
right here when I sprint there's always
kids<00:01:58.319> running<00:01:58.679> around<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.700> Ronnie

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
perspective I could totally see this
