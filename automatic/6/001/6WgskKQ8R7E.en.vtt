important<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.740> develop<00:00:02.310> angles<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.300> your

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
important to develop angles for your

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.420 
important to develop angles for your
offense<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.080> it's<00:00:04.470> important<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> work<00:00:05.279> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
offense and it's important to work the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.120 
offense and it's important to work the
circles<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.270> keep<00:00:06.569> your<00:00:06.629> body<00:00:06.960> moving<00:00:07.230> our

circles so you keep your body moving our
targets<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.849> hitch<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.679> the<00:00:10.679> circle<00:00:11.160> step

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
targets a hitch so the circle step

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
targets a hitch so the circle step
starts<00:00:11.849> out<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.410> stepping<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:14.009> you're

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
starts out with stepping it's you're

starts out with stepping it's you're
laughing<00:00:14.490> right<00:00:14.790> first<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.430> was<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> circle

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
laughing right first so I was a circle

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.730 
laughing right first so I was a circle
to<00:00:18.330> my<00:00:18.510> left<00:00:18.900> first

I'm<00:00:19.830> gonna<00:00:20.010> step<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:20.730> left<00:00:21.320> cert<00:00:22.320> my<00:00:22.500> right

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I'm gonna step to my left cert my right

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.730 
I'm gonna step to my left cert my right
step<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.640> Cruz<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> circle<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
step to my right Cruz so a circle to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
step to my right Cruz so a circle to
your<00:00:25.890> left<00:00:26.099> you're<00:00:26.340> gonna<00:00:26.460> snap<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> slide

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

refer to as a pocket we want to stay out
of<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of that so we go back to right to that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.230 
of that so we go back to right to that
movement<00:01:26.700> first

movement first

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
movement first
so<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.110> circle<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.829> left<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> key<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so as I circle to my left the key is to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
so as I circle to my left the key is to
have<00:01:29.729> short<00:01:30.329> choppy<00:01:30.659> steps

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
have short choppy steps

keep them grounded keeping them grounded
means<00:02:10.769> I'm<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.130> circling<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.739> my<00:02:13.739> feet

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
means I'm not circling like this my feet

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.270 
means I'm not circling like this my feet
bouncing<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:16.050> takes<00:02:16.290> too<00:02:16.500> long<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.920> come<00:02:17.130> out

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
bouncing it takes too long to come out

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
bouncing it takes too long to come out
of<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> balance<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> stop<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> able<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
of that balance to stop and be able to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110 
of that balance to stop and be able to
react<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.739> keep<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.130> grounded<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.970> we're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
react and we keep it grounded so we're

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.880 
react and we keep it grounded so we're
ready<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> react<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.989> foot<00:02:22.319> second

around and this is my service state so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.030 
around and this is my service state so
you<00:02:34.950> had<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> circle<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.120> left<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.980> you
