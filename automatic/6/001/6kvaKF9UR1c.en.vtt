00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

for<00:00:57.160> me<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.490> bike<00:00:57.640> with<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.880> most

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
for me it's the bike with the most

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.110 
for me it's the bike with the most
potential<00:00:58.750> in<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.260> shootout<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.670> handles

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
potential in the shootout it handles

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.450 
potential in the shootout it handles
good<00:01:01.240> it's<00:01:01.480> nimble<00:01:01.870> I'll<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.590> love<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.100> seating

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
good it's nimble I'll I love the seating

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.760 
good it's nimble I'll I love the seating
position<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.090> ergonomics<00:01:04.630> of<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.930> I<00:01:05.110> love

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770

the<00:01:05.860> quick<00:01:06.040> shifter<00:01:06.190> on<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.820> worked

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the quick shifter on it that worked

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the quick shifter on it that worked
actually<00:01:08.170> really<00:01:08.410> well<00:01:08.530> probably<00:01:09.010> better

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
actually really well probably better

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.370 
actually really well probably better
than<00:01:09.370> any<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> other<00:01:10.000> two<00:01:10.930> or<00:01:11.050> three<00:01:11.200> bikes

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
that actually had the quick shifter it

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.810 
that actually had the quick shifter it
was<00:01:14.560> such<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> different<00:01:15.160> feel<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.370> different

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
was such a different feel a different

sound<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.480> different<00:01:16.780> feel<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.170> motor<00:01:17.380> I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
sound a different feel of the motor I

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.710 
sound a different feel of the motor I
wasn't<00:01:18.220> really<00:01:18.310> sure<00:01:18.520> what<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.670> expect<00:01:19.240> but

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
wasn't really sure what to expect but

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.870 
wasn't really sure what to expect but
once<00:01:20.260> out<00:01:20.410> on<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.560> track<00:01:20.800> everything<00:01:21.340> came

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
once out on the track everything came

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.560 
once out on the track everything came
together

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
together

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.110 
together
turnin<00:01:23.020> was<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.260> breeze<00:01:23.560> um<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.880> only<00:01:25.030> thing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
turnin was a breeze um the only thing

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.240 
turnin was a breeze um the only thing
that<00:01:25.480> kind<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.720> caught<00:01:25.870> me<00:01:25.900> off-guard<00:01:26.140> was<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
that kind of caught me off-guard was the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.460 
that kind of caught me off-guard was the
acceleration<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:28.690> know<00:01:28.780> you're<00:01:29.020> waiting<00:01:29.320> for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
acceleration you know you're waiting for

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.380 
acceleration you know you're waiting for
it<00:01:29.830> you're<00:01:30.250> like<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.610> coming<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.060> once<00:01:31.240> it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
it you're like is it coming and once it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.930 
it you're like is it coming and once it
comes<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.870> pops<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.470> it's<00:01:32.800> very<00:01:33.460> visceral

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
comes it pops like it's very visceral

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.030 
comes it pops like it's very visceral
feeling<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.660> know<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.900> felt<00:01:35.110> great<00:01:35.260> but<00:01:35.619> at

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
feeling you know it felt great but at

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.980 
feeling you know it felt great but at
the<00:01:36.310> same<00:01:36.400> time<00:01:36.580> was<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.850> kind<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.540> wondering

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
the same time was like kind of wondering

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.240 
the same time was like kind of wondering
when's<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.619> gonna<00:01:38.740> drop<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:41.770> surprised

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
when's it gonna drop in I was surprised

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.740 
when's it gonna drop in I was surprised
you<00:01:42.460> turn<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.880> throttle<00:01:43.060> on<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.390> thing<00:01:43.600> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
you turn the throttle on that thing and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
you turn the throttle on that thing and
if<00:01:43.840> burped<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.380> goes<00:01:45.510> a<00:01:46.510> little<00:01:47.140> soft<00:01:47.500> up<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
if burped it goes a little soft up the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.710 
if burped it goes a little soft up the
bottom<00:01:48.100> but<00:01:48.220> once<00:01:48.400> it's<00:01:48.580> in<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.760> revs<00:01:49.000> snappy

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
bottom but once it's in the revs snappy

I<00:01:50.590> think<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.250> electronics<00:01:51.760> we're<00:01:51.880> kind<00:01:52.030> of

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
I think the electronics we're kind of

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.760 
I think the electronics we're kind of
working<00:01:52.210> against<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.750> bike<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.410> go<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.590> let

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
working against the bike you go to let

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.170 
working against the bike you go to let
off<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.040> gas<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.490> kind<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.790> likes<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.030> keep

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
off the gas it kind of likes to keep

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.780 
off the gas it kind of likes to keep
going<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.890> took<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.220> little<00:01:57.340> getting<00:01:57.640> used

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
going so that took a little getting used

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.940 
going so that took a little getting used
to<00:01:57.880> but<00:01:57.970> bikes<00:01:58.630> got<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.900> lot<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.200> potential<00:01:59.800> as

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
to but bikes got a lot of potential as

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.830 
to but bikes got a lot of potential as
you<00:02:00.550> get<00:02:00.700> into<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> corner<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.300> crack<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
you get into the corner you crack the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.450 
you get into the corner you crack the
throttle<00:02:02.200> open<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.740> feels<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.280> bike

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
throttle open and it feels like the bike

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.330 
throttle open and it feels like the bike
has<00:02:03.670> full<00:02:04.000> power<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.420> feels<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:05.220> little<00:02:06.220> bit

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
has full power and it feels a little bit

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.040 
has full power and it feels a little bit
jerky<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:06.820> off<00:02:07.060> throttle<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.929> little

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
jerky on off throttle like it's a little

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.260 
jerky on off throttle like it's a little
bit<00:02:08.259> too<00:02:08.410> aggressive<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.429> then<00:02:09.580> as<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:10.060> roll

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
bit too aggressive but then as you roll

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.450 
bit too aggressive but then as you roll
the<00:02:10.420> throttle<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.200> exit<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> corner<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
the throttle on to exit the corner it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.580 
the throttle on to exit the corner it
feels<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> bike<00:02:13.300> doesn't<00:02:13.660> like

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
feels like the bike doesn't like

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.500 
feels like the bike doesn't like
something's<00:02:15.040> holding<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.460> back<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:16.180> feels

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
something's holding it back it feels

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.000 
something's holding it back it feels
like<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> motor<00:02:16.960> wants<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> go<00:02:17.500> faster<00:02:17.980> but

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
like the motor wants to go faster but

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.620 
like the motor wants to go faster but
that<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.490> kind<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.940> choked<00:02:19.180> off<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> little

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
that it's kind of choked off a little

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.230 
that it's kind of choked off a little
bit<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.800> ranked<00:02:21.310> pretty<00:02:21.550> far<00:02:21.790> down<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.120> list

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
bit it ranked pretty far down the list

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.090 
bit it ranked pretty far down the list
for<00:02:22.420> me<00:02:22.570> but<00:02:22.960> that's<00:02:23.290> mostly<00:02:23.590> because<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
for me but that's mostly because of the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.130 
for me but that's mostly because of the
electronics<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.790> think<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> could<00:02:25.330> control

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
electronics I think if you could control

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.890 
electronics I think if you could control
that<00:02:26.530> issue<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:27.160> think<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.540> bike<00:02:28.720> would

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that issue I think that the bike would

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.870 
that issue I think that the bike would
have<00:02:28.990> ranked<00:02:29.230> quite<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.440> bit<00:02:29.620> higher<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.610> bike

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
have ranked quite a bit higher the bike

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.410 
have ranked quite a bit higher the bike
was<00:02:31.540> probably<00:02:32.319> my<00:02:32.710> slowest<00:02:33.220> bike<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:34.000> terms<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
was probably my slowest bike in terms of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.110 
was probably my slowest bike in terms of
lap<00:02:34.630> time<00:02:34.960> but<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.069> couldn't<00:02:36.520> tell<00:02:36.700> when<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.970> was

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
lap time but I couldn't tell when I was

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.270 
lap time but I couldn't tell when I was
riding<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.660> when<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.080> was<00:02:38.230> riding<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.860> was<00:02:39.010> having

riding it when I was riding I was having

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.880 
riding it when I was riding I was having
a<00:02:39.370> blast<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.569> wrong<00:02:41.020> get<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.770> the
