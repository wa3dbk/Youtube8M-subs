00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.730
 Spartak Cup final match 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.070
 the hosts of the tournament met Kiev 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.830
 the dynamo spartak 100 showed serious and 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.019
 zeal for the will to win Kiev did not want 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.939
 yield to your opponent in the end 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.320
 confrontation of the two best known 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.099
 post-soviet football schools 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.199
 spaces 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.569
 ended in victory red and white with 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.060
 score one-zero single ball scored 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.640
 Alexander Yuryev with three swords became 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.220
 top scorer to your team and place 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 Spartak also took the third wards 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.790
 Vladimir Zubanova 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.010
 have not lost a single match but plenty 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.590
 draws led Spartacus on the third 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.500
 line above the academy of barcelona and 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.070
 the celtic of the eternal struggle of akiva against 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 Moscow 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.590
 I think that here and down to the main 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.040
 teams I think everyone was worried 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.590
 so it wins double 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.489
 nice this victory then if you won 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.890
 the cup would then be great if occupied 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.750
 third place is therefore good overall 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.789
 Well done guys and no to him 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.310
 no complaints laid out every match 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:13.649
 something turned out that there is no well I think 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.649
 have time to work on bugs
