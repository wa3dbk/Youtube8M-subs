00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello all boys and girls welcome 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.350
 to the practical in the video now I'm going 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.500
 to say some ideas that you can do 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.110
 with those glasses of being more and give it a 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.999
 second use when you finish the coffee 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.749
 ice cream what you have to do is 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:26.029
 thoroughly disinfect the vas vessel 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:29.149
 use masks purplish ribbon is 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.090
 Optional acrylic color paint 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.699
 the glitter you're using what 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.320
 nice thing about this project is that we're going to 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:42.570
 recycle those glasses that will serve us 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.990
 as decoration of the house 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 [Music] 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.890
 in the first grass what they are going to do is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 apply a thick layer of marks with a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.230
 brush or sponge all over the 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.689
 outline of the logo 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.689
 [Music] 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.440
 they have to be very careful not to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.200
 apply it in the logos because if they do 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.510
 they have to clean it immediately and 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.280
 this form the glitter is not going to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.990
 paste or they will cover the drawing 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.619
 [Music] 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.619
 and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.729
 before applying the glitter 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.119
 they will protect the work area or the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.090
 surface in this case the table with a 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.630
 newspaper or recycled paper that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.360
 you have that because when 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.259
 we use glitter, it makes us a 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.819
 true disaster so they have to 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.030
 avoid all that by covering very well the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.030
 table 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.360
 with a sponge or brush make the step 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.140
 previous by applying a thick layer of 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:57.830
 easier 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:03:01.260
 [Music] 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.120
 with a few strokes in the glass remove 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:11.550
 excess glitter 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.550
 [Music] 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.800
 let the first layer of glitter dry 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.220
 about 25 minutes or until you 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.160
 be sure that it is already dry and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.160
 then apply again easier 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.360
 [Music] 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.360
