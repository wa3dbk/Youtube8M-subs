00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.179
 Hi, I'm Maria Leon and I'm from TV 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.770
 with wardrobe I think that always 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.539
 have a cowboy who feels good not 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.800
 for situations that can be both 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.689
 formal as informal all 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.500
 we depend on how not to mix then 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.360
 then a dark blazer because a blazer 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.920
 is the solution to formalize a look 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 not for example low in a dress 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.350
 informal you put a jacket on and 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.900
 you already get the sophisticated point a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.790
 white shirt a white shirt a 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.519
 black dress also for situations 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.650
 sophisticated and I would also tell you that 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.549
 a high -heeled shoe and a flat ballerina 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.260
 for a flat shoe you have a 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.439
 section in the blog that is the office 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 where different people ask me 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:07.570
 how to dress then for a communion that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.070
 have or a wedding and also how 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.080
 combine some dress that have me 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.290
 they send the photos and I give my opinion 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 of how to combine the good there are some 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 what I like 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.659
 for example I really like the style of 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.329
 susanna griso I do not think she dresses 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.570
 ideal and very favored must see the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.610
 situation is not an informational requires 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.210
 a more sober than usual attire that is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.340
 Nor is it a matter of going with a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.770
 tendency too exaggerated because no 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.679
 is what touches what I see appropriate depends 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.270
 of the kind of program I think there's 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.979
 Know how to dress appropriately in each 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 occasion there are times that requires having 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.360
 a little more sophisticated styling and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.360
 other times less 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.410
 but I think we need a 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.270
 brushstroke because when you travel 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.490
 lives 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.090
 abroad in other cities like 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.450
 you saw in people, yes, I have 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 to say that some little dot we would miss 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.110
 to be daring
