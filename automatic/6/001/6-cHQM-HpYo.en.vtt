00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
are going to put the well I guess you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.129 
are going to put the well I guess you
don't<00:04:16.209> have<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.479> put<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:16.659> bracket<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.049> place

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
don't have to put the bracket in place

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.740 
don't have to put the bracket in place
first<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.829> did<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.430> spring<00:04:18.729> is<00:04:18.880> like<00:04:19.090> either

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
first you did the spring is like either

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.479 
first you did the spring is like either
the<00:04:19.930> second<00:04:20.260> thing<00:04:20.409> or<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.039> bracket<00:04:21.430> it

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
the second thing or the bracket it

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.980 
the second thing or the bracket it
doesn't<00:04:21.699> matter<00:04:21.849> what<00:04:21.969> order<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.240> do<00:04:22.389> them<00:04:22.510> in

doesn't matter what order you do them in
probably<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.710> spring<00:04:23.919> maybe<00:04:24.069> the<00:04:24.280> second

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
probably the spring maybe the second

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.689 
probably the spring maybe the second
thing<00:04:25.199> get<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:26.289> put<00:04:26.440> together<00:04:26.530> put<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:27.639> the

the master cylinder first as opposed to

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.710 
the master cylinder first as opposed to
the<00:04:51.009> spring<00:04:51.280> first<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:52.300> know<00:04:52.389> if<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.569> mess

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
the spring first you know if the mess

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.529 
the spring first you know if the mess
around<00:04:52.840> with<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.340> zip<00:04:55.270> ties<00:04:55.419> or

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
around with a you know zip ties or

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.850 
around with a you know zip ties or
anything<00:04:55.810> we<00:04:55.900> get<00:04:56.020> because<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.560> have<00:04:56.650> plenty

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
anything we get because you have plenty

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.999 
anything we get because you have plenty
of<00:04:57.960> play<00:04:58.960> in<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.169> pedal<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.500> get<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> spring

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
of play in the pedal to get the spring

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.529 
of play in the pedal to get the spring
in<00:05:00.159> without<00:05:00.400> having<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.759> to<00:05:01.090> compress<00:05:01.389> it

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
in without having to to compress it

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.010 
in without having to to compress it
first<00:05:01.750> so<00:05:02.729> leave<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.819> spring<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.210> press<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
first so leave the spring out press the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.600 
first so leave the spring out press the
spring<00:05:05.259> then<00:05:05.620> put<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.860> master<00:05:06.159> cylinder<00:05:06.310> in

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
spring then put the master cylinder in

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.700 
spring then put the master cylinder in
after<00:05:07.120> that<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.360> can<00:05:07.479> put<00:05:07.659> bolt<00:05:08.139> this<00:05:08.259> bracket

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
after that you can put bolt this bracket

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.649 
after that you can put bolt this bracket
back<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.069> you<00:05:09.849> know<00:05:09.940> put<00:05:10.120> your<00:05:10.270> electrical

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
back in you know put your electrical

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:11.939 
back in you know put your electrical
connectors<00:05:10.990> back<00:05:11.110> together<00:05:11.289> if<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.590> took<00:05:11.740> any

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
connectors back together if you took any

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.980 
connectors back together if you took any
uh<00:05:12.039> any<00:05:12.580> out<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.389> are<00:05:13.539> good<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.840> go

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
clips in there to hold everything

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.540 
clips in there to hold everything
together<00:05:16.919> make<00:05:17.919> sure<00:05:17.949> it's<00:05:18.190> nice<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.370> tight

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
together make sure it's nice and tight

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.439 
together make sure it's nice and tight
and<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.990> know<00:05:20.080> that's<00:05:20.259> pretty<00:05:20.560> much<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.919> so<00:05:21.449> I

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
and you know that's pretty much it so I

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.210 
and you know that's pretty much it so I
can't<00:05:22.659> make<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.900> little<00:05:23.139> bit<00:05:23.319> more<00:05:23.470> clear

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
can't make this a little bit more clear

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.890 
can't make this a little bit more clear
I<00:05:24.280> got<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> fisheye<00:05:25.360> lens<00:05:25.389> on<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.870> camera

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
I got a fisheye lens on the camera

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.469 
I got a fisheye lens on the camera
because<00:05:26.500> anything<00:05:27.460> else<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.880> was<00:05:28.030> using<00:05:28.240> was

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
because anything else I was using was

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.270 
because anything else I was using was
just<00:05:28.659> uh<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:29.440> know<00:05:29.560> was<00:05:29.680> way<00:05:29.800> too<00:05:29.860> close<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
just uh you know was way too close to

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.850 
just uh you know was way too close to
see<00:05:30.430> anything<00:05:30.699> that<00:05:30.820> was<00:05:30.909> going<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.860> I

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
see anything that was going on so I

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.800 
see anything that was going on so I
don't<00:05:33.430> know<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.520> mean<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:34.150> good<00:05:34.330> news<00:05:34.479> is<00:05:34.630> it's

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
don't know I mean the good news is it's

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.360 
don't know I mean the good news is it's
not<00:05:34.930> all<00:05:35.110> that<00:05:35.139> bad<00:05:35.469> if<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.919> do<00:05:36.039> things<00:05:36.250> in

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
not all that bad if you do things in

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.170 
not all that bad if you do things in
that<00:05:36.460> order<00:05:36.669> it<00:05:37.330> uh<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:38.680> took<00:05:38.889> me<00:05:39.070> about<00:05:40.060> an

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
that order it uh it took me about an

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.450 
that order it uh it took me about an
hour<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.509> do<00:05:40.659> this<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.169> that<00:05:42.159> was<00:05:42.250> kind<00:05:42.430> of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
hour to do this and that was kind of

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.620 
hour to do this and that was kind of
messing<00:05:42.669> around<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.940> know<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.090> could<00:05:43.300> do<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.419> lot

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
messing around I know I could do a lot

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.749 
messing around I know I could do a lot
quicker<00:05:43.810> now<00:05:44.259> that<00:05:44.409> I<00:05:44.500> have<00:05:45.340> developed<00:05:45.550> a

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
quicker now that I have developed a

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.540 
quicker now that I have developed a
little<00:05:45.880> bit<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.240> plan<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.860> bad<00:05:48.070> news<00:05:48.310> is

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
little bit of a plan the the bad news is

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.430 
little bit of a plan the the bad news is
I<00:05:48.759> replace<00:05:49.120> my<00:05:49.150> bushings<00:05:49.719> up<00:05:49.840> here<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.259> I

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
I replace my bushings up here and I

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.110 
I replace my bushings up here and I
still<00:05:50.680> have<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:51.009> like<00:05:51.219> side-to-side<00:05:51.580> slop

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
still have this like side-to-side slop

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.770 
still have this like side-to-side slop
in<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.389> pedal<00:05:52.740> I<00:05:54.240> took<00:05:55.240> everything<00:05:55.449> apart

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
in the pedal I took everything apart

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.469 
in the pedal I took everything apart
again<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.409> then<00:05:57.159> I<00:05:57.190> put<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.430> went<00:05:58.270> down<00:05:58.360> the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
again and then I put a went down the

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.059 
again and then I put a went down the
hardware<00:05:58.659> store<00:05:58.900> got<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> nylon<00:05:59.259> washer<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.949> put

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
hardware store got a nylon washer to put

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.770 
hardware store got a nylon washer to put
it<00:06:00.130> up<00:06:00.190> there<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.430> kind<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.610> Shem<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:01.000> the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
it up there and kind of Shem the the

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.540 
it up there and kind of Shem the the
bushings<00:06:02.169> up<00:06:02.349> and<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.919> helped<00:06:03.159> a<00:06:03.250> little<00:06:03.340> bit

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
bushings up and that helped a little bit

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.290 
bushings up and that helped a little bit
but<00:06:03.759> they're<00:06:03.880> still<00:06:04.060> definitely

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
but they're still definitely

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.290 
but they're still definitely
side-to-side<00:06:05.169> slop<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:05.650> there's<00:06:06.009> I<00:06:06.490> think

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
side-to-side slop and there's I think

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.920 
side-to-side slop and there's I think
really<00:06:07.539> what<00:06:07.750> needs<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:08.110> be<00:06:08.289> done<00:06:08.469> is<00:06:08.680> just<00:06:08.759> the

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
really what needs to be done is just the

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.059 
really what needs to be done is just the
holes<00:06:10.930> where<00:06:11.110> these<00:06:11.229> pins<00:06:11.469> go<00:06:11.680> through<00:06:11.919> or

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
holes where these pins go through or

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.620 
holes where these pins go through or
probably<00:06:12.490> just<00:06:12.699> worn<00:06:12.969> on<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.210> clutch<00:06:13.449> pedal

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
probably just worn on the clutch pedal

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.420 
probably just worn on the clutch pedal
itself<00:06:14.050> I'm<00:06:14.440> just<00:06:14.710> gonna<00:06:14.800> replace<00:06:15.069> the<00:06:15.219> entire

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
itself I'm just gonna replace the entire

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.450 
itself I'm just gonna replace the entire
pedal<00:06:15.930> I<00:06:16.930> mean<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:17.830> can<00:06:17.919> get<00:06:17.979> them<00:06:18.130> online<00:06:18.280> I

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
pedal I mean you can get them online I

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.820 
pedal I mean you can get them online I
think<00:06:18.729> for<00:06:18.969> like<00:06:19.060> 30<00:06:19.360> bucks<00:06:19.630> with<00:06:20.440> my<00:06:20.590> own

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
think for like 30 bucks with my own

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.129
