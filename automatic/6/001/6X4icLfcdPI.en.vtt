00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
like a eight millisecond response time

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
like a eight millisecond response time
and<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.760> thought<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.150> cool<00:02:21.269> at<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> time

and then I got on a monitor with a two

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
and then I got on a monitor with a two
milliseconds<00:02:23.489> time<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:25.019> gameplay

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
milliseconds time and my gameplay

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920 
milliseconds time and my gameplay
increased<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.190> rapid<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.849> make<00:02:27.750> sure<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
increased like rapid so make sure that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.509 
increased like rapid so make sure that
you<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.230> something<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> low<00:02:28.950> millisecond

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
guys all the controllers that I've used

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.050 
guys all the controllers that I've used
I<00:04:30.140> used<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.740> like<00:04:31.010> have<00:04:31.250> such<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> placebo

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.790 
I used to be like have such a placebo
effect<00:04:32.419> on<00:04:32.570> my<00:04:32.660> controllers<00:04:33.140> that<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.320> needed<00:04:33.620> a

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
effect on my controllers that I needed a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.590 
effect on my controllers that I needed a
new<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.100> like<00:04:34.190> every<00:04:34.250> seven<00:04:34.970> weeks<00:04:35.000> or<00:04:35.450> eight

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
new one like every seven weeks or eight

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.120 
new one like every seven weeks or eight
weeks<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.080> would<00:04:36.229> get<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.410> new<00:04:36.590> controller<00:04:37.010> I

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
weeks so I would get a new controller I

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.560 
weeks so I would get a new controller I
just<00:04:37.340> throw<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.610> other<00:04:37.729> ones<00:04:37.880> in<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.030> box<00:04:38.270> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
just throw the other ones in a box I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.270

have<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:38.990> bunch<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.410> used<00:04:39.620> controllers<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.100> need

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
have a bunch of used controllers I need

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.310 
have a bunch of used controllers I need
to<00:04:40.340> get<00:04:40.460> rid<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.640> eventually<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.840> going<00:04:42.140> into

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
to get rid of eventually but going into

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.580 
to get rid of eventually but going into
the<00:04:42.500> next<00:04:42.650> thing<00:04:42.940> these<00:04:43.940> are<00:04:44.180> kind<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.450> like

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
of pros that used to use them but those

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.050 
of pros that used to use them but those
are<00:04:51.590> kind<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.920> band<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.190> band<00:04:52.640> at<00:04:52.850> some

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
events so you kind of want to be careful

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.500 
events so you kind of want to be careful
with<00:04:55.040> what<00:04:55.100> you're<00:04:55.640> using<00:04:55.850> them<00:04:56.060> on<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.330> don't

sure that if you want control freaks try

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.330 
sure that if you want control freaks try
them<00:05:03.410> out<00:05:03.530> there<00:05:03.740> only<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.950> ten-dollar
