00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 Then boxset staff will have this is the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.650
 next kissed with the light on 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.750
 in the panel already changed chives from the oil already 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 stirred a lot of changed bongo thing 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 damn already did a lot of thing the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 exercise problem change passing to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.740
 Here you are, what happened in this case? 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.740
 here at the workshop 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.590
 so here only the problem in the case in that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.630
 car our team was this one the other 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 faithful to this car inside the filter 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.300
 oil is seeing it has a kind of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 a crosspiece which is thus in that position 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.010
 here stands in the middle in the fear where 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.170
 is hosted so broke and the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.949
 pieces in which broke and this parable 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 here is in the car there on foot joaozinho 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 try to type a ball that looks like this 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.609
 up that does what regulates the pressure 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.030
 of oil 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.280
 then he broke the spring the ball 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.409
 did the fashion went up that she does 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 the oil pressure is not set at 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.840
 every time the car came on the march 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.939
 slow or lose your engine turn to light 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 and look no day and oil chives already 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.009
 had switched to the face spoke oil filter 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 I already changed then we stayed until I saw 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.759
 whatever the problem we took and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 was to remove the filter to find out that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.890
 the problem was this the problem is a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.840
 filter break business in there 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.329
 that crisis was in the middle of the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.799
 filter more or less the broken crosshead 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.979
 get a ticket all and just a plane crashed 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.079
 and she stays in the middle so she does what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.899
 she pushes the ball down 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.000
 the filter enters pushes if the spring 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.950
 stay straight up what goes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.509
 will not regulate the pressure of the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.300
 did not regulate the pressure in the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.330
 teenager told people 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.260
 changed filter put new oil is this 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.260
 solve the problem there
