00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
 Until recently, a modest weather seemed white skype.com's college deficit 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.540
 heeze of 5 percent discount or is the viewers welcome with new ones 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.240
 revival of the road to success 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.790
 a number of people also seemed more than I must say 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.150
 when the series returned 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.490
 I can already test them a bit with the world 108 countries and probably then 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.429
 every now and then a chicken egg problem not as often of course as with someone who is real 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.609
 maybe even if 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.669
 when team on site comes here to see for a month or four or five 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:27.439
 it all worked out 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 the Netherlands will participate 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.259
 probably if cu was designed with the world group the table to the ball could 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.890
 I need some matches in one line 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.769
 but this week 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.510
 Japan rise because this is the end that I know my profile 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.260
 must make 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.859
 and then making beersmans tells a very good project 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.839
 about 80 km type I have to be able to do a project 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.940
 or finish a part of a project 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.149
 and in the end, all the time in the world going to kamperzeedijk is happy 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.129
 met for the rest and all this can make plenty vs there comes a lot of time 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 to record things and there are therefore both parties for a satisfied 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.710
 and then that I basically that we there what 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.490
 he asked for a 0 2 backlog in the back given this man 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.519
 the opposition 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.899
 it just a little from experience real in another good player with usb 100 equal ap 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.200
 roadster like all 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170
 four to five years said in the viva 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.540
 is the viva person's comment 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.480
 she said that he always does not know whether the viva five are still made 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.490
 in the years that i always have a party she is almost always our cows 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 mort a timer that the qualcomm on a draw is more seen that we on one 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.280
 2 2 it does not leave you can still attack 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.149
 in other words, the competition could do so completely inside that it was doing 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.840
 eventually you have a chance to make full use of it here to spread it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.080
 Really came as one of the only people who suspected corruption 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.740
 it is time for me and the 3 2 goal yet I am not everyone was put 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.609
 because everyone has deviated lack of anp attack power 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.210
 the canvas very often if something was not right if something did not want gas masks 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.649
 unchanged immediately could be the sand is the parking garage in Ghent 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.520
 that is why it always makes the peak alpine country a mutandis covenant 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.780
 there are some that will have had some success with that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840
 in the past games they have seen me 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.040
 well I have three points to be delivered so we keep seeing in the corner the 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.500
 so divisions naturally come to triangular opponents 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 and that means that is also a little more force to put in and therefore that is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.429
 also and that will be top with new purchases 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:20.289
 the safe with us before Christmas included and then so live my sancy 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:24.159
 method happen from then I buy a whole lot of new players also a strong one 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.779
 players as the quay tables overlook 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.789
 the tukkers the unique live can do the air conditioning test once that keeps me huge 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.449
 example it will be possible to make cruises vibrating, of course 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.329
 be fantastic 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.979
 you also have to be the chemistry and shot in the most complicated way 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.849
 do not know what keeper was doing it will be that property but it will be beautiful 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.169
 been on a modest from the alderman but this man is not up to that 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.659
 the corrida also see erik well too 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.829
 a very odd one around equity fund I have to comment on is little or too bad 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:53.709
 piss at the top 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650
 that a little fog was the start at the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.169
 emmen active from 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.450
 viva read a bit stupid controlled computer 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.099
 But heat from the ANP three is a competitor that is the exciting ever here 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.069
 directed stupid egmond to send ours twice 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.659
 in the end they could bump freely into the fake mine 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.569
 The city side me due to Kevin Prince Boateng is just that 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.340
 make full use of it 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.540
 but I can do it well but it was silent cackling that not good 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.550
 but yes the red shoes you have known there the most long 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.150
 that would be so but I recognize players never left is always going to be 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.360
 looks at the shoes 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.859
 on to the hague, for example, if and distracted, that is pretty easy to see 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.529
 and after that i can also give players a card with i can just be striking 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.460
 red shoes 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.690
 for this is won three times then this competition was also with four te 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.700
 so have won 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.799
 so far and will see the prospect of the division there 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.130
 optimistic 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.450
 advantageous so I'm just going to play with our bakery cart the team wants 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.610
 if the best sidewalk didn't change the sport I had this player 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.449
 play in the action team direction and very quickly continue a child off the ski slope 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.099
 and we did not know and the security and that three young player I very heavy 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.080
 to get food 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.399
 for the 4 2 2 formation 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:06.589
 on that seems to be very good I have never used myself and that in 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.059
 european circles robben played very well and from experience and the other 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:14.509
 players who played the 4 2 2 were very strong opponents 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.699
 here comes the bushes lopik a knee band oliver balcony he pushed them up 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.499
 equal height 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:24.770
 will it make the fota to my side you try stupid mistake i really 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.940
 unlike the sacred looks at us, these things are the ideas 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.740
 you have to be nonsense if you think of me one aspect of the game is not me 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 so good care that you notice that that is the most important thing what a fact 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.680
 is good that most goals that are likely to go wrong 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.559
 simple foods don't think about getting rid of them 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.389
 for the ball a bit too far but for our Sunday ahead that you are still in between 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.740
 pokot pasta someone who was completely free 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.860
 that will keep bets informed 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.809
 by the way, I don't really have a two or three bath because of a little more or cats 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.940
 the parts was of course on my part I also not all along 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.190
 why do you come with a small tuft also and through the short corner on a 3 3 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.550
 a tie but after that it will eventually be norg in the match 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.780
 and so grab the three points I ad here 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.860
 to make a thorough for me I am suddenly not on us 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.070
 this race was 3 4 and that is the end of the episode 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.140
 koetje liked what was possible to cut a long side at first 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.060
 have not done that 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.100
 appears on two appear on the list and the dogs can both appear 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.180
 see the movie guys 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.580
 the cia hopefully top man
