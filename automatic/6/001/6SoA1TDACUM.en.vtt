00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 my friend was Ã¡lex english are real 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.819
 I study all these subjects if I know 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.620
 who I know there was a man 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.660
 that has a massive particular test 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 where he kept a preserved 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 skeleton of these creatures that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 we will have sirens 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.809
 auditors with 900 good does a couple of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 years ago 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.990
 this person that such a researcher 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 which like the Spanish this one that you 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 you commented on doing research 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.510
 in Greece he discovered a semi-grave 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 let's say it contained a figure of a 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.369
 to be with a tail like a fish when opening 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.140
 went to the underwater tomb of this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.320
 screen when opening this found some 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 bones see him he analyzed them came 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 let's say and in this particular museum that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.270
 the time you spend studying this 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.059
 and he has inside a chest of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.329
 crystal one of these skeletons to the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.280
 moment is the only bone that is not 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.960
 has been able to deny its origin 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.059
 perfect all the others already also of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 all the leaves that clear creature all 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 the others have the peculiarity of 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 that has been discovered that you put yourself are 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.210
 some tricks that mix the tail of a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.580
 be with the spine of another but 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.650
 what we are seeing in the photograph 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.119
 how many of these skeletons has two 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.979
 certain has two of different size 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.890
 but there is one that is bigger and so 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.270
 it is bigger it has human form 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.190
 complete merely human now what 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.409
 you say is that it is a past for the 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.110
 analysis and let's say you do not have to see by 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.850
 no kind of merging two 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.210
 skeletons that do not correspond said have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.190
 made other types of circus simply 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.659
 with these museums the fossil banks 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.000
 of the piltdown man that is also 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.440
 that was exactly armed this one is not 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 still scientists are 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.550
 investigating everything does not reach a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.640
 accurate conclusion that you take your time 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.250
 is genetically say all the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.440
 parts of that creature corresponds 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 only to be clear correspond to the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.740
 same animal 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.649
 clearly what happens is that we say 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.729
 that the second to second only 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.460
 balance is going to be a bit more difficult 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.210
 to find is clearly a human being 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.539
 that instead of his legs his tail his spine 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.390
 dorsal ends in a fish tail 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.129
 something like that or not is one of the many 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.260
 let's say photography or tests that 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.870
 circulate on the Internet regarding people 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.550
 who claim to have let's say the remains of 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.090
 these pups online and human size 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.160
 let's say meters 60 meters 65 is not good 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.290
 I had promised them a video that was 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 of this Spanish that being in waters 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.260
 australian 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.709
 this man investigating all kinds of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.140
 marine creatures manages to see this person 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.030
 that in half human personitas 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.069
 the human part says that it is not 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
 exactly in one person but it is a 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.910
 humanoid clear is not something like with 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.470
 a skin let's say we clearly 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.810
 see how obsessed he was but with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.239
 a part luck a ship this man 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.160
 the next day but the second day of 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.040
 look for an encounter of this creature 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.709
 he achieves it and manages to take a video 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 Man gives the face affirms that I am like this 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.430
 man makes a living, let's say 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.769
 He met us then the man very 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.120
 0 respect are surrounding us and given 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 the level of impact that the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.290
 encounter with this creature desire 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.750
 reveal it and this is the video please 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.540
 to the great recife barrier in australia 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 that's where I live to try a box 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.950
 underwater to shoot underwater that 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.709
 had bought and the movie the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.209
 left was my first attempt ended 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.109
 to get down there and I'm trying 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.290
 operate a camera from outside through 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.200
 from the box and I suddenly feel something 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.480
 behind me and at that moment I see 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.379
 pass this 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
 and my mind thought it was that but 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.330
 before I knew it, I had already 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.250
 gone 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.170
 so I went back the next day to the same 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.420
 place almost exactly at the same 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.420
 par and I waited and waited and this time already 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.610
 He had been there quite a while when 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.140
 soon the vine and there are people there are a lot 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.150
 people who comment not if it seems 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.040
 that you were waiting for it to appear 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.170
 Well, if I was waiting but I did not know 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.630
 if it was going to appear or not 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.489
 but it has appeared and this time I could 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.000
 have perfectly the tail of these two 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:13.630
 mermaids is not the same I have seen this 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.079
 material more than anyone that sure and look 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.350
 the tails is that it is not the same no no 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.360
 they are the same 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.040
 that's why I think these are a group of 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.990
 animals or mermaids that were traveling 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.830
 towards the north towards the tropic and 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.750
 they were there in a moment and then 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.490
 they disappeared because after 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.640
 second day I had to go home and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.500
 when I realized that really the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.710
 material that I had filmed I organized another 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.050
 I traveled a month later and I came back and I was 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.050
 four times more in the same area 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.890
 it was like going through several times it has logic 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.360
 what is what the story really 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.310
 now we try to pick up a bit of the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.870
 beginning of history which is 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.720
 investigating ps through photographs 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.000
 of not spending several hours under the 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.460
 ocean sees that a creature now 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.370
 attention to both times he does 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.080
 emphasize where he has listened when 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.580
 suddenly one is alone in the room and 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.880
 Tkachenko because I felt that someone 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.880
 He is watching 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.960
 but he says he feels that in the 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.210
 window behind someone is watching him 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.860
 if someone is stuck and look awad and 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.930
 this person was scared and sees it not what 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.430
 reaches to record and only grabs 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.040
 when is he going 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.080
 and has that video obsesses so much 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.570
 because he is not clear about what he saw and 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.310
 says ok I saw some mermaid person but 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.250
 obviously it can not be because 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.640
 Mermaids do not exist because it goes the next day 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.930
 and to go to not doubt it captures the image that 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.240
 It is left where clearly 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.550
 see this creature again he is 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.890
 observing he turns around because he has 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.560
 several windows around it and it reaches 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.510
 to see how it moves away as we said as a 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.790
 difference of fish do not have the 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.590
 vertical tail but that way 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.260
 horizontal like the whales and all 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.260
 others like several of the mammals good
