00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 Look here again, youtube crew. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.859
 I'm going to talk about a knife today. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.860
 I'm doing here 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.009
 I just got a letter on the internet telling me 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.830
 letter but it is a car made of resin 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.090
 the resin from fibers to resin that you 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 it moves with fiber that liquid and iporã 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 now I'm going to ride that stretch here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:34.410
 I will explain here common how to do here 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:47.480
 try to explain here 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:47.480
 I put it last night tomorrow 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 enough to see how it is 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:36.170
 and costs on average 15 to 17 person uses 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 catalyst is the product that makes 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.189
 I do not know how to work with you on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.799
 internet and seeks to know how to work 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.540
 So, it's okay, that 's it. I put a 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.600
 Car on this knife, right? 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.939
 the fault also that I heard a plaque 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.130
 one love stainless plate of a polishing it 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:59.640
 There is one more ball show 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.979
 Anyway , it's very resistant. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.990
 Almost almost like granite you were 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.400
 so it gets pretty strong very good 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:13.360
 It's even coming out of resin. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.710
 the catalyst is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.320
 great when an amount you 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.630
 After you learn, you put the cloth 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.500
 on under a plastic place the taba nor 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.820
 it's here right? 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.630
 painted put the taba puts a 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.600
 plastic on it and resin 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.270
 put it on that wendel to 6 in 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.840
 chacao cloth pretty in the residence he 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:47.410
 wet even you stretch here only after 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.890
 that you have wet too much zina you 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:55.060
 layering is chakan all 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.260
 the plans and all the plans you 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 watering is going wet and doing the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.980
 layers remembering what you 're doing 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.140
 the calls and remembered to be photographed 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.330
 makes a slightly larger hole in the cable 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.640
 You can put the knife like this to 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.580
 do not have to put the knife and stack 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.070
 put it like it is watering a 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.510
 memory of the soggy cloth ney and 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.549
 neighbor strawberry 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.010
 ideal is you use a stainless steel bowl 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.600
 out there because you can 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.459
 jump and it's easier, huh? 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.620
 when the economy is still drying in the canister 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.440
 she let you put a plastic 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.700
 hard and I'm not only you boring memory 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.330
 and get another one another classic puts the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.890
 as above will catch the two were 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.390
 about this is how it is here 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.310
 after school will be spent like this 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.940
 two times having here can ride 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:03.190
 ciscel it 's great to know that god these are 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:07.510
 These lawyer tires bought for a thousand 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.269
 and everyone here every day fainting, right? 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.549
 it becomes easier is tighten 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.370
 after putting the liquid of the taba you 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.700
 tightens squeeze money given in very 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.700
 the lessons 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.570
 accent your document 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.610
 I told you to be here, my soul 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.260
 the plastic in the case of the father as soon as 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.780
 end to end here okay okay okay 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:47.440
 plastic placed arise after 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:57.670
 ends up thus extending the other side 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:05:04.810
 has a plastic identified graphic 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:07.240
 photo picture you have is super sure is too much 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.820
 So far you can model knife right 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.060
 here the knife was then 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.760
 cable modeling and will give each 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.120
 them your way right looking on the internet and 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.150
 see photos of knife cord and population 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.450
 she is returning to the truth of the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.570
 video is more to teach because in 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.580
 internet has how to make the cable pm letter 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.200
 huh 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.420
 but it does not have but which is the product that 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.940
 uses understood then galera the product that 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:43.540
 Resin resin and catalyst are the 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.810
 Doing it must be just that Nothing else until 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.810
 for you to jump like this in the end when you 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.490
 elisha chatô always left cent 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.580
 he arrived later in the end he 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.970
 put the waste of water and about 600 for 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.220
 head he uses 1,200 after he does it all 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.050
 That's the model, all right. 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.350
 you put the resin with a little bit 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.590
 Small new mill passes catalyst 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.410
 the finger to organize the cable 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.320
 after this first time you are 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:19.090
 dry after a couple of hours you rubbish 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.310
 again with a 1,200 sandpaper you come from 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.520
 new catalyst that the resin of 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.190
 deolinda is improving the money and goes 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.130
 until the cord is 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.919
 let it dry and you 're ready, it's ugly to knife 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.520
