00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
at the way that this game played out

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.300 
at the way that this game played out
really<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.320> most<00:03:16.440> part<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.770> mean<00:03:16.890> Carmelo

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
really for the most part I mean Carmelo

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
really for the most part I mean Carmelo
Anthony<00:03:17.700> wound<00:03:18.210> up<00:03:18.330> with<00:03:18.480> 20<00:03:18.840> points<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.320> so

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
Anthony wound up with 20 points and so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.160 
Anthony wound up with 20 points and so
did<00:03:19.680> LeBron<00:03:20.270> Deron<00:03:21.270> Williams<00:03:21.420> with<00:03:21.750> 12<00:03:21.990> as

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
did LeBron Deron Williams with 12 as

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.040 
did LeBron Deron Williams with 12 as
well<00:03:22.380> Durant<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:23.040> 16<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:24.330> looking<00:03:24.690> at<00:03:24.870> this

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
well Durant was 16 but looking at this

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.310 
well Durant was 16 but looking at this
game<00:03:25.350> for<00:03:26.220> what<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
game for what it was I think this is the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.020 
game for what it was I think this is the
kind<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.680> game<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.010> know<00:03:29.130> we<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.460> it's<00:03:29.730> almost

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
kind of game you know we but it's almost

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.240 
kind of game you know we but it's almost
like<00:03:30.240> we've<00:03:30.390> become<00:03:30.630> spoiled<00:03:31.110> as<00:03:31.410> basketball

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250

may<00:03:54.600> sound<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:55.170> little<00:03:55.230> bit<00:03:55.650> strange<00:03:56.070> but<00:03:56.340> this

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
may sound a little bit strange but this

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.910 
may sound a little bit strange but this
could<00:03:57.150> actually<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.570> somewhat<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.709> good

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
could actually be somewhat of a good

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
where they were when it comes to

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.960 
where they were when it comes to
shooting<00:05:40.650> threes<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.310> also<00:05:41.610> when<00:05:41.729> it<00:05:41.820> comes

to shooting free throws because normally

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.050 
to shooting free throws because normally
of<00:05:43.650> course<00:05:43.680> it's<00:05:44.460> an<00:05:44.550> old<00:05:44.669> adage<00:05:44.970> in

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
of course it's an old adage in

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.120 
of course it's an old adage in
basketball<00:05:45.450> close<00:05:46.050> games<00:05:46.320> usually<00:05:46.440> come<00:05:46.919> down

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
basketball close games usually come down

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.790 
basketball close games usually come down
to<00:05:47.490> who<00:05:47.729> hits<00:05:48.300> their<00:05:48.720> free<00:05:48.990> throws<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.440> think

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
to who hits their free throws I think

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.110 
to who hits their free throws I think
that<00:05:49.890> this<00:05:49.979> will<00:05:50.100> actually<00:05:50.280> be<00:05:50.610> good<00:05:50.820> for<00:05:50.880> the

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
that this will actually be good for the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.940 
that this will actually be good for the
United<00:05:51.150> States<00:05:51.600> in<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.960> long<00:05:52.140> run<00:05:52.169> and<00:05:52.620> we

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
United States in the long run and we

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.990 
United States in the long run and we
have<00:05:53.100> become<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:53.669> think<00:05:54.000> spoiled<00:05:54.450> as<00:05:54.570> a<00:05:54.750> as<00:05:55.080> a

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
have become I think spoiled as a as a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.370 
have become I think spoiled as a as a
basketball<00:05:57.000> populous<00:05:57.630> if<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:57.990> will<00:05:58.140> in<00:05:58.260> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
basketball populous if you will in the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.920 
basketball populous if you will in the
u.s.<00:05:58.680> when<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.250> comes<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.610> seeing<00:05:59.880> boys<00:06:00.630> just

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
u.s. when it comes to seeing boys just

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.860 
u.s. when it comes to seeing boys just
blow<00:06:01.200> everybody<00:06:01.620> out<00:06:01.710> by<00:06:02.250> 40<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:03.479> in<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
blow everybody out by 40 and in the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.510 
blow everybody out by 40 and in the
games<00:06:04.050> being<00:06:04.289> over<00:06:04.590> by<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.800> midway<00:06:05.250> through

games being over by the midway through
the<00:06:05.550> third<00:06:05.789> quarter<00:06:06.000> so<00:06:06.479> that's<00:06:06.930> just<00:06:07.169> that's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
the third quarter so that's just that's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.710 
the third quarter so that's just that's
just<00:06:07.680> my<00:06:07.890> analysis<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.490> what<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:08.669> think<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:09.180> how

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
just my analysis of what I think of how

just my analysis of what I think of how
the<00:06:09.780> u.s.<00:06:10.260> how<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.310> u.s.<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.729> going<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:11.940> go<00:06:12.060> and

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
the u.s. how the u.s. is going to go and

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.880 
the u.s. how the u.s. is going to go and
how<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.390> think<00:06:12.810> that<00:06:13.200> this<00:06:13.320> will<00:06:13.440> actually<00:06:13.590> be

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
how I think that this will actually be

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.880 
how I think that this will actually be
good<00:06:14.070> for<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.340> u.s.<00:06:14.550> is<00:06:14.729> 99-94<00:06:15.600> close<00:06:16.260> game

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890
