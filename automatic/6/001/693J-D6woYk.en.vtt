00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.100
 I welcome today we will be clean as a 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.339
 he to after the campaign everyone knows about 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.000
 problematic sti carbon steel homeland 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:16.040
 Have you picked up the words for yourself? 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.360
 means repeatedly shown for 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.140
 cleaning dishes of various non-ferrous metals 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:28.580
 i.e. no polishing wheel 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:36.850
 Goi paste just rub it now maples 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.850
 how superfluous memorized chat our tool 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 profusely by blood meme blade 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.119
 and in this state, I probably leave 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:18.380
 Well, for 5 minutes I still know what 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.000
 I literally went from 3 to 6 minutes and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 then I in this means my blade now 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 I have already slightly modified the way 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.359
 cleaning I bought such a brush rather 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.110
 washcloth for this case on 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.679
 will wash the leftovers 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.729
 cleaner hope with him 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.729
 also remove rust 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.810
 I try to be extremely careful because 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.730
 that pecked still after the hike keeps 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 its pretty good sharpness therefore 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980
 guys, I'll probably disconnect now 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.550
 so as not to cut oneself did it all 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 humanly more comfortable in a comfortable 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.160
 position and show perhaps the result 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 generally turned the wedge 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.860
 for let's say at 10 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.490
 let's look at the result of this video 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.980
 shoot or those people for example 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.550
 no polishing paste 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.190
 him and you personally laps but my dremel 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.300
 you would like to have a well-groomed blade 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.880
 for this you can safely use 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.600
 various cleaning products for dishes i 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.860
 went to one asked them 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.770
 huge set do not choose 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.170
 try and personally so here is a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.940
 cleanser substances you can 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.090
 we can find here because 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.170
 I purchased in Israel, but I think that any 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 other cleaner means for various 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:32.260
 metal type like stainless steel sword what 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.390
 here it is also written clean nickel in general 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.900
 any kind of loss even written with 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.110
 any non-ferrous metals but apparently 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.670
 he cleans carbon too well 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.130
 naturally i have on my weaponry and 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.270
 felt circles and core miles naturally 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.330
 Of course, Iâ€™ll go right over here and 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.740
 Dremel with felt circle plus 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.930
 polishing paste paste goi for example 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.800
 and I will use and deauville course 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.970
 a result that will be a little bit 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.020
 more interesting than 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.040
 apparently now apparently problematic 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.440
 the zone is near the cutting edge 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.170
 near the handle near the buster there just 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.730
 it was difficult for me to crawl and near cutting 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.209
 edge i'm just afraid 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.030
 order your fingers but overall you can 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.360
 see what was the beginning of the video and how 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.920
 the blade became after 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.190
 nude 15 polishing in general, I think 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.169
 the result is very acceptable and 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.590
 inexpensive 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.999
 I already use this bottle but I don't know 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.159
 4 years exactly and it is not half the fault 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.319
 empty and either half full but here 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:51.629
 example somewhere so it is fluid that is 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:52.650
 metal will last for a very long time all 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.770
 Thanks for attention 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.770
 it was useful until new meetings
