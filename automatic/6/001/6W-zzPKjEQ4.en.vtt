00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
really matter as long as we're going

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.120 
really matter as long as we're going
away<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.060> our<00:01:12.510> partner<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> creating<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
open line so we have elasticity

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.940 
open line so we have elasticity
from<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.280> collected<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> seven<00:01:19.020> eight

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
from there we collected on seven eight

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.789 
from there we collected on seven eight
and<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.409> sure<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and when one and two and make sure that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.130 
and when one and two and make sure that
we<00:01:25.920> weren't<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> make<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
we weren't going to make it I'm here and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.109 
we weren't going to make it I'm here and
have<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.350> position<00:01:29.009> hold<00:01:29.369> seven<00:01:29.759> hold<00:01:30.030> eight

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
have my position hold seven hold eight

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
have my position hold seven hold eight
then<00:01:30.630> collect

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
then collect

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
then collect
go<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> progressive<00:01:33.360> keep

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
go it was more of a progressive keep

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
go it was more of a progressive keep
building<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.950> energy<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> from<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
building the energy to go from that and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
building the energy to go from that and
it's<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.170> important<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.130> mutual<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it's also important to not be mutual and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's also important to not be mutual and
then<00:01:39.180> develop<00:01:39.659> connection<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.290> rather

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
then develop connection would rather

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
then develop connection would rather
develop<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> connection<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:41.970> develop

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
develop the connection and then develop

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.539 
develop the connection and then develop
the<00:01:42.540> connection<00:01:43.259> even<00:01:43.350> further<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.159> further

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the connection even further and further

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
the connection even further and further
more<00:01:44.880> leaders<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.450> talked<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> not

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
