the<00:01:25.140> helicopter<00:01:25.860> finishes<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the helicopter finishes like this that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.859 
the helicopter finishes like this that
was<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.210> helicopter

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
was a helicopter

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.290 
was a helicopter
motion<00:01:28.649> like<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> produced<00:01:30.149> a

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
motion like this and this produced a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.139 
motion like this and this produced a
high<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.810> high<00:01:31.140> fade<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.880> he<00:01:33.000> had

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
high a high fade there and then he had

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.570

the<00:01:33.300> high<00:01:33.509> fall<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.490> he

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
the high fall up like this and then he

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940 
the high fall up like this and then he
had<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> crossover<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.530> know<00:01:37.649> over

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
had a crossover over here you know over

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.059 
had a crossover over here you know over
here<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.399> way<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> though<00:01:40.350> obviously<00:01:40.890> that's

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
here this way so though obviously that's

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.389 
here this way so though obviously that's
the<00:01:41.190> draw<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.659> high<00:01:42.840> hook<00:01:43.110> high<00:01:44.009> fade

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the draw that's a high hook high fade

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850 
the draw that's a high hook high fade
and<00:01:44.819> then<00:01:44.970> he<00:01:45.060> had<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:46.020> his<00:01:46.200> he<00:01:46.590> had<00:01:46.710> his

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
punch shot like this you know like that

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
punch shot like this you know like that
there's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.290> bunch<00:01:49.530> shot<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.579> he

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there's a bunch shot like that but he

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
there's a bunch shot like that but he
