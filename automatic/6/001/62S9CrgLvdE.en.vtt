00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
changing them because I don't really

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.339 
changing them because I don't really
bright<00:00:10.740> bright<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.309> too<00:00:11.400> much<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.080> maybe<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
bright bright in too much and maybe if I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.350 
bright bright in too much and maybe if I
get<00:00:13.500> two<00:00:13.679> or<00:00:13.710> three<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.190> them<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.460> there<00:00:14.670> it'll

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
get two or three of them in there it'll

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.939 
get two or three of them in there it'll
look<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.690> little<00:00:15.839> bit<00:00:16.049> better<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.920> right

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
look a little bit better but as of right

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040 
look a little bit better but as of right
now<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.490> doesn't<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:17.820> shine<00:00:18.210> much<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
now it doesn't really shine much but I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
now it doesn't really shine much but I
also<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.470> 20%<00:00:20.070> tints<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> can't

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
also have like 20% tints so you can't

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.150 
also have like 20% tints so you can't
really<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:22.890> really

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
really see in them but I'm really

very impressed with the easies we're

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.139 
very impressed with the easies we're
like<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> them<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.710> six<00:00:46.980> dollars<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
like two of them for six dollars are you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
like two of them for six dollars are you
gonna<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.480> take<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.289> bulb<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
connect it with this connector right

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.389 
connect it with this connector right
here<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.649> there<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:57.890> what's<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.190> on

here and there you go what's going on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.900 
here and there you go what's going on
just<00:00:59.969> install<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.539> LEDs<00:01:01.579> see<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.760> up

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
just install these LEDs see them up

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
just install these LEDs see them up
there<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.780> bright<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.890> red<00:01:05.189> one

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there we're pretty bright this red one

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.960 
there we're pretty bright this red one
is<00:01:06.530> not<00:01:07.530> quite<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.130> bright<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> could

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is not quite as bright and you could

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
is not quite as bright and you could
barely<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:09.600> any<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> could

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
barely see any of it so these you could

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.740 
barely see any of it so these you could
see<00:01:11.909> pretty<00:01:12.540> well<00:01:12.799> other<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> did<00:01:14.750> was

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
see pretty well other thing I did was

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.219 
see pretty well other thing I did was
follow<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.500> LED<00:01:17.220> daytime<00:01:17.460> running<00:01:17.729> lights

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.600 

great<00:01:22.229> white

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.410 

there<00:01:27.610> are<00:01:27.729> $30<00:01:28.690> on<00:01:28.870> Amazon<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.729> I<00:01:33.790> am<00:01:34.030> getting

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
there are $30 on Amazon but I am getting

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.030 
there are $30 on Amazon but I am getting
an<00:01:34.540> LED<00:01:34.960> read<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.950> says<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:38.290> attract<00:01:38.830> them

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
an LED read that says that attract them

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100 
an LED read that says that attract them
probably<00:01:39.550> because<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.000> LEDs<00:01:40.390> are<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.960> know

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
probably because the LEDs are you know

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.859 
probably because the LEDs are you know
last<00:01:41.950> voltage<00:01:42.490> or<00:01:42.759> watts<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.450> daytime

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
last voltage or watts and the daytime

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.290 
last voltage or watts and the daytime
running<00:01:43.900> lights<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.520> here's<00:01:45.820> what<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.119> looks

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
running lights and here's what it looks

00:01:46.300 --> 00:02:01.770 
running lights and here's what it looks
like<00:01:46.509> what<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.500> normal<00:01:47.890> lights

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.810 

all<00:02:02.680> night<00:02:03.420> having<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.479> change<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.810> fogs<00:02:05.110> yet

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
all night having to change the fogs yet

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.250 
all night having to change the fogs yet
and<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.940> how<00:02:10.090> bright<00:02:10.330> these<00:02:11.200> lights

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and just like how bright these lights

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.850 
and just like how bright these lights
are<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.010> right<00:02:12.640> there's<00:02:13.569> like<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.500> cars<00:02:14.740> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
are so right there's like the cars I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
are so right there's like the cars I
should<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.069> brighter<00:02:15.340> than<00:02:15.520> what<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.760> could

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
should be brighter than what you could

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.150 
should be brighter than what you could
see<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.450> video<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.010> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
see here in the video and then this is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.900 
see here in the video and then this is
with<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> high<00:02:20.950> beams<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.459> which

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
with the with the high beams on which

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.910 
with the with the high beams on which
are<00:02:22.060> pretty<00:02:22.239> much<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:22.480> shuts<00:02:23.260> off<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> fog

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
are pretty much just shuts off the fog

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.160 
are pretty much just shuts off the fog
lights<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.459> give<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.270> LEDs<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> bit<00:02:25.989> more

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
lights and give the LEDs a bit more

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
lights and give the LEDs a bit more
power

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.060 

you
