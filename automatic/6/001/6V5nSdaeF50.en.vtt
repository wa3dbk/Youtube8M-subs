in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.049> top<00:00:13.290> left<00:00:13.429> where<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.450> these

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
in the top left where we use these

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.080 
in the top left where we use these
keywords<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.890> scrapebox<00:00:17.369> uses<00:00:17.910> these

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
keywords all scrapebox uses these

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380 
keywords all scrapebox uses these
keywords<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.050> find<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.680> bunch<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.189> URLs<00:00:20.400> big

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
keywords to find a bunch of URLs big

keywords to find a bunch of URLs big
lists<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.710> which<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.160> comment

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
these keywords now this is this is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
these keywords now this is this is
amazing<00:01:42.960> stuff<00:01:43.790> now<00:01:44.790> remember<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
amazing stuff now remember that a lot of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
amazing stuff now remember that a lot of
the<00:01:45.840> blogs<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.860> find<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.310> be

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the blogs you will find will be

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
the blogs you will find will be
overlapped<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> keywords<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
overlapped because the keywords are so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
overlapped because the keywords are so
similar<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.520> okay<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.240> want<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
similar that's okay because we want to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
similar that's okay because we want to
extract<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.079> many<00:01:52.409> possible<00:01:53.130> blogs<00:01:53.939> related

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
extract as many possible blogs related

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.410 
extract as many possible blogs related
to<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.750> specific<00:01:55.229> niche<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:56.130> possible<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.329> we

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to our specific niche as possible so we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.100 
to our specific niche as possible so we
did<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.649> 30<00:01:59.490> seconds<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> we're

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
did that in about 30 seconds and we're

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.539 
did that in about 30 seconds and we're
looking<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.710> having<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.670> top<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.299> top<00:02:03.570> right

looking at having up top here top right
223<00:02:05.549> unique<00:02:05.850> keywords<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> really

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
223 unique keywords now if you really

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.309 
223 unique keywords now if you really
want<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.039> crazy<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.170> transfer<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
want to go crazy you can transfer the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.170 
want to go crazy you can transfer the
results<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> keyword<00:02:11.730> list<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
results back to the keyword list and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.309 
results back to the keyword list and
that<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.660> transfer

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that will transfer

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.410 
that will transfer
all<00:02:13.409> these<00:02:13.680> keywords<00:02:13.920> back<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.060> list<00:02:15.239> over

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
all these keywords back to the list over

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.270 
all these keywords back to the list over
here<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.959> then<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.379> could<00:02:16.499> Reese<00:02:16.769> great<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
here and then you could Reese great and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.589 
here and then you could Reese great and
you<00:02:17.370> could<00:02:17.489> literally<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.269> until<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
you could literally do this until you

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.770 
you could literally do this until you
had<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.049> million<00:02:19.499> keywords<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.180> obviously<00:02:21.659> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
had a million keywords and obviously the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.899 
had a million keywords and obviously the
more<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.109> do<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.439> more<00:02:22.700> unrelated<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
more you do it the more unrelated to the

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.459 
more you do it the more unrelated to the
niche<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.239> become<00:02:24.629> but<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.079> really<00:02:25.319> good

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
niche they become but it's a really good

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.170 
niche they become but it's a really good
starting<00:02:25.799> point<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:26.879> going<00:02:26.999> to<00:02:27.030> do

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
starting point so we're not going to do

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.910 
starting point so we're not going to do
that<00:02:27.389> because<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:28.379> know<00:02:28.469> that'll<00:02:28.709> take<00:02:28.739> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that because you know that'll take a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.679 
that because you know that'll take a
couple<00:02:29.129> minutes<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.549> go<00:02:29.730> through<00:02:30.030> we're<00:02:30.569> going

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
couple minutes to go through we're going

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.300 
couple minutes to go through we're going
to<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.930> add<00:02:31.049> these<00:02:31.349> keywords<00:02:31.859> to<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.069> main

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to just add these keywords to the main

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.440 
to just add these keywords to the main
list<00:02:33.139> okay<00:02:34.139> and<00:02:34.409> then<00:02:34.859> we<00:02:34.980> close<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.639> now<00:02:36.209> look

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
list okay and then we close and now look

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.750 
list okay and then we close and now look
we<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> big<00:02:37.139> list<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.560> keywords<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
we have a big list of keywords in the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.190 
we have a big list of keywords in the
main<00:02:38.909> list<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.359> is<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> top<00:02:39.810> left<00:02:40.019> from

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
main list and this is the top left from

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.110 
main list and this is the top left from
and<00:02:40.319> we're<00:02:40.469> looking<00:02:40.769> here<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:41.819> we<00:02:41.969> will

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and we're looking here and so we will

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.110 
and we're looking here and so we will
use<00:02:42.389> this<00:02:42.629> big<00:02:42.959> list<00:02:43.169> of<00:02:43.319> keywords<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:44.189> go<00:02:44.939> and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
use this big list of keywords to go and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.129 
use this big list of keywords to go and
find<00:02:45.389> our<00:02:45.629> URLs<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.919> this<00:02:47.669> we<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.209> save<00:02:48.540> we

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
find our URLs now this we can save we

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.379 
find our URLs now this we can save we
can<00:02:49.290> remove<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.829> duplicates<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.639> remove

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
can remove the duplicates so remove

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.349 
can remove the duplicates so remove
duplicates<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.379> now<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:52.799> down<00:02:52.919> to<00:02:53.359> 147

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
duplicates and now we're down to 147

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.240 
duplicates and now we're down to 147
where<00:02:55.049> we<00:02:55.199> were<00:02:55.290> originally<00:02:55.439> at<00:02:56.569> 223<00:02:58.099> we<00:02:59.099> can

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
where we were originally at 223 we can

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.869 
where we were originally at 223 we can
clear<00:02:59.549> save<00:02:59.969> and<00:03:00.919> import<00:03:01.919> other<00:03:02.129> lists<00:03:02.819> of

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
clear save and import other lists of

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.240 
clear save and import other lists of
keywords<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.049> example<00:03:04.469> if<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.919> ever<00:03:05.069> come

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
keywords so for example if you ever come

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.860 
keywords so for example if you ever come
across<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.549> really<00:03:05.969> fantastic<00:03:06.180> list<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
across a really fantastic list of

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.449 
across a really fantastic list of
keywords<00:03:07.319> that's<00:03:07.560> very<00:03:07.799> diverse<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.189> you

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
keywords that's very diverse and you

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.069 
keywords that's very diverse and you
want<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.699> keep<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.209> might<00:03:09.629> want<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.870> save

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
want to keep it you might want to save

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.649 
want to keep it you might want to save
that<00:03:10.129> but<00:03:11.129> generally<00:03:11.609> you'll<00:03:12.180> come<00:03:12.389> up<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.629> a

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
that but generally you'll come up with a

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.920 
that but generally you'll come up with a
new<00:03:12.959> niche<00:03:13.199> and<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.919> new<00:03:14.159> search<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.299> blogs<00:03:15.569> and
