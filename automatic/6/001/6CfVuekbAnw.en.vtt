00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello guys and girls that welcome you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.620
 once again this channel 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.410
 we are in the kitchen and that means 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.720
 I'm going to make a recipe and make magic 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.540
 with this heart-shaped wand I was going 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.820
 to leave here the recipe made and a cake 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 of square oreo yes because I'm like that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 original the solid ones are round but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 I have to make the cake square 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 and for a change I have also seen a bit 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.579
 thousands of recipes that are without oven and my 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.739
 recipe is color so if you want to see 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.440
 how has this oreo cake done with 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.390
 oven that we're going to watch the video the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.400
 ingredients for this tartar I are two 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.650
 cookie packages oreo one for the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.010
 base and another to decorate 100 grams of 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.010
 White or brown sugar 2 tubs 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 cream cheese Philadelphia a little bit 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 of margarine and 4 large eggs that are 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.710
 generous 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.870
 what we will do is separate the cookies 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.730
 let's separate what is the cookie from the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.039
 cream filling that has what 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.159
 we will use now do not worry and 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.500
 here is what the cookie is like you see 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.700
 Well, the typical mystery is no more 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.220
 Oreo biscuit of all life though 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 be white label in a glass I'll 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.070
 put what would be half the glass of 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 melted butter what is now 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.939
 solid I'm going to put it to defrost as 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.479
 I always do to stay 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.509
 totally liquid this this usually 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.940
 I do not usually measure how much I usually throw 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.460
 about three tablespoons of butter 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.740
 big tablespoons and I put it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.899
 melt in the microwave while going 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.330
 descojonando in the microwave the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.429
 butter let's prepare the mold 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.799
 because I'm going to unmold it from here 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.500
 then what I have done is 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.990
 put a little albal paper 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.660
 and now what I'm going to do is put a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.090
 little oil and a little flour 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.370
 with the melted butter and we're going 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.300
 to throw in everything that is the cookie 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.820
 ground to make the base of the cake 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:10.880
 we will make a pastita 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.320
 of biscuit that will be the base of the cake 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.960
 like a pasta like black chocolate 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.850
 burned but it's cookie so we're going 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.850
 to put on the base of the cake 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.570
 we mix the four eggs 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.310
 we have a little bit and now we are going to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.709
 enter the 100 grams of sugar 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.640
 we add now the creame of the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.640
 oreo cookies 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.500
 and the 2 tubs of Philadelphia cheese 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.360
 we remove all this good mix to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.060
 I've had to beat it but let's go 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.970
 the mixture would remain so and so 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.210
 we will incorporate the mold 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.640
 that we had here to repair what 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.640
 so we throw to the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 distributing it 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.840
 and we will introduce it to the mini horn 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.290
 that you already know that I have 180 degrees 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.850
 for 40 minutes good after 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.690
 be an hour at about 240 degrees this is 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.700
 the aspect is totally enchanted 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.260
 put a knife to check that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.050
 I was totally done and as you can see 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.560
 it comes out clean so it would be good 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.970
 I'm going to let it cool down and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.330
 Then he sees it put in the fridge and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.310
 tomorrow I continue with the final decoration a 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.470
 Once it's already cold after being 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.110
 enough time in the sweat and peak we go 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.750
 to unmold it and we're going to put it in 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.730
 the final site now we take a 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.600
 bowl and put a little cream to 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.090
 ride has to have a percentage of 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.070
 35 milligrams of fat and we're going to 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.810
 beat until it gets thick and 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.600
 we add a little icing sugar 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.290
 will keep this stabilized 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.090
 now that the cream then does not go 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.190
 melting we're going to decorate a little bit 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.890
 what is the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.280
 cake with a very small layer of cream 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.740
 assembled and we put on top the dust of 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.570
 Oreo biscuit that has left us of 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.170
 our package I told you we were going 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.030
 to use two we are decorating as more 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.100
 we like it 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.190
 and now with the whipped cream, let's go 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.230
 making little flowers by putting 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.560
 a small decoration 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.510
 we put a couple of churritos about six or 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.150
 seven and above we put a piece of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.850
 cookie I prayed that we have to do with what 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.770
 let's go over the cake so go 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 putting the decoration that we like 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.910
 this is simply an idea and then 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.070
 also what you can do is if you do not 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.900
 look how the edges have been 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.560
 put a little more whipped cream and 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.870
 put half an Oreo cookie 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.700
 this way as I'm teaching from 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.680
 This way tapara a little ugly that 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.630
 is left and so would be the result I hope 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.460
 that you have liked to subscribe leave 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.460
 no comment and especially try it 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.620
 but not 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.510
 from barinas 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.110
 ah 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.650
 I'm going through a piece
