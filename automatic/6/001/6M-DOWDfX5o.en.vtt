multiple attacks so I'm going to go for
that<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.400> give<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.640> bit<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.909> boost<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.780> and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
that and give it a bit of a boost up and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.180 
that and give it a bit of a boost up and
we<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.680> some<00:01:50.860> more<00:01:51.250> damage<00:01:52.090> controls<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.130> I

we have some more damage controls so I

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.460 
we have some more damage controls so I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
and then this increases the speed on

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.190 
and then this increases the speed on
this<00:01:58.240> side<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.000> melee<00:02:01.330> skills<00:02:01.690> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
side here we have the breaking defenses

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.870 
side here we have the breaking defenses
level<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:19.770> going<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.550> go<00:02:20.700> for

level one so this is I'm going to go for

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
level one so this is I'm going to go for
that<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> we've<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.120> some<00:02:24.660> more

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
that one and so we've got some some more

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.580 
that one and so we've got some some more
options<00:02:25.920> here<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.940> an<00:02:27.060> air<00:02:27.300> soap<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.440> can

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
options here so an air soap so you can

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.710 
options here so an air soap so you can
this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> thing<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> ninja<00:02:30.390> theory<00:02:30.570> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
this is the thing that ninja theory of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.350 
this is the thing that ninja theory of
added<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.530> more<00:02:31.860> combinations<00:02:32.640> rather

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
added in is more combinations rather

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.210 
added in is more combinations rather
than<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.570> tackling<00:02:33.900> triangle<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
than just tackling triangle if you do a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.650 
than just tackling triangle if you do a
little<00:02:35.340> delay<00:02:35.760> between<00:02:36.000> some<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.390> them<00:02:36.540> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
little delay between some of them you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.730 
little delay between some of them you
will<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:36.870> extra<00:02:37.290> options<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:40.350> then<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.620> have

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
will get extra options and then we have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.010 
will get extra options and then we have
Bob<00:02:40.950> affair<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.880> his<00:02:41.970> range<00:02:42.300> skills<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
Bob affair we have his range skills so

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.680 
Bob affair we have his range skills so
this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.320> his<00:02:43.470> attack<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.250> blasted<00:02:44.690> max

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
this is his attack for this blasted max

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.040 
this is his attack for this blasted max
out<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:45.959> out<00:02:46.820> blast<00:02:47.820> skill<00:02:48.209> levels<00:02:48.510> increases

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
out on out blast skill levels increases

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
out on out blast skill levels increases
the<00:02:49.170> amount<00:02:49.230> he<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.680> cheat<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> I've<00:02:51.600> done

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the amount he can cheat so I've done

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.150 
the amount he can cheat so I've done
that<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.050> level<00:02:52.230> 1<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.440> 2<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.860> means<00:02:53.070> you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that for level 1 and 2 so that means you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.580 
that for level 1 and 2 so that means you
can<00:02:53.310> shoot<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> lot<00:02:53.970> more<00:02:54.290> after<00:02:55.290> hope<00:02:55.410> we

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
can shoot now a lot more after hope we

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.440 
can shoot now a lot more after hope we
can<00:02:55.830> use<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> grappling<00:02:56.400> target<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.600> pull<00:02:57.780> board

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
can use a grappling target to pull board

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.820 
can use a grappling target to pull board
target<00:03:00.450> acquired<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.530> that's<00:03:02.490> more<00:03:02.820> um

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
target acquired which is that's more um

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.250

use of his weapons there and then we

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.100 
use of his weapons there and then we
have<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:08.030> blast<00:03:09.030> increases<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> rate<00:03:10.080> of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
have here blast increases the rate of
