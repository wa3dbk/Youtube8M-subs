that I hope it's used for is that

healing<00:02:29.569> feels<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.140> don't<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
healing feels I don't think that the

my boredom but it was just interesting
that<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.560> fight<00:03:24.799> like<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.070> which<00:03:25.459> had<00:03:25.609> been

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
that a fight like that which had been

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.050 
that a fight like that which had been
quite<00:03:26.030> challenging<00:03:26.200> before<00:03:27.340> now<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.760> seemed

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
quite challenging before now just seemed

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.990 
quite challenging before now just seemed
to<00:03:29.480> be<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.900> one-button<00:03:30.350> spam<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.190> don't<00:03:31.790> expect

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
to be a one-button spam I don't expect

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.490 
to be a one-button spam I don't expect
to<00:03:32.180> see<00:03:32.299> that<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.510> warlords<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.019> draenor

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
to see that in warlords of draenor

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.110 
to see that in warlords of draenor
because<00:03:33.829> as<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.010> say<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.459> design<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
because as I say the design that the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.840 
because as I say the design that the
encounters<00:03:35.570> are<00:03:35.690> designed<00:03:36.109> for<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:37.489> way<00:03:37.640> that

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
encounters are designed for the way that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.670 
encounters are designed for the way that
the<00:03:37.970> incoming<00:03:38.329> damage<00:03:38.630> patterns<00:03:39.140> will<00:03:39.350> change

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
the incoming damage patterns will change

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.410 
the incoming damage patterns will change
in<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> way<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.310> our<00:03:40.459> classes<00:03:40.880> are<00:03:40.910> set<00:03:41.180> up

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
in the way that our classes are set up

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.840 
in the way that our classes are set up
so<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.230> main<00:03:42.380> thing<00:03:42.410> after<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.579> what<00:03:43.760> do

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
so the main thing after this is what do

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.310 
so the main thing after this is what do
