what's up madam players man in town 24-7

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.460 
what's up madam players man in town 24-7
here<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:05.370> part<00:00:05.790> three<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.270> my<00:00:06.660> scrambling

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
here with part three of my scrambling

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.790 
here with part three of my scrambling
guide<00:00:07.799> as<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.139> defense

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
guide as you see right here the defense

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.360 
guide as you see right here the defense
has<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.519> QB<00:00:12.120> spies<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.590> method<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.070> we

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
has two QB spies and the method that we

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060 
has two QB spies and the method that we
use<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.940> make<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.389> spies<00:00:15.750> miss<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.650> not

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
use to make the spies miss is not

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.120 
use to make the spies miss is not
working<00:00:17.940> as<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.720> see<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.320> trying<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.800> roll

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
working as you see I'm trying to roll

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
working as you see I'm trying to roll
out<00:00:20.460> trying<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> make<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> play<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.410> he<00:00:22.800> just

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
out trying to make a play and he just

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
out trying to make a play and he just
comes<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> makes<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> tackle<00:00:24.720> army<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
comes up and makes the tackle army so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
comes up and makes the tackle army so
now<00:00:26.099> we're<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> try<00:00:26.849> another<00:00:27.060> method<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
now we're going to try another method to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.320 
now we're going to try another method to
make<00:00:28.320> both<00:00:28.859> spies<00:00:29.220> miss<00:00:29.640> run<00:00:29.880> all<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> way<00:00:30.179> out

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
make both spies miss run all the way out

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.470 
make both spies miss run all the way out
the<00:00:30.840> third<00:00:31.080> method<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.800> get<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.700> yards<00:00:33.360> in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the third method and we get two yards in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
the third method and we get two yards in
a<00:00:33.600> hip<00:00:33.960> stick<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> very

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a hip stick so that's not a very

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
a hip stick so that's not a very
effective<00:00:36.030> method<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.290> now

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
effective method that we want to use now

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.630 
effective method that we want to use now
and<00:00:38.550> try<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> swerve<00:00:39.420> again<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.640> wiccaning

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and try to swerve again and wiccaning

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
and try to swerve again and wiccaning
yards<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.450> only<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.870> three<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> four<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
yards but only about three to four and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
yards but only about three to four and
we<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.550> getting<00:00:44.700> tackled<00:00:45.210> by<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> linebacker

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we are getting tackled by a linebacker

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
we are getting tackled by a linebacker
that's<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.879> swerve<00:00:48.629> one

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that's not we want to do I swerve one

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.799 
that's not we want to do I swerve one
spot<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> other<00:00:50.280> spot<00:00:50.730> comes<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> make

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
spot and the other spot comes up to make

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.270 
spot and the other spot comes up to make
a<00:00:51.840> hit<00:00:52.289> stick<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.180> easy

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
a hit stick so what are we gonna do easy

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.599 
a hit stick so what are we gonna do easy
you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.550> making<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.510> spies<00:00:57.960> miss<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.829> easier

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you can making two spies miss is easier

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
you can making two spies miss is easier
than<00:00:59.640> making<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.629> miss<00:01:01.050> literally<00:01:01.829> all<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
than making one miss literally all you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.719 
than making one miss literally all you
want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.420> run<00:01:03.840> forward<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.799> split<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
want to do is run forward and split the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.649 
want to do is run forward and split the
spies<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:09.210> not

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
spies that is all you have to do do not

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.289 
spies that is all you have to do do not
overthink<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> do

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
overthink it that is all you have to do

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.230 
overthink it that is all you have to do
is<00:01:12.600> run<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> middle<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> QB<00:01:14.880> spies

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
is run in the middle of the QB spies

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.020 
is run in the middle of the QB spies
just<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> large<00:01:17.340> gap<00:01:17.790> in

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
just like that you see that large gap in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
just like that you see that large gap in
between<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.869> run<00:01:19.170> straight<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
between them just run straight up the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.460 
between them just run straight up the
middle<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.689> make<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> play

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
middle and they will not make it a play

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
middle and they will not make it a play
on<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.950> easy<00:01:23.270> simple<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.080> even<00:01:25.229> have

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
on you easy simple you don't even have

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
on you easy simple you don't even have
to<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.340> elite<00:01:26.700> speed<00:01:27.240> quarterback<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to have any elite speed quarterback to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
to have any elite speed quarterback to
do<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> once<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.180> start<00:01:30.509> making<00:01:30.750> two

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
do this and once you start making two

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.609 
do this and once you start making two
spies<00:01:31.650> miss<00:01:32.189> I've<00:01:32.490> seen<00:01:33.090> some<00:01:33.420> people<00:01:33.750> may<00:01:33.960> put

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
spies miss I've seen some people may put

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
spies miss I've seen some people may put
three<00:01:34.920> spies<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.540> opponent

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
three spies out there if your opponent

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
three spies out there if your opponent
puts<00:01:37.409> three<00:01:37.710> spots<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> field

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
puts three spots out there on the field

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.560 
puts three spots out there on the field
you<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.320> won<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> battle<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:42.090> means<00:01:42.360> he

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you have won the battle that means he

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
you have won the battle that means he
has<00:01:42.720> three<00:01:43.170> guys<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.369> focus<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
has three guys just to focus on you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
has three guys just to focus on you
scrambling<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.009> should<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.490> able<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
scrambling and you should be able to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
scrambling and you should be able to
pass<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> run<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.649> opponent

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
pass and run on your opponent

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
pass and run on your opponent
effectively<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.110> saying<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
effectively but as I was saying this is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
effectively but as I was saying this is
one<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.430> easier<00:01:54.000> methods<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.500> making

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
one of the easier methods is just making

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.480 
one of the easier methods is just making
two<00:01:56.399> spies<00:01:56.820> messages<00:01:57.780> run<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.890> middle<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
two spies messages run in the middle of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
two spies messages run in the middle of
both<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.090> spies<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.770> hope<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
both the spies so I really hope that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760
