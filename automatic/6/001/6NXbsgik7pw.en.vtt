00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 but let's go to the kitchen what do you think 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.880
 if he taught him how to prepare little ones 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.240
 jalapenos wrapped in woolton sheet 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.179
 these are filled is what comes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.010
 being the chorizo ​​and a little bit of that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 are the ingredients are going to be happening 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.109
 down the screen so let them pass 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.730
 the ingredients as you see I do not have 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.289
 assistant to the little one in which there 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 because who understands doing what 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 they sent to do something but we're going to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 start with the instructions of the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 chiles and peppers are not going to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 preparing and nothing as well fill 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 and wrap them we have to cure them and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.790
 to cure them these are the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.090
 inscriptions we need 3 pans 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.149
 all have about 6 cups water 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.460
 first pan carries vinegar then 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.070
 we put the first pan vinegar 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.320
 to the second pan we are going to put 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.480
 and the 3rd pot we are going to put 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.490
 sugar there come the amounts for 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.290
 that you will notice then what 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.390
 let's do to open them is cut 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.390
 all the tail then in half 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.410
 of the ingredients and all the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.790
 instructions he told people 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.010
 that are seeing us that the Chileans 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.330
 we can wrap and start filling 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.550
 more and as they are 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.440
 you have to cure the first ones then for 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.150
 cure them finish their actions we have 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.040
 three pans with almost six cups of 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.290
 water to each one I put an ingredient 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.660
 the first pans in that order that 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.520
 takes vinegar the second takes salt and the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.369
 third takes sugar this is like classes 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.050
 of chemistry and here if anything very well 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.030
 then we are silent to cut them 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.310
 jalapeño chiles en gota after I finish 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.040
 to make an incision but my scalpel 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.350
 for everything in the vote part to the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.050
 surface and then very carefully to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.530
 me for example nothing ever happens to me in 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.570
 the fingers 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 when I eat chilies or when I'm 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 removing it looks though very 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.360
 sensitive especially in the yolks of the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:10.390
 fingers if you are very sensitive for this 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 and the eyes 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.780
 If you have small children or large children, 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.090
 I grabbed their face because 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459
 touching them causes them a reaction 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.239
 they turn red then you better use 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.010
 galeno exactly gloves chili 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.840
 very well then now what I'm going to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.269
 do with a teaspoon of coffee is 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.220
 remove veins and seeds in this way 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.920
 not just very carefully removing 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.599
 the face because if it does not come very close to him 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.269
 cubito del cine they jump the face or in 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.170
 the eyes and it already smells really well tried 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.110
 remove it 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.599
 outside and dwindling 901 city currently 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.190
 already requires the seeds and that's why 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.930
 one or the other and it costs work does not happen 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 nothing because in this process you are going to 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.129
 go falling because then there are two 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.959
 chiles we have the dozen then they 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.910
 we removed as I just told you and what 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.269
 we put in the first pan that is the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.430
 which has exactly then first 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.860
 step is water in vinegar are already in the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.680
 water with vinegar the water is going well 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.170
 and I'll tell you 5 minutes from 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.460
 that the water breaks boil right now I do not 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.650
 I will tell you the 5 minutes because 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.290
 then nothing will happen to him but 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.570
 now that I break the boil with them 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.150
 chill five minutes but do these 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.010
 five minutes we rescued the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.540
 Chilean is going to look like this and you will see a 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.180
 little softer and will start losing 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.840
 the green tone we go to the second 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.890
 pan all the peppers 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.459
 exactly counted from that 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:45.430
 break and set aside because the water is fine 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 hot after the second pan 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.160
 rescued and summers with the third 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:56.910
 saucepan that you have has sugar and 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.910
 there the same 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.260
 we're going to leave it the same as we did in the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.139
 another procedure from which 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.120
 break it in five minutes we rescued it 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.620
 and we have some chiles like the ones I 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.099
 I have not distan that they are how we respond 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.859
 purchase in can to add the only thing 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.259
 I was cured was going to give them some 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.690
 prudence is a trade that they are not going to 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.889
 chop but if the dead thing does not 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.889
 I'm going to die 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.000
 today's class was how to cure the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.110
 chiles the reindeer is simpler can 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.389
 reign the for example with a cheese 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.710
 cream and mango or for example me that for 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.710
 cut did that 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.669
 it does not matter so much what is important is 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.710
 lower the conscience to the faithful because 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.720
 so that they are very good food are already 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.330
 then cured and I'll fill it 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.750
 then with how I quoted that if I 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.750
 oaxaca 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.260
 not because you want them football 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.530
 in a context like the others 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.280
 chorizos perfect good sausage 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.810
 so now we have the leaves of 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.810
 indigent wonton 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.630
 in this kitchen very well the leaves of 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.180
 walton we are going to give you a bit of bud 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.950
 Egg nothing else to run did not 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.780
 the risk of them opening when I am 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.060
 in the painting is generally 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.980
 with water, it peels, but I do not 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.420
 I like a water tablet because out there 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.550
 the filling in teachers to the 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.500
 hopper I prefer to make sure that 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.150
 be well stuck telling a little 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.640
 I already have the chile relleno 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.680
 then depending on the size if 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.600
 they reach to close with one of the moons or 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.770
 the leaflet of how much is enough if not 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.850
 then we use two I put it like that 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.020
 that you can drown us and this 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.370
 celebrity copada 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.370
 concentrated the ball 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.229
 good because I'm meaningful all my 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.229
 senses 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.250
 special 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.390
 is my grandfather 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.620
 I just came back with two leaves because 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.940
 around here a hole and if this comes out 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.160
 the cheese is going to start jumping 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.070
 oil then with the same sheet 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.560
 woolton and took a little test 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.630
 too much bubble is perfect and what 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.460
 I have to do is immerse it and take care of it 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.690
 until I brown this will last a quick one 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.400
 Once the track is hot 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.170
 important that it's hot because 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.420
 is the oil is when they absorb fat 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.160
 with a lot of fat also hot oil 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.320
 always do your provided with a little bit 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.580
 flour with a little bread always 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.050
 do not bubble and enough 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.550
 hot to start frying 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.720
 that there is nothing else I have to be 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.750
 taking care because it's all were fast 15 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:03.120
 minutes now but quickie 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:05.540
 take care of me because you can go take 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.540
 the plate 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.810
 surprise 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.110
 to see that he discovers land he no longer has 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.930
 because I'm going to give them 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.350
 to the heart and there goes the phrase of the day 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.170
 the only person you need in your 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:29.730
 life is one that shows that you 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.730
 you need in yours 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:43.779
 I have
