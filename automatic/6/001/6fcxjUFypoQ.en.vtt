take<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.879> up<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.150> little<00:02:28.300> bit

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
take that up a little bit

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:38.750 
take that up a little bit
a<00:02:29.720> place<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.440> there

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600 

so<00:02:39.150> right<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:39.540> we'll<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:40.080> reset<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
so right now we'll just reset it up for

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.460 
so right now we'll just reset it up for
a<00:02:41.640> new<00:02:41.819> link<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.239> two<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.690> show<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> how<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> set

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
a new link or two to show you how to set

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.830 
a new link or two to show you how to set
the<00:02:43.590> machine<00:02:43.709> on

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.330 

and<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.080> new<00:02:49.230> length<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> tubing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and the new length of tubing

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.940 
and the new length of tubing
this<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.360> be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.949 

now<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:57.640> these<00:02:57.790> supported<00:02:58.390> snowboard<00:02:58.840> eyes

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
now with these supported snowboard eyes

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.410 
now with these supported snowboard eyes
to<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> dimension<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.280> want<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.880> need<00:03:01.270> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
to get the dimension I want I need to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.790 
to get the dimension I want I need to
subtract<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> quarter<00:03:02.709> inches

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
subtract for a quarter inches

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.309 
subtract for a quarter inches
to

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.619 

so<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> will<00:03:09.250> place<00:03:09.549> my<00:03:09.730> tape<00:03:09.969> measure<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.390> here

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
so I will place my tape measure in here

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.210 
so I will place my tape measure in here
and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.040 
and
six<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.090> three<00:03:13.390> eight

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.440 

they'll<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.920> readjust<00:03:17.130> my<00:03:17.580> rollers<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.300> I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
they'll have to readjust my rollers as I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.710 
they'll have to readjust my rollers as I
do<00:03:18.510> this

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.750 

especially<00:03:24.440> because<00:03:24.530> this<00:03:24.800> is<00:03:25.010> longer<00:03:25.490> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
especially because this is longer I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.450 
especially because this is longer I
could<00:03:25.970> set<00:03:26.210> this<00:03:26.420> up

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.010 

to<00:03:29.610> get<00:03:29.820> my<00:03:29.970> six<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:30.450> three<00:03:30.660> eighths

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.740 

reposition<00:03:35.020> my<00:03:35.170> wall

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.600

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
so now I want to set this for the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.740 
so now I want to set this for the
forward<00:03:40.000> motion<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.990> I<00:03:41.020> will<00:03:41.320> move<00:03:41.470> my<00:03:41.680> face

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.470 

wanna<00:03:57.260> set<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.590> up

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
wanna set it up

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.390 
wanna set it up
so<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> we<00:03:59.840> do<00:04:00.020> just<00:04:00.349> get<00:04:00.650> our<00:04:00.800> party<00:04:01.220> though
