boiling<00:01:56.840> blood<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.290> stack<00:01:57.560> duration<00:01:58.040> DK

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
boiling blood for the stack duration DK

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.300 
boiling blood for the stack duration DK
times<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.880> doesn't<00:01:59.120> decay<00:01:59.750> as<00:01:59.900> fast<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:01.130> is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
times so doesn't decay as fast this is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.480 
times so doesn't decay as fast this is
for<00:02:01.490> reload<00:02:01.700> speed<00:02:02.000> per<00:02:02.150> stack<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:04.100> had<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> 1

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
for reload speed per stack and I had a 1

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.340 
for reload speed per stack and I had a 1
point<00:02:04.670> extra<00:02:05.120> so<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.360> just<00:02:05.570> doing<00:02:05.780> blood<00:02:05.960> ocean

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
point extra so I just doing blood ocean

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.050 
point extra so I just doing blood ocean
it's<00:02:06.680> barely<00:02:07.130> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> help<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> bite<00:02:07.790> but

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
it's barely going to help the bite but

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.840 
it's barely going to help the bite but
it<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.420> actually<00:02:08.959> beneficial<00:02:09.759> compared<00:02:10.759> to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
it is actually beneficial compared to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.309 
it is actually beneficial compared to
anything<00:02:11.060> else<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> skill<00:02:11.870> tree<00:02:11.990> nothing

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
anything else in the skill tree nothing

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.210 
anything else in the skill tree nothing
else<00:02:12.470> really<00:02:12.710> well

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
else really well

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.360 
else really well
so<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> only<00:02:14.660> point<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.290> had<00:02:15.950> there

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
so it's the only point that I had there

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.580 
so it's the only point that I had there
so<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.880> threw<00:02:17.030> right<00:02:17.180> there

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
so I just threw right there

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.100 
so I just threw right there
empty<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.710> rage<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.160> melee<00:02:19.400> damage<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:20.110> braced

the pain for fire rate and also the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.640 
the pain for fire rate and also the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
shield recharge delay which is nice from

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.070 
shield recharge delay which is nice from
melee<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.700> plus<00:02:26.330> all<00:02:26.540> these<00:02:26.660> skills<00:02:26.930> kind

melee so and plus all these skills kind
of<00:02:27.230> suck<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:27.980> build<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.520> didn't<00:02:28.790> use

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
of suck for this build so we didn't use

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.480 
of suck for this build so we didn't use
those<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.740> for<00:02:30.860> an<00:02:30.950> extra<00:02:31.010> health

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
those this is just for an extra health

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.660 
those this is just for an extra health
if<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> melee<00:02:32.510> kill<00:02:32.720> on<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> bots<00:02:33.050> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
if you get the melee kill on the bots I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.710 
if you get the melee kill on the bots I
redeem<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.820> soul<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.300> important

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
redeem the soul this is important

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.570 
redeem the soul this is important
because<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.020> get<00:02:36.110> 50%<00:02:36.470> more<00:02:36.770> 5p<00:02:37.190> live<00:02:37.340> time

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
because you get 50% more 5p live time

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.350 
because you get 50% more 5p live time
which<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.880> nice

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
which is nice

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.870 
which is nice
this<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.410> faction<00:02:39.800> melee<00:02:40.010> damage<00:02:40.190> per<00:02:40.550> stack

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
this is faction melee damage per stack

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960 
this is faction melee damage per stack
and<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.530> for<00:02:42.740> 500%<00:02:43.400> more<00:02:43.490> melee<00:02:43.820> damage

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
and this is for 500% more melee damage

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.490 
and this is for 500% more melee damage
it's<00:02:44.300> important<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:44.780> killing<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.110> bots<00:02:45.290> like

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's important for killing the bots like

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.960 
it's important for killing the bots like
I<00:02:45.530> said<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.830> million<00:02:46.010> times<00:02:46.160> already<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.760> so

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
I said a million times already it so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.740 
I said a million times already it so
very<00:02:47.810> useful<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.120> then<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.600> that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
very useful and then this is so that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.699 
very useful and then this is so that
when<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.959> kill<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.200> bots<00:02:51.350> you're<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
when you kill the bots you're going to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.370 
when you kill the bots you're going to
get<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:52.030> higher<00:02:53.030> chance<00:02:53.330> applies<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.290> high

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
get a higher chance applies like to high

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.780 
get a higher chance applies like to high
peers<00:02:54.680> which<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.040> important<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.580> fight

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
peers which is important for this fight

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.670 
peers which is important for this fight
you<00:02:56.600> don't<00:02:56.690> really<00:02:56.870> need<00:02:57.110> slag<00:02:57.440> you're

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
you don't really need slag you're

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.060 
you don't really need slag you're
literally<00:02:57.920> gonna<00:02:58.190> kill<00:02:58.340> them<00:02:58.520> pretty<00:02:58.850> fast<00:02:59.270> so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
literally gonna kill them pretty fast so

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.680 
literally gonna kill them pretty fast so
it's<00:03:01.070> kind<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.640> optionally<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.420> need<00:03:02.570> that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it's kind of optionally if you need that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.510 
it's kind of optionally if you need that
or<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.740> I<00:03:03.800> really<00:03:04.040> didn't<00:03:04.250> want<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.430> use

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
or not but I really didn't want to use

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.040 
or not but I really didn't want to use
this<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.240> puts<00:03:05.420> yourself<00:03:05.720> on<00:03:05.840> fire

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
this because it puts yourself on fire

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.930 
this because it puts yourself on fire
and<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.650> will<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.160> will<00:03:07.220> basically<00:03:07.400> apply

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
and that will that will basically apply

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.790 
and that will that will basically apply
a<00:03:07.970> damage<00:03:08.390> over<00:03:08.540> time<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.930> yourself<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.470> make

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
a damage over time to yourself and make

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.410 
a damage over time to yourself and make
it<00:03:09.920> harder<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:10.550> survive<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.390> I

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
it harder to actually survive so I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.220 
it harder to actually survive so I
didn't<00:03:11.780> want<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.610> extra<00:03:14.230> melee

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
didn't want that this is for extra melee

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.130 
didn't want that this is for extra melee
damage<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:17.300> is<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.630> for<00:03:17.720> extra<00:03:17.930> mag

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
damage and this is just for extra mag

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.690 
damage and this is just for extra mag
sides<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.620> fire<00:03:18.769> rate<00:03:18.950> which<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.310> always<00:03:19.459> nice

and with no waist-high periods but the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.620 
and with no waist-high periods but the
thing<00:05:17.490> is<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.849> know<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.000> have<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.360> kind<00:05:18.510> of

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
thing is you know you have to kind of

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.969

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
quit and then do it again so using the

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.719 
quit and then do it again so using the
minions<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.800> little<00:05:23.130> bit<00:05:23.220> more<00:05:23.400> efficient

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
minions is a little bit more efficient

minions is a little bit more efficient
so<00:05:23.849> you<00:05:23.909> don't<00:05:24.030> have<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.180> run<00:05:24.330> back<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.599> every
