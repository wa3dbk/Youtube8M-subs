00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 with you slayer and you watch one more 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 video that was made for the day 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.470
 tankman when many of you, I just 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.289
 same 5 cars that have not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.769
 rolling out to beat them 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 x5 raid and the most pleasant thing is enough 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.930
 many many fights and many machines 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
 pleasant, I would like because usually 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 a lot of nice machines not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 rolling out because you have to do 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 Kaida need to shoot reviews need 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 pumping cars and so on there for 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 examples about two months ago I bought 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.370
 sex than 2 is premium artillery them 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.399
 to british people and still even to her 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 the crew didn't buy it because it just didn't 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.690
 when she has no time to do it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.379
 roll out such more pressing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.980
 tasks that require more 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.239
 activity requires resources and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.760
 accordingly, exactly the same here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.560
 attitude and t49 is taking shape unfortunately 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 in general, probably the first fight for 2 or 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.759
 three months to 49 rolling out and therefore how 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.030
 see I can not adapt immediately 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.280
 projectile flight barrel and this causes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.290
 some ferry to taste canned 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.390
 only him and you will see that preemption 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.400
 you can not immediately determine exactly how 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.049
 take the lead 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 it is normal that is usually one 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.740
 two three fights need to get used to the car 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.030
 to understand the speed of the projectile 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 plus of course wbr and you shouldn't either 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.000
 allows here just what I escaped from than 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 wash flops on c4 c4 by the way great 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.299
 apparatus 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.659
 but I remember that he has recharge 66 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.909
 seconds and I'm 276 so I have enough time 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.310
 imagine him stuffing while he's on 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.460
 recharging cheeks with me enough time 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 and shoot and run while the situation 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.170
 it is not in our favor how are you 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:20.739
 understand it temporarily t49 starts 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.470
 I take my notice T1 heavy shoot 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.319
 not flew ator for about single 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.940
 art of him like a scalar paws they apparently I 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.680
 too long here I am by the way 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.079
 as you can see this balcony is not quite 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.849
 typical place for pismeshek 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.239
 Sorry not something else but never went 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.239
 so you have to carry me 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.599
 a typical task for a stack and rather even 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.599
 tyazh 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.879
 hall as you can see hanging out 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.760
 enemy 7 but for now i 'm trying to keep 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.799
 a passage through which everyone who does not climb 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.859
 laziness 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:02.299
 well, 4 frags 1300 damage already thousands 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:06.569
 500 damage dear of course 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.909
 somewhat arrogant whether z then 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.769
 thieves 7 as you can see here by the way 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.859
 telling them all someone says they are 7 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.689
 bad form to have a drink and have four frags 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.840
 human 40 six percent blues and 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:22.739
 occasionally such offensive occur 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.400
 hits so it's quite a quite 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.659
 by the way, he had no gun 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.280
 stomping a rank not only from which I 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:34.829
 I went to the predopa damaga in 110,000 a little 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.669
 a smaller break through the way look our 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.500
 im7 guide 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.349
 the car is actually very nice and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.079
 of course you need to be able to drive with it 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.760
 here is just so new arash of course 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.220
 she cum quickly and because they quit 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.519
 very mustache 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.680
 than the seven level throws well 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.010
 actually t49 also throw and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.659
 the world and there certainly come in handy 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.349
 podalyber well and respectively here 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.389
 just as square 1 is not a sin to shoot 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.359
 subcaliber because it is enough 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.680
 strong but there is a lot of a lot of damage 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.889
 gobbled up gruz unfortunately kv-1 not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.639
 caught fire nokia account 1 st 8 already account in 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.959
 our favor 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.489
 on my often almost 2,000 damage and five 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.710
 frags 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.440
 left 13 shells shooting kit 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.050
 here of course small 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.900
 but you know it without me and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.780
 accordingly, you should try all the same 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.460
 so that all the shells fall although I 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.199
 there will still be plenty enough here 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.620
 promo folders for what I have long been on 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.720
 the car did not fall and do not know the speed or 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.879
 hits and projectile 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.919
 Well, the enemy is now their three cars 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.030
 Remains and 10 I try without light 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:56.680
 kill from this bad m2 what is not 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:01.090
 wants to kill and now we still have 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.009
 died but such a fight turned out already 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.030
 more than two million units if only damage 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.729
 I took my warriors 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.740
 accordingly, you can watch the outcome of the battle 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.830
 I think that took off well x 5 6 frags 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.009
 warrior harmed 11 opponents filled more 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.379
