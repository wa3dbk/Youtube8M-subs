last<00:01:46.900> year<00:01:47.049> there<00:01:47.320> were<00:01:47.409> times<00:01:47.710> where<00:01:48.040> you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
last year there were times where you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.430 
last year there were times where you
know<00:01:48.760> as<00:01:49.000> long<00:01:49.180> as<00:01:49.330> everybody<00:01:49.750> had<00:01:49.930> fun<00:01:50.200> that

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.219 
was good well I mean the fun comes with
you<00:01:53.619> know<00:01:53.740> competing<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:56.020> discovering

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you know competing and in in discovering

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.000 
you know competing and in in discovering
capabilities<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.500> have<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.830> you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
capabilities that you have that you

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.830 
capabilities that you have that you
didn't<00:02:00.220> have<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.490> day<00:02:00.670> before<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.360> not<00:02:01.540> just

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
didn't have the day before it's not just

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.050 
didn't have the day before it's not just
this<00:02:02.229> whole<00:02:02.439> field<00:02:02.799> good<00:02:02.979> session<00:02:03.460> stuff<00:02:03.790> that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
this whole field good session stuff that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.539 
this whole field good session stuff that
we<00:02:04.720> had<00:02:05.080> attend<00:02:05.439> see<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.710> gravitate<00:02:06.220> towards

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
we had attend see to gravitate towards

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.369 
we had attend see to gravitate towards
last<00:02:06.820> year<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.540> I<00:02:07.570> think<00:02:07.900> there's<00:02:08.110> improvement

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
last year so I think there's improvement

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.529 
last year so I think there's improvement
there<00:02:08.920> and

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
there and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.929 
there and
in<00:02:10.629> other<00:02:10.750> words<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.170> think<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:12.640> have<00:02:12.670> more

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
in other words I think we have more

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.789 
in other words I think we have more
competitive<00:02:13.569> people<00:02:13.750> developing<00:02:14.439> which<00:02:14.650> i

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
competitive people developing which i

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.440 
competitive people developing which i
think<00:02:14.859> is<00:02:15.129> very<00:02:15.219> important<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.120> think<00:02:16.150> is

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
think is very important and I think is

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
think is very important and I think is
going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.629> be<00:02:16.719> key<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.140> us<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.950> year<00:02:18.219> and<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
going to be key to us this year and the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.920 
going to be key to us this year and the
quicker<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:18.849> could<00:02:18.969> develop<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> more<00:02:19.810> we

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
quicker we could develop it the more we

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.819 
quicker we could develop it the more we
can<00:02:19.959> develop<00:02:20.349> at<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.739> better<00:02:21.480> offensively

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
can develop at the better offensively

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.559 
can develop at the better offensively
era<00:02:23.829> dolphins<00:02:24.219> got<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.489> getting<00:02:25.299> better<00:02:25.420> and

need<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.549> be<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:31.120> consistent<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:32.019> know<00:02:32.049> we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
need to be more consistent you know we

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.460 
need to be more consistent you know we
can<00:02:32.409> get<00:02:32.560> big<00:02:32.769> plays<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.549> can<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:34.470> several

can get big plays and we can get several
big<00:02:35.680> plays<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.239> ones<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.689> between<00:02:37.810> we

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
big plays it's the ones in between we

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.429 
big plays it's the ones in between we
need<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:39.540> make<00:02:40.540> sure<00:02:40.569> we<00:02:40.780> don't<00:02:40.959> squander

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
need to make sure we don't squander

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.099 
need to make sure we don't squander
plays<00:02:41.939> for<00:02:42.939> squandering<00:02:43.239> less<00:02:43.629> than<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:43.930> used

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
plays for squandering less than we used

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.929 
plays for squandering less than we used
to<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.530> still<00:02:44.829> squandering<00:02:45.400> more<00:02:45.609> than<00:02:45.790> we

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
to but still squandering more than we

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.819 
to but still squandering more than we
should<00:02:48.480> drop<00:02:49.480> balls<00:02:49.750> from<00:02:50.019> aqua<00:02:50.650> dolphin

thought<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:09.510> thought<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.569> thought<00:03:10.659> he<00:03:10.959> had<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
thought I thought I thought he had a

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.020 
thought I thought I thought he had a
pretty<00:03:11.290> good<00:03:11.379> one<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.739> one<00:03:11.919> period<00:03:12.280> had<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.549> spot

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
pretty good one on one period had a spot

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
pretty good one on one period had a spot
he's<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> Pascal<00:03:14.139> period<00:03:14.729> so<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:17.260> able<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.560> learn

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
he's a Pascal period so be able to learn

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.949 
he's a Pascal period so be able to learn
anything<00:03:17.739> more<00:03:18.159> when<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.909> go<00:03:19.060> live<00:03:19.299> as<00:03:19.750> long

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
anything more when you go live as long

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.899 
anything more when you go live as long
as<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.260> did<00:03:20.409> today<00:03:20.560> with<00:03:20.829> full<00:03:21.250> tackling<00:03:21.699> oh

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
as you did today with full tackling oh

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.449 
as you did today with full tackling oh
no<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> think<00:03:23.169> it's<00:03:23.500> important<00:03:23.979> to<00:03:24.010> work<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
no I think it's important to work the

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.670 
no I think it's important to work the
tackling<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.090> teach<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.569> tackling<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.290> mean<00:03:26.470> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
tackling to teach the tackling I mean I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.490 
tackling to teach the tackling I mean I
mean<00:03:27.609> because<00:03:27.790> then<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.269> reveals<00:03:28.569> bad<00:03:28.959> angles

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
mean because then it reveals bad angles

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.969 
mean because then it reveals bad angles
you<00:03:29.709> know<00:03:29.859> I<00:03:29.889> mean<00:03:31.260> somebody<00:03:32.260> runs<00:03:32.680> behind

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
you know I mean somebody runs behind

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.309 
you know I mean somebody runs behind
touches<00:03:33.459> off<00:03:33.669> and<00:03:34.000> says<00:03:34.239> yeah<00:03:34.449> I<00:03:34.479> got<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.139> well

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
touches off and says yeah I got and well

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.990 
touches off and says yeah I got and well
let's<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.829> if<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:36.010> really<00:03:36.280> got<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.669> you<00:03:36.819> know

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
let's see if you really got it you know

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.960 
let's see if you really got it you know
and<00:03:37.120> some<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.389> that<00:03:37.540> um<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:39.609> know<00:03:39.699> looks

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and some of that um you know looks

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
more you tackle the more it's going to

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.520

of<00:03:56.590> works

of works

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.750 
of works
we<00:03:58.459> try<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.700> get<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> good<00:03:59.510> balance<00:03:59.750> of<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.349> and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
we try to get a good balance of it and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.100 
we try to get a good balance of it and
but<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.790> think<00:04:02.150> doing<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.569> during<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.900> teen

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
but I think doing it during the teen

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.400 
but I think doing it during the teen
periods<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.920> last<00:04:04.330> two<00:04:05.330> practices<00:04:06.020> has<00:04:06.200> been

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
periods the last two practices has been

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.010 
periods the last two practices has been
good<00:04:06.680> work<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.310> think<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:07.730> been<00:04:08.720> good

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
good work and I think it's been good

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.320 
good work and I think it's been good
spacing<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.069> way<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.310> seems<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.700> work

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
spacing it that way it seems to work

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.170 
spacing it that way it seems to work
pretty<00:04:11.510> well<00:04:11.660> for<00:04:11.840> us<00:04:12.400> hey<00:04:13.400> coach<00:04:13.640> yeah<00:04:13.910> could
