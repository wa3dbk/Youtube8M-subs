00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome to a new ba ago 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 this may be irrelevant 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 Want to take the broadways he talks about 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.320
 was on the 5.11 patch a little bit 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 changed and we look at what there 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.309
 happened and what comes out because 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 Of course you tried him in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 to strengthen any way that means 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
 the question is no longer necessary or 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 less but yes how exactly are they 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.689
 pay what has really become active 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.220
 done because it has done with james 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 for his ultimate need and no 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.380
 leveling more 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 that means he has that ability of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.130
 beginning to look like cute to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
 For example , he does not have to score points 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 invest more purely because the old 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 James was making the decision 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.500
 namely had to hit level 6 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 really still has the ultimate for her 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.739
 of course had needed defensive 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 Of course he also has one at the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 Transformation received better bonuses 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 So as soon as the points went into it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 but it has become very ugly 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 Cited because such a relative 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.030
 cautious value of the new james 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 however, this bonuses gets now if 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 simply level 6 level from the 16th 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 not a bad thing in principle 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.890
 of course, but now have the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.720
 point distribution are terminated and the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 has done it because now we can not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.470
 more five points in one skill 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.450
 stuck but 64 and that is now also 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 the point where jason substantial ba 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.159
 has that means kilian to you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.799
 is already high on both instances 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.009
 gone and that in the hammer from around 30 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.680
 years or in the range form and 40 so 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 that's not less 40 now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 bare bones look more freely erb 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 Of course the problem is that you have something 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 go on level 6 points 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.470
 as synonymous takes but have this point 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.299
 she just referred mercilessly improved 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.920
 on the ability in the range 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.610
 rome , the ipod touch is completely the same 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.470
 remained 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 of course, based on his values 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.960
 that means one is still at 110 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.399
 percent 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.340
 also the cooldown is identical 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 but you have to remember 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 this value can only be achieved if you 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 has put in six points 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.909
 but we still have the ability to do that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.320
 Of course, the hammer form also has 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.170
 to experience a little brook that means 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.149
 at the highest level at level 6 update 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.880
 also 20 more damage is involved 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 now 400 what is really a lot of good 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 and the ability has more 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.180
 or less only in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.580
 the rain stream is changed and that is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 the current ones were a little bit more 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 to accelerate to sixth level 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.220
 mind you all clear 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.900
 the question is if you do the whole thing 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.180
 that's really true 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 just a straight abbas is there 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.390
 as any weaken or not 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 because clearly the damage was there left and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.000
 Right is the cinema right at home 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 this center has been damaged and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 to strengthen that also come 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.650
 you have to be a bit tricky 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.060
 Consider the following if the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.700
 point distribution in league of legends 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.290
 has a certain system for most 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.250
 take from you is just like 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.410
 man level 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.330
 that's just given that means 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.620
 usually we take on all three 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.720
 ability there are a few exceptions 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.340
 but often this is the case and catching 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.140
 we have a certain ability 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.680
 maximize with the reserved tend 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.420
 there 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.720
 that means on stubborn 5 we mostly have 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.519
 a distribution of 311 or 131 depending on 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.500
 the good and then for stage 6 we will 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.970
 the ultimate and then we continue to level 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.400
 The labeling itself has a system 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.319
 that means after the ultimate 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.549
 not easy the cinema up to level 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.650
 5 maximize 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.900
 the whole thing goes to level 9 and the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.180
 Unfortunately, I had to get out of my own mechanics 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.530
 blade is nowhere that leveling in 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.630
 league of legends works 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.370
 like this and do not get worried 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 equal to james a skill in league 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.780
 of legends may never be 2 levels higher 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.850
 be as the sum of the others 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.190
 skills and their level is simple 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.780
 For example, you start with your kuan 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.239
 Stage 2 can yes I can take that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.640
 every day there would be 2 levels more distance than that 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.340
 on the other hand , you can go to level five 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.280
 An ability at level 3 often over 1 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.579
 because 1 1 2 and 3 is only one more than 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.920
 20 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.450
 well the reason is so david james yes 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.609
 only three abilities from her 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.470
 For example, it could not maximize that 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.090
 Enjoy comfort at level eight 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.160
 ability to have level 5 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810
 the cinema, for example, is not that 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.790
 my hope was that the money but it 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.079
 does not happen that has now 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.660
 this is at level 8 422 or 413 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.760
 that goes on that is also level 9 has 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.819
 the new james secure on normally 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.170
 level 5 and is thus weaker it is 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.639
 Although only harm itself ten 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.380
 difference and the whole thing will be natural 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.970
 through the higher level of others 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.609
 ability to balance a bit 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.099
 but it is still only 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.800
 but it is as I said only for 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.500
 the one skill per se at level 9 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.330
 where he was able to level 5 was one 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.620
 less to total does that 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.750
 of course , and we have something today 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.610
 learned a great deal about leveling though 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.139
 it is present and it should be in the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.030
 set the principle it becomes natural 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.189
 indirectly balanced but it is 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.139
 nevertheless tricky target but it was by 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.740
 beginning with james a certain ride 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.409
 to go 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.169
 jason box champion so he can do this 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.210
 path is more straightforward and offensive 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.129
 the thing is now if james now 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.169
 despite this strength in the meter purely 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.150
 Fits or not because the problem 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.460
 is here at the is currently no 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.189
 right pop composition gives more than that 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.419
 clearly the lccs are far ahead of them 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.520
 have very many pop compositions 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.620
 with indiscriminately the middle with kockmann the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.539
 unpacked in the middle but of course very much 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.430
 special pc's if he has to say so 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.139
 that are still very present and 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.819
 The cinema of James can be easy 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.990
 be blocked intercepted 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.849
 Of course it has a blatant 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.650
 explosions radio, you have to 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.330
 But a real feeling has to be mentioned 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.479
 thus more coverage report so 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.150
 rather by a header from above like that 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.830
 super without earth fall in this post with 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.539
 the blood into the eco what an idea carey 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.550
 sometime later, too, but has 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.009
 Of course, even if he does something different 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.659
 and late just needs chase 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.279
 anyway that moora mana and he needs 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.960
 Nevertheless brutalized super super 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.969
 many great additions are at this 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.729
 Of course, his composition is a hammer 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.900
 by execution he should be in one 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.729
 say against one that it is not so 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
 I often look forward to see if he is 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.229
 back in the meter because then we 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.449
 Of course, more hdh again in the middle 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.330
 would pack and the top player after 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.960
 as before filled with playmate peaches 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.240
 can be 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.550
 at the lcs it's just the ramp and 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.169
 even in sudoku design or creeps 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.779
 another corner on the top player and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.740
 of course, also the magical 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.870
 damage for the whole composition 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.300
 I personally bring with me how 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.680
 said that has done well many have him 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.270
 also missing and i have many 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.099
 queries get a maximum of one why 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.599
 nobody plays james and i think through 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.189
 he is the improvement of his number 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.360
 his goal to get back to the meter 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.819
 moved closer 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.979
 good all found a very very 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.189
 relaxed skin in and have fun while 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.189
 run
