00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
made so my advice to you is to aim to
maintain<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.390> least<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
maintain or at least if you know in

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.770 
maintain or at least if you know in
terms<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.340> weight<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.000> return<00:01:57.299> about<00:01:57.479> weight

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
terms of weight in return about weight

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.740 
terms of weight in return about weight
then<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> five-pound<00:01:59.750> leniency

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
then have like a five-pound leniency

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
then have like a five-pound leniency
like<00:02:01.259> let<00:02:01.500> yourself<00:02:01.920> gained<00:02:02.159> five<00:02:02.430> pounds

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
like let yourself gained five pounds

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
like let yourself gained five pounds
like<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.240> alright<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> get

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
