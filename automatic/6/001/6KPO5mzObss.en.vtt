00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
guy who's sitting up there because the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.970 
guy who's sitting up there because the
original<00:00:58.079> Cobra<00:00:59.079> vehicles<00:00:59.470> didn't<00:00:59.860> have<00:00:59.950> a

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
original Cobra vehicles didn't have a

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.530 
original Cobra vehicles didn't have a
lot<00:01:00.160> of<00:01:00.190> protection<00:01:00.370> for<00:01:00.850> their<00:01:01.000> people<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.450> I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
lot of protection for their people and I

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.750 
lot of protection for their people and I
wanted<00:01:01.810> my<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.020> care<00:01:02.590> about<00:01:02.800> my<00:01:02.950> Cobra<00:01:03.430> soldiers

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
wanted my I care about my Cobra soldiers

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.530 
wanted my I care about my Cobra soldiers
a<00:01:03.790> little<00:01:04.089> bit<00:01:04.180> more<00:01:04.740> so<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.770> built<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
a little bit more so I built that this

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.660 
a little bit more so I built that this
this<00:01:08.110> one<00:01:08.320> here<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.829> this<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.280> more<00:01:09.520> recent

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
this one here is this is a more recent

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.690 
this one here is this is a more recent
this<00:01:09.909> is<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.180> Stinger<00:01:10.650> Jeep<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:12.520> is

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
this is the Stinger Jeep and that one is

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.240 
this is the Stinger Jeep and that one is
as<00:01:13.300> close<00:01:13.810> as<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:14.080> could<00:01:14.140> get<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> original

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
as close as I could get to the original

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.560 
as close as I could get to the original
so<00:01:15.430> there<00:01:15.580> I've<00:01:15.729> really<00:01:16.000> not<00:01:16.150> made<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> lot<00:01:16.540> of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
so there I've really not made a lot of

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.160 
so there I've really not made a lot of
changes<00:01:17.409> at<00:01:17.530> all<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:17.979> more<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.370> model<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
changes at all it's more of a model the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.289 
changes at all it's more of a model the
the<00:01:20.590> other<00:01:20.740> his<00:01:20.920> tank<00:01:21.159> I<00:01:21.250> had<00:01:21.430> over<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
the other his tank I had over in the

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.490 
the other his tank I had over in the
other<00:01:22.450> quarter<00:01:23.640> over<00:01:24.640> there<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
other quarter over there is just a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.140 
other quarter over there is just a
variant<00:01:26.920> more<00:01:27.070> than<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.340> PC<00:01:27.670> version<00:01:27.850> with<00:01:28.120> a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
variant more than a PC version with a

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.820 
variant more than a PC version with a

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
and over here this slightly bigger this

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.200

is<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.539> Fang<00:02:01.749> -<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.229> these<00:02:02.319> are<00:02:02.380> all<00:02:03.210> fairly

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
is the Fang - and these are all fairly

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.270 
is the Fang - and these are all fairly
iconic<00:02:04.869> Cobra<00:02:05.140> vehicles<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.710> I've<00:02:05.859> made

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
iconic Cobra vehicles that I've made

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.580 
iconic Cobra vehicles that I've made
some<00:02:06.549> slight<00:02:07.270> changes<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.869> but<00:02:08.229> I've<00:02:08.319> tried<00:02:08.500> to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
some slight changes to but I've tried to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.220 
some slight changes to but I've tried to
keep<00:02:08.769> fairly<00:02:09.099> close<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.549> originals<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
keep fairly close to the originals and

maggot if you go go back to the light

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.240 
maggot if you go go back to the light
gray<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.720> that's<00:02:29.500> another<00:02:29.799> one<00:02:30.010> where<00:02:30.220> I

there on that white table is the you see
there's<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.370> little<00:03:06.579> there's<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.030> great<00:03:07.329> turret

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
there's a little there's a great turret

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.920 
there's a little there's a great turret
there<00:03:07.959> sure<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:09.310> put<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.670> turret<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.299> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
there sure I can put that turret on the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.770 
there sure I can put that turret on the
maggot<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:12.099> replace<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.730> basic<00:03:13.329> artillery

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
maggot to replace the basic artillery

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.599 
maggot to replace the basic artillery
chart<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.169> an<00:03:14.290> anti-aircraft<00:03:14.769> turret<00:03:15.099> I'm

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
chart with an anti-aircraft turret I'm

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.470 
chart with an anti-aircraft turret I'm
going<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> switch<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.389> out

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
going to switch it in and out

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.150 
going to switch it in and out
interchangeable<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.500> bit<00:03:17.650> yeah<00:03:17.950> so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
interchangeable a little bit yeah so

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.620 
interchangeable a little bit yeah so
that's<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:18.549> my<00:03:18.730> flak<00:03:19.060> version<00:03:19.419> of<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
that's like my flak version of the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.860 
that's like my flak version of the
maggot<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.500> gives<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.889> a<00:03:20.950> nice<00:03:21.400> way<00:03:21.639> to

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
maggot so it gives it a nice way to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.089 
maggot so it gives it a nice way to
build<00:03:22.870> more<00:03:23.109> vehicles<00:03:23.500> without<00:03:23.739> having<00:03:24.010> to

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
build more vehicles without having to

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.890 
build more vehicles without having to
rebuild<00:03:24.370> most<00:03:24.669> of<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.880> vehicle<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.419> makes

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
rebuild most of the vehicle that makes

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.390 
rebuild most of the vehicle that makes
sense<00:03:26.139> so<00:03:26.620> you've<00:03:26.739> got<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:26.889> really<00:03:27.280> interesting

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
sense so you've got a really interesting

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400 
sense so you've got a really interesting
wide<00:03:27.970> range<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.419> vehicle<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.870> what<00:03:29.019> do<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.169> use

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
wide range of vehicle so what do you use

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.289 
wide range of vehicle so what do you use
this<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:29.829> do<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.069> find<00:03:30.400> photos<00:03:30.639> online<00:03:30.910> or

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
this like do you find photos online or

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.750 
this like do you find photos online or

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
year as far as this stuff goes is I

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.100 
year as far as this stuff goes is I
should<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.450> have<00:04:23.540> some<00:04:23.660> good<00:04:23.930> guy

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
should really have some good guy

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.740 
should really have some good guy
vehicles<00:04:24.500> too<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:24.860> then<00:04:25.010> also<00:04:25.160> out<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.750> you

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
vehicles too so then also out that you

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.970 
vehicles too so then also out that you
know<00:04:26.870> they're<00:04:27.110> getting<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.440> best<00:04:27.620> food<00:04:27.860> by

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
know they're getting the best food by

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.860 
know they're getting the best food by
some<00:04:28.250> some<00:04:28.820> other<00:04:28.940> faction<00:04:29.360> over<00:04:29.540> here<00:04:29.720> but

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
some some other faction over here but

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.270 
some some other faction over here but
they<00:04:29.960> they<00:04:30.140> should<00:04:30.200> have<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.470> tank<00:04:30.800> or<00:04:30.950> two<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.250> I

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
they they should have a tank or two to I

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
micro scale so I've had little tanks

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.930 
micro scale so I've had little tanks
much<00:05:20.240> smaller<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:20.980> roll<00:05:21.980> around<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.520> I<00:05:22.610> just

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
much smaller that roll around and I just

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.720 
much smaller that roll around and I just
take<00:05:23.120> out<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.540> minifig<00:05:23.990> scale<00:05:24.550> elements<00:05:25.550> like

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
take out the minifig scale elements like

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.210 
take out the minifig scale elements like
the<00:05:25.910> bunkers<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.420> houses<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.220> maybe

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
the bunkers in the houses and maybe

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.610 
the bunkers in the houses and maybe
replace<00:05:28.580> them<00:05:28.730> with<00:05:28.850> micro<00:05:29.180> scale<00:05:29.620> buildings

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
replace them with micro scale buildings

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.030 
replace them with micro scale buildings
and<00:05:30.800> houses<00:05:30.920> and<00:05:31.430> then<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.570> just<00:05:33.020> turns<00:05:33.860> it

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
and houses and then it just turns it

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.580 
and houses and then it just turns it
into<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.280> totally<00:05:34.580> different<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.810> know<00:05:35.960> so

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
into a totally different you know so

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.650 
into a totally different you know so
that<00:05:36.770> is<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.490> little<00:05:37.730> footbridge<00:05:38.150> there<00:05:38.450> if

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
that is that little footbridge there if

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.750 
that is that little footbridge there if
I<00:05:38.810> we<00:05:39.050> built<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:39.530> just<00:05:39.560> very<00:05:39.920> slightly<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.400> for

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
I we built it just very slightly and for

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.360 
I we built it just very slightly and for
microfolk<00:05:41.210> scale<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.870> could<00:05:42.110> be<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:43.220> could

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
microfolk scale that could be that could

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.330 
microfolk scale that could be that could
be<00:05:43.430> like<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.610> highway<00:05:44.060> bridge<00:05:44.680> yeah<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.040> that's

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
be like a highway bridge yeah so that's

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.950 
be like a highway bridge yeah so that's
I<00:05:46.490> see<00:05:46.670> what<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> modular<00:05:47.390> kind<00:05:47.570> of<00:05:47.660> thing<00:05:47.810> you

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
I see what the modular kind of thing you

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.240 
I see what the modular kind of thing you
can<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.320> can<00:05:48.470> interchange<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:48.950> with<00:05:49.160> all

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
can you can interchange that with all

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.200 
can you can interchange that with all
sorts

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
sorts

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.149 
sorts
that's<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.629> idea<00:05:50.930> it's<00:05:51.229> you<00:05:51.620> know<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.770> want<00:05:52.069> to
