00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.070
 Boysen is important in work 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.070
 I would certainly be important from abroad 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.639
 on the other hand haslach-herrenberg-kuppingen it was a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.420
 Giant effort Example of two equivalent teams 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.070
 in the end, unfortunately, only on weekdays cheered 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.269
 also remembered winning the league leaders in the sunshine 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 correspondingly big disappointment among the train drivers 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.369
 saw gameplay several times or not 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.610
 All of my at least one point earned as much as we have six or far 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.300
 away 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 Well what he has just not so waiter rhein-mountain but expensive 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.710
 Super fought 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.140
 but in Bergkamen no two points 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 traded the 60 minutes acts said the DSH 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.290
 Fichtner climbers demanded everything 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.840
 From the first minute an intense game developed 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.610
 after 17 minutes it was 6 2 6 both teams acted on equal terms 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.360
 but why haslach-herrenberg-kuppingen has the place in the sun 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.280
 showed up in the aftermath 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.460
 The best attack of the league played the Lok defense dizzy 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.619
 fast ballstaff and a strong backspace put Pirna out to the guest 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.840
 Baden-württemberg moved led away after 28 minutes with 14 to 9 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 Nevertheless, the first time we were normal in the time before 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.020
 many simple balls have thrown away 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 all opponents want to go to five goals 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.620
 but in abundance Donat Afterwork is supposed to do that 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.040
 Coach Fascher too many 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.920
 Little things made the difference during the evening while the guests hardly 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.159
 The ESVK faltered and turned blackouts 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.929
 again and again, the home side left clearest chances 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.110
 In addition, the c-team had to invest a lot of good opportunities 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.930
 plays frequently 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770
 Pröll be extended to cover that offensive or 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.390
 which is hard to play must have a lot of patience and not as 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 first is to crossover 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 Percent seek or animal welfare 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.490
 position 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.000
 there you have to percent 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.590
 Erwin Lotter have a lot of patience 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.110
 and then you also get the chance to get a chance also get the first one 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.830
 half 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.700
 Demuth I do not know five six times free in front of goal then Semprún failed 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.149
 a half time with 2 3 + gone 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.319
 for refining food 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.390
 at 15 to 12 led haslach-herrenberg-kuppingen 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.120
 half 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 for what Sarah Timo Bichler at this time the game already 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.729
 a calf injury went checkmate the right winger 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.289
 but Bernard was able to compensate for this failure with great passion 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.289
 against the home side also in halftime two works 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.350
 at that time the TSV played with high risk 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.199
 was rewarded for that too 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.349
 again and again fought back 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 but when the game threatened to tip 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.710
 Completely calloused, the Baden-Württemberg weaved their son down 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 in terms of Kaltschnuzzigkeit were the guests 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.629
 not to be outdone 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.039
 This procedure is what counts for these little things 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.759
 "You are ball safe, we are not standing there because the scene is going to be there 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:04.029
 that 60 minutes will be answered for Norbert no dead but anyway 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:09.199
 32 Bodelwitzer prevent Weibersbrunn from having to play the title 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.199
 We are told that they have the counter-attack 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.719
 the association demands big 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.919
 immediately again gates and related reasons have been words are 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.929
 this blackout Burdisso Ortloff percent in the phase where was 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.349
 Draw hoarding and tree on three goals convince direction 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.819
 the scene mentioned certainly the sticking point RH 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.299
 We ask compensation by Robert knows today a sleeper unit of the 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.769
 Overall market team 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.629
 despite personal superiority 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.269
 conceded the HSV a goal 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.719
 whoever is normally convinced must be awhile 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.229
 been in Marina di Carrara 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.249
 He does not care if he's angry or if he's playing over three 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.449
 but it just has to be fact 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.389
 haslach-herrenberg-kuppingen also took advantage of weaknesses 1 case Tauss at the end 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.229
 won the guest 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.890
 and earns 33 to 32 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.419
 played well and yet lost the situation at SV Lok is coming to a head 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.460
 four games left before the end of the season 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.760
 the farmers stand on a relegation spot Repro becomes natural 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.909
 now around 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.919
 very high but we still have to stay cool 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.539
 yes, wait for our chance 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.430
 Those suffering from cold ice use Tamron Nortrup and I'm sure we will 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.270
 have 60 minutes to become league leaders 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.559
 and I think if the last one was missing pictures about the car there 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.710
 but more state 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.660
 she wanted to know how it is in the rehearsals for political fuel 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.879
 Saab with confidence until the last matchday 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.770
 but we just have to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.629
 whether there are still two home games left for the DSV yet 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.650
 no information 21st April is in the catcher against Friedberg 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.070
 thanks is every support asked it is about the league in league three 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.070
 It's about the handball future of companies 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.349
 our guys understand their craft 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.460
 the home game of the TSV was still presented to them by Autohaus Jonas
