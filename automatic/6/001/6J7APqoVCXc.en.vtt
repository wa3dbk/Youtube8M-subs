looks like starting to get the color of
the<00:00:20.759> dark<00:00:20.970> chocolate<00:00:21.360> now<00:00:22.320> we're<00:00:23.310> almost<00:00:23.490> done

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the dark chocolate now we're almost done

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
the dark chocolate now we're almost done
and<00:00:24.060> I'll<00:00:24.240> tell<00:00:24.450> you<00:00:24.540> a<00:00:24.599> trick<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.050> McAndrew

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and I'll tell you a trick with McAndrew

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
and I'll tell you a trick with McAndrew
especially<00:00:26.550> if<00:00:26.669> you're<00:00:26.820> using<00:00:26.970> any<00:00:27.240> kind<00:00:27.300> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
especially if you're using any kind of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.890 
especially if you're using any kind of
cast<00:00:27.750> iron<00:00:28.020> cookware<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> heat

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
cast iron cookware is that the heat

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.179 
cast iron cookware is that the heat
continues<00:00:30.900> even<00:00:31.260> after<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.650> turn<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> heat

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
continues even after you turn the heat

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
continues even after you turn the heat
on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.519> stove<00:00:32.580> off<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.449> I'm<00:00:33.540> cutting<00:00:33.720> it<00:00:33.900> off

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
on the stove off so I'm cutting it off

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.570 
on the stove off so I'm cutting it off
but<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.769> actually<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> continue

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
but this is actually going to continue

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.520 
but this is actually going to continue
cooking<00:00:35.730> per<00:00:36.090> minute<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.900> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> stop

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
cooking per minute so you want to stop

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.979 
cooking per minute so you want to stop
just<00:00:37.800> short<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.879> where<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.269> want<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> root<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
just short of where you want the root to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.259 
just short of where you want the root to
end<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.129> reason<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> carryover

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
end up and the reason is the carryover

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.799 
end up and the reason is the carryover
heat<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> cast<00:00:43.350> iron<00:00:43.470> cookware<00:00:43.739> or

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
heat in the cast iron cookware or

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
heat in the cast iron cookware or
actually<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.019> a<00:00:46.409> lot<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> cookware<00:00:46.979> but<00:00:47.339> more

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
actually in a lot of cookware but more

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.810 
actually in a lot of cookware but more
so<00:00:48.150> in<00:00:48.210> cast<00:00:48.449> iron<00:00:48.620> will<00:00:49.620> continue<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> take

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so in cast iron will continue to take

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.789 
so in cast iron will continue to take
this<00:00:51.000> another<00:00:51.330> shade<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:51.780> darker<00:00:51.930> which

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
this another shade or two darker which

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.100 
this another shade or two darker which
is<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.220> where<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.400> want<00:00:53.729> it<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:53.850> end<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
is actually where I want it to end up so

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.130 
is actually where I want it to end up so
a<00:00:55.350> dark<00:00:55.619> chocolate<00:00:55.769> roof<00:00:56.190> equal<00:00:57.000> parts<00:00:57.299> oil

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
a dark chocolate roof equal parts oil

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
a dark chocolate roof equal parts oil
and<00:00:58.559> flour<00:00:59.040> and<00:00:59.400> you<00:00:59.580> simply<00:00:59.850> cook<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> stir

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and flour and you simply cook and stir

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
and flour and you simply cook and stir
slowly<00:01:01.369> until<00:01:02.369> it<00:01:02.549> gets<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.909> color<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.720> dark

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
slowly until it gets the color of dark

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.980 
slowly until it gets the color of dark
chocolate<00:01:04.129> now<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> base<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
chocolate now this will be the base of a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.980 
chocolate now this will be the base of a
really<00:01:07.590> yummy<00:01:07.890> gumbo<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.330> flavor<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
really yummy gumbo and the flavor is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.510 
really yummy gumbo and the flavor is
second<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> none<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.890> can't<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.310> any

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
second to none and you can't get it any

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
second to none and you can't get it any
other<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.229> takes<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
other way so it takes a little bit of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
other way so it takes a little bit of
time<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> effort<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
time and effort to make one but it is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.470 
time and effort to make one but it is
very<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.380> worth<00:01:16.620> it<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.790> you're<00:01:18.120> gonna<00:01:18.270> do

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
very very worth it so if you're gonna do

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.350 
very very worth it so if you're gonna do
it<00:01:18.570> yourself<00:01:18.660> just<00:01:19.500> remember<00:01:20.090> don't<00:01:21.090> walk

maybe try the TV on while you're taking

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.940 
maybe try the TV on while you're taking
care<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.160> is<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:36.780> simple<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
care of it it is very very simple and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.690 
care of it it is very very simple and
very<00:01:37.980> straightforward<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.980> is<00:01:40.980> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
very straightforward and that is the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.290 
very straightforward and that is the
base<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> gumbo<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.730> almost<00:01:45.030> got<00:01:45.150> myself

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
base of the gumbo one almost got myself

00:01:45.300 --> 00:02:01.000 
base of the gumbo one almost got myself
