that I put them through so I'm going to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
that I put them through so I'm going to
combine<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.350> hopefully<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:41.070> gives<00:00:41.790> them

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
combine them hopefully that gives them

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
combine them hopefully that gives them
some<00:00:42.360> strength<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.550> let's<00:00:44.719> start<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.320> combine

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
some strength so let's start to combine

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.520

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
start by combining at the root I'll

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
start by combining at the root I'll
