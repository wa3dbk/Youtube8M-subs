it's<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> problem<00:00:45.320> because<00:00:46.320> saturated

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's not a problem because saturated

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's not a problem because saturated

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.280 
contaminated with with bacteria and
stuff<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.889> was<00:04:01.310> eaten<00:04:01.609> raw<00:04:01.819> you<00:04:02.720> know<00:04:02.840> because

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
stuff and was eaten raw you know because

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.979 
stuff and was eaten raw you know because
if<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.799> at<00:04:03.950> nature<00:04:04.160> a<00:04:04.519> lion<00:04:05.299> eats<00:04:05.569> as<00:04:05.780> me

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
if you look at nature a lion eats as me

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.140 
if you look at nature a lion eats as me
straw<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.970> zebra<00:04:07.970> eats<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.840> ground

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
straw and zebra eats the ground

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.259 
straw and zebra eats the ground
strong<00:04:09.390> right<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> raw<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:12.090> is

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
strong right and so the raw I think is

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.640 
strong right and so the raw I think is
is<00:04:12.569> is<00:04:13.079> critical<00:04:13.829> yeah<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:16.500> don't

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
is is critical yeah and I think we don't

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.830 
is is critical yeah and I think we don't
want<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:17.009> stay<00:04:17.160> here<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.669> vegan<00:04:18.180> diets<00:04:18.660> or

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
want to stay here that vegan diets or

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.960 
want to stay here that vegan diets or
vegetarian<00:04:19.410> diets<00:04:19.799> are<00:04:19.979> more<00:04:20.220> healthy<00:04:20.940> than

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
vegetarian diets are more healthy than

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.200 
vegetarian diets are more healthy than
the<00:04:21.600> meat-eaters<00:04:22.139> diet<00:04:22.550> when<00:04:23.550> we<00:04:23.699> try<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.970> do

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
the meat-eaters diet when we try to do

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.810 
the meat-eaters diet when we try to do
is<00:04:24.360> or<00:04:24.509> what<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.720> try<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.050> find<00:04:25.350> out<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.680> just

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
is or what I try to find out it's just

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.230 
is or what I try to find out it's just
can<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:27.060> vegan<00:04:27.419> diet<00:04:27.630> be<00:04:27.960> as<00:04:28.139> healthy<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
can the vegan diet be as healthy as a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.689 
can the vegan diet be as healthy as a
meat-eater<00:04:30.240> side<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.919> not<00:04:32.190> about

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
meat-eater side and that it's not about

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.870 
meat-eater side and that it's not about
being<00:04:32.970> more<00:04:33.389> healthy<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.729> said

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
being more healthy and like you said

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.330 
being more healthy and like you said
it's<00:04:36.060> all<00:04:36.180> about<00:04:36.330> quality<00:04:36.780> not<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.560> bad<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:38.100> not

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
it's all about quality not so bad so not

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.770 
it's all about quality not so bad so not
so<00:04:38.490> much<00:04:38.639> about<00:04:38.759> animal<00:04:39.240> products<00:04:39.630> they

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
so much about animal products they

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.960 
so much about animal products they
arguing<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.650> argument<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.310> made<00:04:41.520> it's

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
arguing and the argument is made it's

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.230 
arguing and the argument is made it's
made<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.139> vegan<00:04:43.500> diet<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:44.850> won't<00:04:45.090> get

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
made that in a vegan diet you won't get

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.570 
made that in a vegan diet you won't get
enough<00:04:45.510> vitamin<00:04:45.750> b12<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:46.710> enough<00:04:47.070> lysine

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
enough vitamin b12 or enough lysine

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.240 
enough vitamin b12 or enough lysine
which<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:47.940> an<00:04:48.060> amino<00:04:48.240> acid<00:04:48.770> but<00:04:49.770> all<00:04:49.949> of<00:04:49.979> those

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
which is an amino acid but all of those

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.810 
which is an amino acid but all of those
you<00:04:50.520> can<00:04:50.760> do<00:04:50.940> by<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> supplement<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:53.250> they<00:04:53.460> so

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
you can do by a supplement so they so

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.629 
you can do by a supplement so they so
you<00:04:53.880> can<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:54.810> deal<00:04:55.020> with<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.310> no<00:04:56.310> again

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
you can you can deal with that no again

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.810 
you can you can deal with that no again
I<00:04:56.699> think<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.090> issue<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.870> issue<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.350> i<00:04:58.710> mean

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
I think the issue the issue is i mean

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.670 
I think the issue the issue is i mean
vegetarian<00:04:59.820> or<00:05:00.030> vegan<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.780> choice<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.440> lot<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
vegetarian or vegan is a choice a lot of

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.560 
vegetarian or vegan is a choice a lot of
people<00:05:01.800> don't<00:05:02.400> like<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.849> idea<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.300> killing

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
people don't like the idea of killing

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.779 
people don't like the idea of killing
animals<00:05:04.139> and<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.430> understand<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.380> but<00:05:07.789> but

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
animals and I I understand that but but

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.089 
animals and I I understand that but but
that's<00:05:09.000> not<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.240> health<00:05:09.449> argument<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:11.070> know

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
that's not a health argument you know

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.740 
that's not a health argument you know
the<00:05:11.340> health<00:05:11.520> argument<00:05:12.060> always<00:05:12.330> says<00:05:12.509> whatever

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
the health argument always says whatever

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.070 
the health argument always says whatever
you<00:05:13.110> eat<00:05:13.139> eat<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.370> clean<00:05:14.699> eat<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.240> fresh<00:05:15.510> eat<00:05:15.840> it

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
you eat eat it clean eat it fresh eat it

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.890 
you eat eat it clean eat it fresh eat it
all<00:05:16.289> eat<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.770> raw<00:05:16.979> eat<00:05:17.220> organic<00:05:17.760> that's<00:05:18.660> the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
all eat it raw eat organic that's the

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.900 
all eat it raw eat organic that's the
that's<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.440> health<00:05:19.740> argument<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:22.849> is<00:05:23.849> a

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
that's the health argument and and is a

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.719 
that's the health argument and and is a
vegan<00:05:24.570> diet<00:05:24.720> healthier<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.710> would<00:05:26.039> say<00:05:26.310> it's<00:05:26.550> a

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
vegan diet healthier I would say it's a

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.149 
vegan diet healthier I would say it's a
little<00:05:27.000> more<00:05:27.150> difficult<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.800> that

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
little more difficult I think that

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.460 
little more difficult I think that
eating<00:05:29.970> some<00:05:30.240> animal<00:05:30.659> product<00:05:31.080> gives<00:05:31.289> you

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
eating some animal product gives you

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.850 
eating some animal product gives you
cuts<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:31.979> little<00:05:32.190> bit<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.400> slack<00:05:33.530> but<00:05:34.530> you

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
cuts you a little bit of slack but you

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.860 
cuts you a little bit of slack but you
can<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.190> very<00:05:35.430> sick<00:05:35.699> on<00:05:35.849> animal<00:05:36.360> foods<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.810> you

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
can be very sick on animal foods and you

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.129 
can be very sick on animal foods and you
can<00:05:37.050> be<00:05:37.169> very<00:05:37.440> sick<00:05:37.740> on<00:05:37.919> on<00:05:38.370> on<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.780> vegan

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
can be very sick on on on just the vegan

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.740 
can be very sick on on on just the vegan
diet<00:05:40.349> the<00:05:41.010> issue<00:05:41.220> is<00:05:41.490> also<00:05:41.849> about<00:05:41.970> balance<00:05:42.599> and

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
diet the issue is also about balance and

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
diet the issue is also about balance and
the<00:05:42.870> issue<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:44.099> about<00:05:44.250> doing<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.060> right<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:46.440> if

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770

you're going to be vegan you have to

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.290 
you're going to be vegan you have to
invest<00:05:48.389> some<00:05:48.630> time<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:49.770> get<00:05:49.919> it<00:05:50.070> right<00:05:50.099> but<00:05:51.060> the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
but the time you invest should be about

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.980 
but the time you invest should be about
what<00:05:55.800> does<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:56.070> take<00:05:56.220> to<00:05:56.250> be<00:05:56.490> healthy<00:05:56.880> not<00:05:57.750> what
