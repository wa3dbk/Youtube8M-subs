00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.250
 greetings on this occasion let's talk 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.950
 of the planet uranus which is the seventh 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.100
 planet in distance from the sun 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.230
 and the third largest was the first 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.730
 planet to be discovered thanks to the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.470
 use of the telescope in the year 1781 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.949
 Uranus is named after the Roman god 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.420
 from heaven father of saturn and grandfather of 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:31.810
 jupiter and was discovered by sir 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.780
 william herschel as I told you in the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.550
 year of 1781 thanks to the use of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.010
 telescope because although now it is not 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.940
 it reaches to see very 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.620
 slightly to the naked eye it was until 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 the telescope that was used was used 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.809
 discover that it was a planet that had 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.990
 movement although very slow as data 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.770
 generals of one we do not have what 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.720
 the year of uranus or the time of the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.850
 period of translation around the sun 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:10.430
 is approximately 80 and 4.01 years 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.370
 Earth years 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.000
 and its axis of rotation rather its day or 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:25.770
 the rotation movement 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 It lasts approximately 17.23 hours 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.590
 the day of uranium 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.900
 minus is minus 17.23 because it goes on 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.940
 retrograde that is to say goes in 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.360
 contrary to how others are turning 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.360
 planets 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.640
 curiously now he does not have a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 a very curious way of rotating your 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.280
 axis of rotation if we draw and 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.409
 we see here a normal planet this is its 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.750
 axis of rotation then it will be like 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.729
 spinning like a spin instead urano 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.810
 its axis of rotation is let's say that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:12.260
 lying down with respect to the sun and has a 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.260
 inclination of 0.77 degrees what 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.019
 causes the stations in this 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.030
 planet are very peculiar if we 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.150
 we imagine the sunlight that goes 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.459
 coming to the planet because we are going to have 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.190
 that is going to be one of your hemispheres 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.620
 constantly lit by the sun 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.319
 for approximately 42 years and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.140
 at the same time the other hemisphere of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.920
 planet is going to be in the shadow is going to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.710
 be darkened also during 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.080
 approximately 42 years 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.140
 making their stations very 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.850
 curious, the strangest thing is that the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.940
 temperature here in the equator is higher 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.670
 It is warmer in the equator than in its 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 poles which is very curious because then 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.630
 in the equator does not directly give you the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.770
 Sun 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.090
 Why? 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.530
 has this inclination and because its 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.440
 temperature is higher than in the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.830
 ecuador really still do not know by 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.930
 what is in this configuration in this 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.930
 planet we do not know yet why 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:33.010
 good another general fact is that the mass 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.129
 of uranium is 14 points 5 times the mass of 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.129
 the earth 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.830
 and also 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.830
 have 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.680
 a core or its structure is believed 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.620
 internal you have a rocky core 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.000
 surrounded by a blanket of ice 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.569
 which in turn is surrounded by a 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.450
 gaseous atmosphere this gaseous atmosphere 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.060
 is composed of hydrogen helium and 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.510
 methane and here we are also seeing the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.379
 ring system that has urane and that 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.419
 was discovered after they left 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.660
 discovered the rings system 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:24.340
 Saturn is the second system of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.980
 rings to be discovered 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.639
 It was also discovered by William 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.639
 herschel 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.010
 and you also know that the material of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.650
 those that are made the particles that 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.150
 form this system of rings are 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.150
 dark materials 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.689
 are they have a size that goes from the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.650
 micrometers 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:57.040
 from micrometers 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.670
 up fractions of meters 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.050
 up fractions 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.050
 meters 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.930
 meters 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.990
 and now let's see the satellites that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.750
 has uranium 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.840
 now it does not have 27 known satellites 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.120
 and these satellites are named as 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.670
 characters from william's works 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.520
 shakespeare as curious facts we can 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.430
 see here the names of some of the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.350
 main satellites and it has only been 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.770
 had or has been carried out a mission of 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:40.750
 exploration now not that it was done 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:46.360
 for the mission voyager 2 of the nasa 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:48.520
 in the year of 1986 was when I arrive at 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.560
 Uranus system and it has been the only 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.890
 exploration that has been made of this 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.890
 planet
