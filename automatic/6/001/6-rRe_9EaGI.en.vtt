00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.280
 hello everyone to achieve this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.920
 dialogue you will need a 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.360
 white t-shirt from a falling fabric and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 a sewing machine or your ten 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.550
 fingers 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 I start by taking a piece of fabric 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 and I just cut out the shape of a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.990
 pocket I then come upside down 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 create a star she about 5 mm 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.630
 I agree and I pass by pass 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.310
 on it for him to hold the same thing 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 the other side and on the bottom to create 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.770
 a point for the water from the pocket of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 fold over about a single centimeter 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.699
 and I pass to them and here I go 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.390
 now sew the top of the pocket in 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.390
 following the dots 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 I take my t-shirt and I 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.530
 place my pocket disappointed I have more than 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.880
 sew according to the dots 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.360
 and that's how to create a pocket on a 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.940
 tee shirt I go to the mans I measure 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 passing my master all around is 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.260
 this measure I add a centimeter to 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.150
 the games then measure how many 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.380
 wide I decided to do my band in 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240
 taking into account the inside of my sleeve 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 and also adding a centimeter 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.390
 more for the relay after having 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.120
 cut my first tape game fold the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.490
 fabric in the length for the relay I 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.070
 pass my father and I remain to repair 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.990
 on the length once done I fill 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.960
 my fabric in 2 always in length 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.700
 a stroke of effort to maintain it 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.610
 I place my band around my sleeve and 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.350
 I make it hold with a needle and this 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.970
 on my entire sleeve then I 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.530
 sew to get this I repeat the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.490
 same operations as before for 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.340
 the second run 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.660
 and here is a white shirt with a new look 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.700
 see that this dialogue will have pleased you 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.840
 all made big kisses and I tell you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.840
 to the next ciao
