00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.660
Hey

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980
Oh God, you stink! Big party yesterday night?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.340
So good. You should have come.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.860
We were in a nightclub. Was so cool!

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.600
- Huge mistake! 
- I don't give a fuck, my dad is a lawyer.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.640
- Free entrance.
- With some bracelets and stuffs.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.820
- waaw careful, it  hurts.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.280
God yeah, I'm bleeding.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.220
Shut up.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.020
It's the first time we leave our stuffs at the coat check

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.800
Turnaround.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.220
And then, here we go.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.060
We came in, and it was overcrowded, I swear.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.900
And the DJ, sturdy, announced the tone of the party.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.540
Tonight, you stay calm, or I knock you down.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.040
*Drum beat*

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.900
Strong beat, you know.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.600
*bawdy song of CÃ©line F*ucking Dion*

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
*bawdy song*

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.500
However, he played the same song three times.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.260
*same bawdy song*

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.260
*same bawdy song*

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.520
*same bawdy song*

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.960
I've heard that he'll go to Ibiza this Summer.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.500
Wait, I know this club.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.780
Is it the one with 3 rooms - 3 ambiences?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.940
NO.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140
In fact, there is a single room,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.140
but many, many ambiences.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.860
SHUT UP!

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.060
SHUT UP!

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.320
I did nothing...

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.640
SHUT UP!

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.020
SHUT UP!

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.380
It was "open-bar", isn't it?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.420
I'm so frustrated.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.740
And what about the girls?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.680
At one point, a whole bus came in, buddy.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.360
Hey girls.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.700
Don't tell me you caught some pussy ?!

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.840
I didn't, but he did.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080
Right in his net.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.000
Good job! And you?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.940
Nah, just got a number.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.960
What's the club's name?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.260
The "Golden Shower"

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.500
He's peeing on me.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.580
It's a nice club. Even the DJ paid his round.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660
At this point, it became electric.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.980
I did nothing, I swear.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.580
Did you had an after?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.820
Of course. 
-Where?

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.860
At the "Golden Shower"

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.620
He's peeing again.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.320
They even had to bring us out at the end,  do you realize?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.080
Hey calm down! Huge mistake you remember?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.480
We said it wasn't us.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480
Get out now!

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.020
*Punch sound*

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840
Really, really awesome dudes in this club.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.440
You teased me so hard, let's go back together next week?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.000
No, we should not... 
- We should not over
- We can have to much, you know...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You know, we are not...

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
- Sturdy 
- anymore.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.980
*bawdy song*

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.840
*bawdy song*
