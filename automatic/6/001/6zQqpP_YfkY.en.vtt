 and device it costs you around 80 euros 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.120
 goes that costs according to has already counted 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.280
 a 2.8 inch screen 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.839
 where do you see that today with 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.600
 qvga resolution

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.659
 caskets which also here will uprising 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.460
 lie my device does have one 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.560
 dual core processor 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.970
 nevertheless does not feel very fast 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.440
 to 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.390
 yes the device just runs on android 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.980
 Android Jellybean the four point two round 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.420
 to be precise with is a dual core 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.580
 processor and gert 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.040
 he is a mediatek processor it 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.290
 device for still a bit slow and 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.930
 syrupy on the screen is super small 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.210
 low resolution so what will be the format 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.640
 is not such a big problem 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.860
 but it does not look really nice and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 throw on devices or the idle devices 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.340
 of cars that they also introduce here 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.800
 when that is a lot better it does cost 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 twice as much as 80 euros is of course 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.990
 very very little for a smartphone that 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 I really have a complete one 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.650
 Android smartphone animals so still with 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 this band there 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.040
 bit or for workouts can use to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.780
 to fitness 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.180
 listen my music time fitness and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.070
 runkeeper is pre-installed as 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.500
 here on the home screen to one side 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.820
 strike you get to see runkeeper and if 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740
 you use to the other side you get 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 A music player can play your music quickly 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.150
 operate 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.710
 so in that respect it is yes in itself 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.480
 nice set fitness 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.010
 but it is a very simple device 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.630
 is only if you really have very little money 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.149
 and a smartphone is the purchase 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.100
 this maybe recommended but on it 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.450
 at first glance it seems like you are anyway 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 better just a little bit more 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.010
 pull out for just a little more expensive 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.010
 phone
