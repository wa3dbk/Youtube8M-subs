00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
that the nexus 6 MX is nine had

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.250 
that the nexus 6 MX is nine had
underperformed<00:04:42.940> as<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.540> news<00:04:43.690> were<00:04:43.990> that

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.040 
underperformed as the news were that
Google's<00:04:44.920> q1<00:04:45.310> results<00:04:45.690> reflected<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.870> they

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
Google's q1 results reflected that they

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.150 
Google's q1 results reflected that they

which joe bob says verizon because it's

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.320

damn big and yes not everybody wants a

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.120 
damn big and yes not everybody wants a
phablet<00:04:58.720> good<00:04:58.930> point<00:04:59.170> and<00:04:59.470> then<00:04:59.590> jay<00:04:59.830> says

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
phablet good point and then jay says

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.770 
phablet good point and then jay says
school<00:05:00.550> could<00:05:00.850> have<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.180> some<00:05:01.360> effort<00:05:01.510> into

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
school could have put some effort into

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.170 
school could have put some effort into
making<00:05:02.020> this<00:05:02.290> setting<00:05:02.800> screen<00:05:03.430> useful

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
making this setting screen useful

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.710 
making this setting screen useful
somehow<00:05:04.420> but<00:05:04.810> no<00:05:05.340> not<00:05:06.340> even<00:05:06.670> enhanced<00:05:07.420> for

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
somehow but no not even enhanced for

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.260 
somehow but no not even enhanced for
built-in<00:05:08.080> apps<00:05:08.260> like<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:09.100> 6<00:05:09.310> plus<00:05:09.580> or<00:05:10.060> let

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
built-in apps like the 6 plus or let

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.940 
built-in apps like the 6 plus or let
alone<00:05:10.480> dual<00:05:10.780> pane<00:05:11.020> multitasking<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:11.830> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
alone dual pane multitasking like the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.350 
alone dual pane multitasking like the
mid<00:05:12.070> series<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.580> that's<00:05:12.700> my<00:05:12.880> point<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.270> you're

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
mid series and that's my point if you're

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.480 
mid series and that's my point if you're
gonna<00:05:13.450> have<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.720> phablet<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.380> carry<00:05:14.860> Galaxy<00:05:15.340> Note

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
gonna have a phablet I carry Galaxy Note

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.340 
gonna have a phablet I carry Galaxy Note
edge<00:05:15.640> for<00:05:15.880> example<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.690> reason<00:05:16.990> why<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.140> have

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
edge for example the reason why I have

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.020 
edge for example the reason why I have
it<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.560> because<00:05:17.590> there<00:05:18.010> is<00:05:18.100> some<00:05:18.280> added<00:05:18.610> value

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
it is because there is some added value

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.390 
it is because there is some added value
to<00:05:19.060> having<00:05:19.390> such<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.870> large<00:05:20.020> display<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.980> that

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
to having such a large display and that

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.370 
to having such a large display and that
is<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.670> real<00:05:21.910> problem<00:05:22.390> while<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.780> don't<00:05:23.110> like

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
is the real problem while I don't like

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.470 
is the real problem while I don't like
the<00:05:23.590> Nexus<00:05:23.920> 6<00:05:24.160> particularly<00:05:24.820> it's<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.330> big

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
the Nexus 6 particularly it's a big

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.450 
the Nexus 6 particularly it's a big
display<00:05:25.810> but<00:05:26.140> it's<00:05:26.260> just<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:26.950> big<00:05:27.130> display

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
display but it's just the big display

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.090 
display but it's just the big display
and<00:05:27.670> then<00:05:27.760> tech<00:05:28.000> 1<00:05:28.210> TV<00:05:28.420> says<00:05:28.960> if<00:05:29.260> Nexus<00:05:29.620> 6<00:05:29.860> was

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
and then tech 1 TV says if Nexus 6 was

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.970 
and then tech 1 TV says if Nexus 6 was
for<00:05:30.310> 499<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.690> Google<00:05:32.050> would<00:05:32.170> be<00:05:32.320> richer<00:05:32.770> and

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
for 499 the Google would be richer and

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.250 
for 499 the Google would be richer and
yes<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:34.000> think<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.330> was<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.630> biggest<00:05:34.870> problem

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
yes I think that was the biggest problem

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.350 
yes I think that was the biggest problem
the<00:05:35.320> Nexus<00:05:35.680> 6<00:05:36.070> is<00:05:36.250> just<00:05:36.520> too<00:05:36.760> expensive<00:05:37.000> for

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
the Nexus 6 is just too expensive for

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.210 
the Nexus 6 is just too expensive for
what<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.630> is<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.260> there<00:05:38.440> are<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:38.800> many<00:05:38.860> great

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
what it is and there are so many great

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.770 
what it is and there are so many great
options<00:05:39.490> out<00:05:39.880> there<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.240> give<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.480> more

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
options out there that give you more

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.050 
options out there that give you more
things<00:05:41.410> more<00:05:41.890> you<00:05:42.400> know<00:05:42.520> options<00:05:42.760> like

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
things more you know options like

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.460 
things more you know options like
expandable<00:05:43.600> storage<00:05:43.720> and<00:05:44.080> stuff<00:05:44.260> like<00:05:44.410> that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
expandable storage and stuff like that

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.920 
expandable storage and stuff like that
for<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.040> better<00:05:45.580> price<00:05:45.820> tag<00:05:46.150> or<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.480> same<00:05:46.690> price

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
for a better price tag or the same price

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.140 
for a better price tag or the same price
tag<00:05:47.230> so<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:47.770> think<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.010> Google<00:05:48.250> wasn't<00:05:48.910> really

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
tag so I think that Google wasn't really

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.670 
tag so I think that Google wasn't really
being<00:05:49.300> aggressive<00:05:49.810> it's<00:05:49.930> like<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.230> original

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
being aggressive it's like the original

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.740 
being aggressive it's like the original
days<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.100> Nexus<00:05:51.400> which<00:05:51.550> is<00:05:51.700> sad<00:05:51.910> that's<00:05:52.600> it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
days of the Nexus which is sad that's it

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.150
