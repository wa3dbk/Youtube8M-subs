00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
anyhow let's take a look at the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.750 
anyhow let's take a look at the
situation<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> at<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.460> end<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
situation this is at the end of the

situation this is at the end of the
first<00:01:02.940> turn<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.070> probably<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.519> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> flow

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
first turn I probably will kind of flow

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.100 
first turn I probably will kind of flow
in<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.400> out<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:12.720> looks<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
in and out as we go but it looks like

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.030 
in and out as we go but it looks like

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.640 
about this and probably the system as a
whole<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:55.230> event-driven<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:56.720> mechanism

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.110 

I'm<00:03:01.650> worried<00:03:02.280> about<00:03:02.430> replay<00:03:02.820> value<00:03:02.970> um

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
I'm worried about replay value um

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.090 
I'm worried about replay value um
obviously<00:03:06.120> for<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.350> people<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
obviously for a lot of people this is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.289 
obviously for a lot of people this is
not<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> big<00:03:08.580> deal<00:03:08.870> they'll<00:03:09.870> enjoy<00:03:10.440> being<00:03:10.980> able

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
not a big deal they'll enjoy being able

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.880 
not a big deal they'll enjoy being able
to<00:03:12.299> see<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.630> events<00:03:12.989> happen<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.500> slightly

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
to see the events happen in slightly

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.060 
to see the events happen in slightly
different<00:03:14.100> order<00:03:14.640> etc<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:16.320> I'm<00:03:16.830> always

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
different order etc but I'm always

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.009 
different order etc but I'm always
afraid<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.850> fixed<00:03:18.180> events<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.959> that

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
afraid with fixed events like this that

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.960 
afraid with fixed events like this that
are<00:03:19.230> very<00:03:19.470> very<00:03:19.739> specific<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.549> some<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.880> these

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
are very very specific and some of these

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.479 
are very very specific and some of these
are<00:03:21.239> there<00:03:22.019> specific<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> certain<00:03:22.799> countries

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
are there specific to certain countries

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.530 
are there specific to certain countries
etc<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:25.019> they<00:03:25.830> don't<00:03:26.010> capture<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:27.239> flavor

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
etc that they don't capture the flavor

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.960 
etc that they don't capture the flavor
and<00:03:27.690> quite<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.080> way<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.560> want<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.760> for

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and quite the way that I want to so for

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.259 
and quite the way that I want to so for
example<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.840> Nasr<00:03:31.320> card<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.860> has<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.670> Egypt

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
example the Nasr card it has to be Egypt

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.930 
example the Nasr card it has to be Egypt
all<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.190> something<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:36.000> and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
all you get something like that and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.500 
all you get something like that and
people<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.209> played<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.660> game<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> bit<00:03:40.200> no<00:03:40.980> ah

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
people have played the game a bit no ah

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.070 
people have played the game a bit no ah
Egypt<00:03:42.510> might<00:03:43.070> go<00:03:44.070> pro-soviet<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.239> I'm<00:03:45.840> going

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
Egypt might go pro-soviet so I'm going

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720 
Egypt might go pro-soviet so I'm going
to<00:03:46.110> play<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.350> little<00:03:46.560> differently<00:03:47.070> based<00:03:47.400> on

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
to play a little differently based on

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.400 
to play a little differently based on
that<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:50.100> ends<00:03:50.340> up<00:03:50.400> actually<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.959> can<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.380> a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
that that ends up actually that can be a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.960 
that that ends up actually that can be a
good<00:03:52.470> mechanism<00:03:52.859> uh<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.600> knowledge

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
good mechanism uh if that knowledge

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.080 
good mechanism uh if that knowledge
is<00:03:56.060> something<00:03:57.020> that's<00:03:57.140> built<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:58.760> trying

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
is something that's built in to trying

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.880 
is something that's built in to trying
to<00:03:59.240> recreate<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.870> historical<00:04:00.440> decisions

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
to recreate the historical decisions

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.460 
to recreate the historical decisions
that<00:04:01.070> were<00:04:01.190> made<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.690> case<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.140> seems<00:04:03.380> to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
that were made in this case it seems to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.650 
that were made in this case it seems to
be<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.710> opposite<00:04:04.360> there<00:04:05.360> was<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> lot<00:04:05.600> of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
be the opposite there was a lot of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.510 
be the opposite there was a lot of
British<00:04:05.960> influence<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.590> Egypt<00:04:06.890> at<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.190> point

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
British influence in Egypt at that point

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.580 
British influence in Egypt at that point
and<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.510> all<00:04:08.600> went<00:04:08.810> away<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:11.320> kind<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.410> feel

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and it all went away so I kind of feel

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.770 
and it all went away so I kind of feel
like<00:04:12.650> whatever<00:04:13.490> mechanism<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.330> being<00:04:14.570> used

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
like whatever mechanism is being used

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.020 
like whatever mechanism is being used
for<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.110> event<00:04:15.350> cards<00:04:15.740> wasn't<00:04:16.730> thought<00:04:16.970> out

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
for the event cards wasn't thought out

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.290 
for the event cards wasn't thought out
to<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.570> degree<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.109> had<00:04:18.320> hoped<00:04:19.420> i'm<00:04:20.440> also

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
to the degree that I had hoped i'm also

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.060 
to the degree that I had hoped i'm also
not<00:04:23.300> terribly<00:04:23.870> impressed<00:04:24.410> with<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
not terribly impressed with the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.200 
not terribly impressed with the
operations<00:04:25.910> point<00:04:26.240> draws<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.900> mean<00:04:27.410> that's<00:04:27.620> a

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
operations point draws I mean that's a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.330 
operations point draws I mean that's a
you<00:04:29.210> know<00:04:29.330> nice<00:04:29.600> little<00:04:29.960> feature<00:04:30.220> being<00:04:31.220> able

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
you know nice little feature being able

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.050 
you know nice little feature being able
to<00:04:31.490> hold<00:04:31.700> cards<00:04:32.540> etc<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.380> doesn't<00:04:33.680> really

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
to hold cards etc but it doesn't really

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.390 
to hold cards etc but it doesn't really
seem<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.640> mechanism<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.540> know<00:04:38.630> and

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
seem to it's a mechanism you know and

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000 
seem to it's a mechanism you know and
it's<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:40.820> slightly<00:04:41.390> hurts<00:04:42.010> solitaire

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it's one that slightly hurts solitaire

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.750 
it's one that slightly hurts solitaire
playability<00:04:43.630> although<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.490> for<00:04:46.490> what<00:04:46.610> I've

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
playability although and for what I've

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.570 
playability although and for what I've
heard<00:04:47.000> from<00:04:47.060> people<00:04:47.330> they<00:04:48.280> feel<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.460> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
heard from people they feel like the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.550 
heard from people they feel like the
game<00:04:49.730> can't<00:04:50.030> be<00:04:50.150> played<00:04:50.360> solitaire<00:04:50.930> or<00:04:50.960> these

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
game can't be played solitaire or these

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.060 
game can't be played solitaire or these
CD<00:04:52.190> geez<00:04:52.370> can't<00:04:52.640> be<00:04:52.820> played<00:04:53.060> solitaire<00:04:53.630> I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
CD geez can't be played solitaire I

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.560 
CD geez can't be played solitaire I
don't<00:04:55.070> see<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.310> at<00:04:55.550> all<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.990> me<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.560> looks

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
don't see that at all to me it looks

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.159 
don't see that at all to me it looks
fairly<00:04:59.570> reasonable<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.500> solitaire<00:05:01.160> game

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
fairly reasonable as a solitaire game

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.250 
fairly reasonable as a solitaire game
yeah<00:05:03.190> you<00:05:04.190> have<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.550> wear<00:05:04.880> two<00:05:05.120> hats<00:05:05.260> but

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
yeah you have to wear two hats but

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260 
yeah you have to wear two hats but
there's<00:05:06.919> not<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.130> lot<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.310> reaction<00:05:07.850> going<00:05:08.000> on

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
there's not a lot of reaction going on

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.420 
there's not a lot of reaction going on
and<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.720> find<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.169> be<00:05:09.380> more<00:05:09.620> painful<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.310> a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
and I find that to be more painful in a

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.120 
and I find that to be more painful in a
solitaire<00:05:10.910> game<00:05:11.120> then<00:05:13.660> then<00:05:14.660> really<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.380> fact

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
solitaire game then then really the fact

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.010 
solitaire game then then really the fact
that<00:05:16.280> somebody<00:05:16.669> new<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.390> something<00:05:17.870> that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
that somebody new is something that

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.250 
that somebody new is something that
somebody<00:05:18.410> else<00:05:18.650> did<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.880> Soviets<00:05:20.750> had<00:05:21.140> to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
somebody else did the Soviets had to
