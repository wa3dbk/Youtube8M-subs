00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
stationary sets but I think this is just

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.519 
stationary sets but I think this is just
a<00:00:16.619> file<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> pen<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.480> also<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
a file and pen and also have the
bookmark<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.199> quite<00:00:22.199> expensive<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.000> can
