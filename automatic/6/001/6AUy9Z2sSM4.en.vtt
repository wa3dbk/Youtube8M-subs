00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
as the bass but if you look in the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.179 
as the bass but if you look in the
instruction<00:01:02.399> booklet<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:04.199> says<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
instruction booklet it actually says it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
instruction booklet it actually says it
has<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> backstory<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
has a little bit of backstory and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.859 
has a little bit of backstory and
actually<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.409> refer<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.869> Vanilla's

I believe which obviously if you take a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.140 
I believe which obviously if you take a
look<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:14.010> some<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.310> screenshots<00:01:14.610> here

so yeah the game was a really ahead of
its<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> graphics<00:01:56.700> were<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.240> good

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
its time the graphics were really good

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.899 
its time the graphics were really good
at<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.040> me<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.700> was<00:01:59.880> one

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
at the time it really to me it was one

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
at the time it really to me it was one
of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> first<00:02:00.509> few<00:02:00.869> games<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.380> said<00:02:01.649> oh

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of the first few games that I said oh

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.760 
of the first few games that I said oh

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this is a capcom game and I believe it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130

one<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> few<00:02:05.850> games<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.210> define<00:02:06.630> Capcom

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
one of the few games that define Capcom

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.630 
one of the few games that define Capcom
right<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.469> beginning<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> lot<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
right in the beginning there's a lot to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.369 
right in the beginning there's a lot to
other<00:02:08.789> games<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.539> buying<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> command<00:02:10.229> have

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
other games but buying a command have

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.589 
other games but buying a command have
definitely<00:02:10.679> thought

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
definitely thought

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.300 
definitely thought
