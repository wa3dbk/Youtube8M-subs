00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.830 
I'm really pleased with the interest in
words<00:04:49.940> in<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.180> dust<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:51.140> am<00:04:51.530> thrilled<00:04:52.400> that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
words in the dust and I am thrilled that

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.600 
words in the dust and I am thrilled that
so<00:04:53.840> many<00:04:53.900> readers<00:04:54.320> have<00:04:54.740> responded<00:04:55.280> so

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
so many readers have responded so

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.970 
so many readers have responded so
positively<00:04:55.640> not<00:04:56.630> just<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> book<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:57.920> I

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
positively not just to the book but I

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.540 
positively not just to the book but I
think<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:59.180> mission<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.710> helping

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
think to the mission in helping

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.870 
think to the mission in helping
Afghanistan<00:05:01.910> get<00:05:02.390> back<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:03.610> something<00:05:04.610> much

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
Afghanistan get back to something much

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.940 
Afghanistan get back to something much
much<00:05:05.180> better<00:05:05.420> than<00:05:05.600> it<00:05:05.840> has<00:05:06.080> been<00:05:06.350> throughout

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
much better than it has been throughout

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.240 
much better than it has been throughout
the<00:05:07.130> wars<00:05:07.340> it's<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.010> campaign<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.190> is

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
the wars it's this is a campaign this is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.730 
the wars it's this is a campaign this is
a<00:05:10.370> mission<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:11.030> has<00:05:11.090> touched<00:05:11.990> all<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.440> our

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
a mission that has touched all of our

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.560 
a mission that has touched all of our
lives<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:13.220> don't<00:05:13.250> think<00:05:13.610> there's<00:05:13.820> anyone<00:05:14.360> who

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
lives I don't think there's anyone who

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.420 
lives I don't think there's anyone who
doesn't<00:05:14.750> know<00:05:14.900> someone<00:05:15.290> who's<00:05:15.980> closely

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
doesn't know someone who's closely

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.920 
doesn't know someone who's closely
affected<00:05:16.820> by<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.750> been<00:05:17.900> very

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
affected by this so it's been very

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.620 
affected by this so it's been very
gratifying<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.860> see<00:05:19.280> such<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.030> strong<00:05:20.300> interest

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
gratifying to see such a strong interest

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.040 
gratifying to see such a strong interest
in<00:05:21.470> helping<00:05:21.770> Afghanistan<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.760> in<00:05:23.270> wars<00:05:23.900> in
