the<00:02:10.869> three-quarter<00:02:11.470> inch<00:02:12.180> spot<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.440> this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the three-quarter inch spot like so this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.400 
the three-quarter inch spot like so this
will<00:02:17.799> be<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> little<00:02:18.160> small<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.750> make

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
will be a little small you can just make

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.160 
will be a little small you can just make
it<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.769> larger<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.519> want<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.750> this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it a little larger if you want but this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.479 
it a little larger if you want but this
works<00:02:23.470> totally<00:02:23.709> fine<00:02:26.099> since<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.190> know<00:02:27.250> it's

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
works totally fine since I know it's

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.740 
works totally fine since I know it's
going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.819> little<00:02:28.000> bit<00:02:28.150> small<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.599> just

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
going to be a little bit small I'm just

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
going to be a little bit small I'm just
going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.079> little<00:02:29.319> bit<00:02:29.530> above<00:02:29.890> where

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
going to go a little bit above where

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.180 
going to go a little bit above where
those<00:02:30.340> marks<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:33.690> oops<00:02:34.690> my<00:02:35.260> line<00:02:35.470> did<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.890> end

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
those marks are oops my line did not end

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.949 
those marks are oops my line did not end
up<00:02:36.910> very<00:02:37.060> dark<00:02:37.329> right<00:02:37.540> there<00:02:42.329> now<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.599> get<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
up very dark right there now to get the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.900 
up very dark right there now to get the
actual<00:02:44.319> square<00:02:44.739> shape<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:45.370> need<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.549> go<00:02:45.760> from

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
actual square shape we need to go from

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.759 
actual square shape we need to go from
the<00:02:46.030> other<00:02:46.180> side<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.019> do<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> same

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the other side now and do the same

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:58.340 
the other side now and do the same
process

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.560 

so<00:02:59.010> we're<00:02:59.130> making<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.520> grid<00:02:59.850> pattern<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
so we're making a grid pattern on the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:20.099 
so we're making a grid pattern on the
back<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.960> our<00:03:01.290> lilly<00:03:01.860> pilly<00:03:02.100> sheet

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.330 

now<00:03:21.109> when<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.319> get<00:03:21.439> to<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> very<00:03:21.680> end<00:03:22.040> it's

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
now when you get to the very end it's

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.670 
now when you get to the very end it's
going<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.579> be<00:03:22.879> even<00:03:23.749> here<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:24.379> you're<00:03:24.499> going<00:03:24.620> to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
going to be even here so you're going to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.500 
going to be even here so you're going to
be<00:03:24.739> able<00:03:24.769> get<00:03:24.950> two<00:03:25.159> more<00:03:25.280> squares<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:25.999> you<00:03:26.060> can

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
be able get two more squares so you can

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.670 
be able get two more squares so you can
tell<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.719> here<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.139> have<00:03:27.230> an<00:03:27.319> inch<00:03:27.469> and<00:03:27.650> a

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
tell that here we have an inch and a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.349 
tell that here we have an inch and a
half<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:28.159> course<00:03:28.639> you<00:03:28.730> divide<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.329> half

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
half of course you divide that in half

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.660 
half of course you divide that in half
and<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:29.930> three<00:03:30.139> quarters<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.530> an<00:03:30.709> inch<00:03:30.799> so

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
and it's three quarters of an inch so

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.690 
and it's three quarters of an inch so
this<00:03:31.849> is<00:03:31.879> going<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> be<00:03:32.359> perfect<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.459> we're<00:03:37.609> not

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
this is going to be perfect so we're not

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.559 
this is going to be perfect so we're not
going<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.939> have<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.209> make<00:03:38.359> another

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
going to have to make another

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.729 
going to have to make another
measurement<00:03:38.989> there<00:03:39.260> we're<00:03:39.379> just<00:03:39.530> going<00:03:39.709> to

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
measurement there we're just going to

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.369 
measurement there we're just going to
know<00:03:39.889> that<00:03:40.069> that's<00:03:40.159> what<00:03:40.430> that's<00:03:40.579> going<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.879> be

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.750 

so<00:03:48.379> if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.829> see<00:03:49.040> now<00:03:49.219> it<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:49.489> be<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.609> little

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
so if you can see now it can be a little

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.339 
so if you can see now it can be a little
hard<00:03:50.000> with<00:03:50.090> reflection<00:03:50.659> we've<00:03:50.840> got<00:03:51.019> actually

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
hard with reflection we've got actually

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.729 
hard with reflection we've got actually
eight<00:03:51.560> squares<00:03:52.280> all<00:03:52.579> lined<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.659> so<00:03:54.530> I'm<00:03:54.620> going

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
eight squares all lined up so I'm going

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.179 
eight squares all lined up so I'm going
to<00:03:54.769> take<00:03:54.889> my<00:03:55.069> metal<00:03:55.370> shears<00:03:55.989> unlock<00:03:56.989> them<00:03:57.260> and

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
to take my metal shears unlock them and

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.780 
to take my metal shears unlock them and
I<00:03:58.310> am<00:03:58.430> just<00:03:58.609> going<00:03:58.939> to<00:03:59.060> cut<00:03:59.269> these<00:03:59.480> out<00:04:00.790> along

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
I am just going to cut these out along

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:29.250 
I am just going to cut these out along
the<00:04:02.030> line<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.629> drew

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.050 

all<00:04:30.260> right<00:04:30.380> now<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.280> can<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.610> we've<00:04:31.760> got<00:04:31.880> all

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
all right now you can see we've got all

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.940 
all right now you can see we've got all
these<00:04:32.180> little<00:04:32.360> squares<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.050> some<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.800> them

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
these little squares and some of them

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.370 
these little squares and some of them
are<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.160> little<00:04:34.250> bit<00:04:34.900> crumpled<00:04:35.900> looking<00:04:36.230> you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
are a little bit crumpled looking you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.780 
are a little bit crumpled looking you
know<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:36.620> their<00:04:36.800> corners<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.280> bent-up<00:04:37.550> all

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
know just their corners of bent-up all

know just their corners of bent-up all
you<00:04:38.090> need<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.450> do<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:39.020> such<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.290> thin

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
you need to do this is such a thin

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.710 
you need to do this is such a thin
sheeting<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.730> don't<00:04:41.000> need<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.180> hammer<00:04:41.420> it<00:04:41.570> out

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
sheeting you don't need to hammer it out

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480 
sheeting you don't need to hammer it out
all<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.290> need<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.470> do<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.770> take<00:04:42.950> your<00:04:43.100> fingers

in<00:04:57.290> place<00:04:57.410> I'm<00:04:57.980> just<00:04:58.790> going<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:58.940> take<00:04:59.090> some

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
in place I'm just going to take some

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.570 
in place I'm just going to take some
e6000<00:05:00.290> now<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.770> have<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:00.920> toothpick<00:05:01.400> or

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
scrap piece of wire you want to use as a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.830 
scrap piece of wire you want to use as a
applicator<00:05:03.770> great<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.490> not<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.570> can<00:05:05.660> actually
