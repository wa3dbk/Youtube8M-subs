00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and it's probably his most powerful tool

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.919 
and it's probably his most powerful tool
is<00:01:59.490> his<00:01:59.610> ability<00:01:59.789> to<00:02:00.060> possess<00:02:00.240> these<00:02:00.569> things

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
is his ability to possess these things

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.710 
is his ability to possess these things
and<00:02:01.350> while<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> can't<00:02:02.369> directly<00:02:02.849> control

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and while you can't directly control

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.359 
and while you can't directly control
human<00:02:04.080> beings<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.069> some<00:02:05.340> really

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
human beings you have some really

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.430 
human beings you have some really
incredible<00:02:05.910> powers<00:02:06.599> over<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.289> look

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
incredible powers over them you can look

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.050 
incredible powers over them you can look
through<00:02:07.470> their<00:02:07.709> eyes<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.729> hear<00:02:08.880> through

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
through their eyes you can hear through

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120 
through their eyes you can hear through
their<00:02:09.119> ears<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:10.140> influence<00:02:10.800> their

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
their ears you can influence their

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.559 
their ears you can influence their
behavior<00:02:11.220> very<00:02:11.700> slightly<00:02:12.060> read<00:02:12.390> their

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
behavior very slightly read their

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.370 
behavior very slightly read their
thoughts<00:02:12.599> things<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.290> nature

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110 

I<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> player<00:02:17.490> being<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> little<00:02:17.940> lost

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I think the player being a little lost

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.240 
I think the player being a little lost
is<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> good<00:02:18.540> thing<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.140> think<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:19.950> fun<00:02:20.220> for

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
is a good thing I think it's fun for

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.340 
is a good thing I think it's fun for
them<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.610> come<00:02:20.850> into<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> space<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.750> go<00:02:21.960> oh<00:02:21.990> man

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
them to come into a space and go oh man

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.750 
them to come into a space and go oh man
I<00:02:22.380> gotta<00:02:22.650> figure<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.550> that's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I gotta figure this out because that's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580 
I gotta figure this out because that's
what's<00:02:23.910> Ronan's<00:02:24.270> thinking<00:02:24.600> as<00:02:24.720> well<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
what's Ronan's thinking as well if the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.870 
what's Ronan's thinking as well if the
player<00:02:25.770> comes<00:02:25.980> into<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> spacing<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:26.850> I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
player comes into the spacing is all I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.160 
player comes into the spacing is all I
already<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.300> all<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.050> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
already know all of this then it's just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
already know all of this then it's just
it's<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:29.010> through<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> motions<00:02:29.640> but

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
it's about going through the motions but

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
it's about going through the motions but
if<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.450> ask<00:02:30.690> them<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.200> make<00:02:31.530> some<00:02:32.220> decisions

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
if you ask them to make some decisions

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.460 
if you ask them to make some decisions
how<00:02:33.240> force<00:02:33.570> them<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.960> some<00:02:34.140> lateral

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
how force them to do some lateral

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.920 
how force them to do some lateral
thinking<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.580> hommo<00:02:36.060> once<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.630> figure

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
thinking that a hommo once they figure

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.910 
thinking that a hommo once they figure
it<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.320> becomes<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.740> much<00:02:37.800> more

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it out it becomes that much more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.500 
it out it becomes that much more
gratifying<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:39.470> lot<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.620> our<00:02:40.880> prototyping<00:02:41.880> was

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
gratifying a lot of our prototyping was

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.710 
gratifying a lot of our prototyping was
around<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.490> make<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.180> interesting

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
around how do you make it interesting

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
around how do you make it interesting
for<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.230> player<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.130> investigation

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
for the player to do an investigation

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
for the player to do an investigation
and<00:02:47.940> come<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.210> those<00:02:48.330> conclusions<00:02:48.800> themselves

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and come to those conclusions themselves

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.280 
and come to those conclusions themselves
as<00:02:50.280> opposed<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:50.820> handing<00:02:51.450> them<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
as opposed to just handing them the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.320 
as opposed to just handing them the
exact<00:02:52.650> answer<00:02:52.890> when<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.430> when<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.760> manage<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
exact answer when you when you manage to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.030 
exact answer when you when you manage to
gather<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.140> know<00:02:55.230> four<00:02:55.560> different<00:02:55.830> things

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
gather you know four different things

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.840 
gather you know four different things
that<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> need<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> mechanic<00:02:59.250> in

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
that you need it we have a mechanic in

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.330 
that you need it we have a mechanic in
the<00:02:59.910> game<00:03:00.210> where<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.100> take

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the game where you you have to take

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.740 
the game where you you have to take
complex<00:03:02.670> thoughts<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.690> to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
complex thoughts and you have to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.030 
complex thoughts and you have to
organize<00:03:04.170> them<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> way<00:03:04.620> that'll<00:03:04.860> make

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
organize them in a way that'll make

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.890 
organize them in a way that'll make
sense<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> character<00:03:06.210> Ronan<00:03:06.570> great

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
sense to the character Ronan great

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.960 
sense to the character Ronan great
example<00:03:07.350> would<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.980> need<00:03:08.190> someone<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
example would be you need someone to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.130 
example would be you need someone to
think<00:03:09.150> about<00:03:09.330> something<00:03:09.600> where<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.960> need

someone to move in a particular way but

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
you can't directly say hey move this you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.960 
you can't directly say hey move this you
have<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.990> basically<00:03:16.350> put<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.310> thought<00:03:17.640> into

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
have to basically put a thought into

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.850 
have to basically put a thought into
their<00:03:18.090> head<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> witness<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.560> one<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:19.800> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
crime scenes she's too distraught to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
crime scenes she's too distraught to

articulate what she saw to a police
officer<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:25.170> your<00:03:25.560> own<00:03:25.890> memory<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.640> a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
officer but your own memory of a

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.570 
officer but your own memory of a
conversation<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.290> overheard<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:29.460> be

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
conversation that you overheard can be

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.670 
conversation that you overheard can be
put<00:03:29.790> into<00:03:29.970> her<00:03:30.180> head<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.660> when<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.470> that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
put into her head and when you do that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.220 
put into her head and when you do that
it<00:03:31.890> breaks<00:03:32.430> free<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.970> data<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.900> she<00:03:33.960> can

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
it breaks free the data and so she can

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.840 
it breaks free the data and so she can
think<00:03:34.440> about<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.490> get<00:03:35.760> this

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
think about it and you get this

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.820 
think about it and you get this
information<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.570> her<00:03:36.690> own<00:03:36.810> thoughts<00:03:37.200> even

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
when we were brainstorming locations for

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.610 
when we were brainstorming locations for
the<00:03:44.160> game<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.580> we<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.390> first<00:03:45.720> looked<00:03:46.260> for

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
the game we we we first looked for

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.760

places<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:47.160> had<00:03:47.720> really<00:03:48.720> deep<00:03:48.959> supernatural

history and lore behind them and very

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.330 
history and lore behind them and very
quickly<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:54.150> realized<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.690> Salem<00:03:55.340> history

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340

do and and just really be excited about
this<00:05:29.490> our<00:05:29.730> own<00:05:30.030> kind<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.480> personal<00:05:30.900> take<00:05:31.110> on

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
this our own kind of personal take on

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.310 
this our own kind of personal take on
ghost<00:05:31.680> war<00:05:32.010> because<00:05:32.880> while<00:05:33.600> go<00:05:33.780> slower<00:05:34.020> sort

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
ghost war because while go slower sort

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.350 
ghost war because while go slower sort
of<00:05:34.380> universal<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:35.130> think<00:05:35.490> our<00:05:35.700> interpretation

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
of universal I think our interpretation

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.790 
of universal I think our interpretation
of<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.540> is<00:05:36.660> really<00:05:36.990> original<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.740> think
