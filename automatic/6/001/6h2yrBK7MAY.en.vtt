00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
video for starters you can drag one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
video for starters you can drag one
finger<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.750> move<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> cursor<00:00:34.200> something<00:00:35.190> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
finger to move the cursor something like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.889 
finger to move the cursor something like
this<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> cursor<00:00:36.600> moving<00:00:37.579> okay<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.899> then

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
this see the cursor moving okay and then

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.819 
this see the cursor moving okay and then
you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:40.680> use<00:00:41.489> two<00:00:41.730> fingers<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> drag

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
you can also use two fingers to drag

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
you can also use two fingers to drag
faster<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.910> gives<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:45.360> option<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have more precise movements for precise

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
have more precise movements for precise
edits<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> quicker<00:00:49.079> movements<00:00:49.500> where<00:00:49.649> needed

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
edits and quicker movements where needed
