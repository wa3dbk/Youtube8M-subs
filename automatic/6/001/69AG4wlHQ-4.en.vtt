00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 We have to keep working. 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.550
 Conda as the first photo of the first 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 in the first round playing with the same 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.840
 head with the same humility as 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.020
 equilibrium has the same equilibrium with 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.869
 I was gaining my foot on the ground now. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 also in defeat know also to have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.670
 balance so we can stay the same 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 pace keep attacking do what the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 people were doing what comes in and who 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 goes right 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 The team is our group, it's very strong, right? 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 team continues the same thing right 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.350
 Alex is an experience guy will help 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.649
 enough 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.170
 I get common in a not warning because 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 We are all adaptation, then when 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 I went up I had to adapt now I'm going 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 have to adapt me more than the brands 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 are getting stronger are already 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 making a markup scheme then 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.850
 I have to adapt if I move more 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.980
 there is always a side cover and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 steering wheel then you have to adapt 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 move more stay change pretty 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 dorival has already advanced a lot of young boy 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.400
 to play then he knows he knows 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 what are you talking about then I received then 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.259
 has a positive point in all this that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.189
 he speaks a thousand I have to have that me 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.000
 Now adjust the labeling of defenders 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.320
 a flyer then you have to name more 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.330
 participate more in the game 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.799
 I will continue to change position, it is not 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 because we can not stay very long 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.750
 stopped marking which facilitates 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.700
 believes and keeps changing 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 people talk a lot in concentration 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.220
 it will be quiet 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.680
 nor believed in ninth in the competition but 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 now everyone knows our value 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 average quality so independent 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.049
 was elastic or did not we win 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.219
 always win because we wavered in the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.710
 beginning of the game is more can have a side 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.439
 Good, it has happened now, we already 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.040
 learned now does not happen anymore 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.229
 we come strong in the final of the river bowl 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.520
 the Flemish is obliged to always win 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.220
 I was accustomed to winning titles 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.750
 it was always our focus our goal to 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.910
 We have to continue working on the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 our group is good is strong that things 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.990
 will happen naturally 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.130
 I think working as we come 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.810
 Working, we will arrive later. 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.720
 strong in the river bowl 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.910
 not only does this happen with a 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.100
 central pass before the games without making 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.850
 Goal is normal, one hour the ball will come in 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.010
 of course I'm there I always go the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.990
 helping to try and help with the pass and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.610
 background crossing this is normal 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.120
 one hour the ball will come in does not have 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.620
 mystery is not clear or the marking does not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 not giving much space right? 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.200
 As I said I have to adapt and that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.060
 have to find other ways to pass 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.250
 of blocking the movement 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.480
 pretty nÃ© moving side to the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 another will facilitate 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.880
