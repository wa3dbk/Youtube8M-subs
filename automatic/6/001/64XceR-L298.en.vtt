00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to be desired to be perfectly frank but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.770 
to be desired to be perfectly frank but
I<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:34.680> say<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.040> overall<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> nice<00:00:36.000> thing

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I would say it's overall a nice thing

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.959 
I would say it's overall a nice thing
especially<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> price<00:00:37.760> it's<00:00:38.760> basically

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
especially for the price it's basically

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.420 
especially for the price it's basically
considering<00:00:39.390> nicer<00:00:39.870> ones<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> have

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
considering nicer ones that have

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
considering nicer ones that have
microphones<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.170> from

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
microphones that would actually go from

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.090 
microphones that would actually go from
your<00:00:43.680> ear<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.250> mouth<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> price<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
your ear to your mouth and the price of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.689 
your ear to your mouth and the price of
those<00:00:47.219> being<00:00:48.469> $70<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.649> worse<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.780> bad<00:00:52.699> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
those being $70 or worse it's not bad so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
those being $70 or worse it's not bad so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
you know on top of the ear hole so I can

listen without kind of jabbing something

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.180 
listen without kind of jabbing something
in<00:03:01.350> my<00:03:01.470> ear<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.859> hurting<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.769> don't<00:03:05.070> have

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
in my ear and hurting it it I don't have

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190 
in my ear and hurting it it I don't have
a<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.640> me<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.030> got<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> spare<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:06.959> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
a with me but it's got a spare one of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.620 
a with me but it's got a spare one of
these<00:03:07.290> ear<00:03:07.769> clips<00:03:08.070> as<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.000> believe

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
these ear clips as well that I believe

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.130 
these ear clips as well that I believe
it<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.350> bends<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.870> slightly

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
it actually bends in a slightly

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
it actually bends in a slightly
different<00:03:13.260> way<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:16.230> example<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.000> this

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
different way the for example this this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.059 
different way the for example this this
way<00:03:18.209> instead<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.950> might

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
way instead of this way so it might

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.069 
way instead of this way so it might
actually<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:21.060> one<00:03:21.299> might<00:03:21.540> actually<00:03:21.780> be

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
actually that one might actually be

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.009 
actually that one might actually be
better<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:23.239> wearing<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.600> ear<00:03:24.840> like

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
better for wearing on the right ear like

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.309 
better for wearing on the right ear like
I<00:03:25.200> do<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.209> don't<00:03:30.480> know<00:03:30.630> personally<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
I do but I don't know personally I

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.530 
I do but I don't know personally I
haven't<00:03:31.889> had<00:03:32.100> much<00:03:32.310> issues<00:03:32.940> with<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.209> as<00:03:33.329> is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
haven't had much issues with it as is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.710 
haven't had much issues with it as is
although<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:35.519> text<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.000> kinda<00:03:36.540> does

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
although the text here kinda does

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.740 
although the text here kinda does
suggest<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.880> intended<00:03:38.880> for<00:03:38.910> lefty<00:03:39.630> or

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
suggest that it is intended for lefty or

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.660 
suggest that it is intended for lefty or
wearing

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
wearing

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.759 
wearing
so<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> couple<00:03:41.880> other<00:03:42.030> things<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:43.350> microphone

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
so a couple other things the microphone

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.190 
so a couple other things the microphone
is<00:03:43.950> right<00:03:44.790> here<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> front<00:03:45.389> let's<00:03:45.840> zoom<00:03:46.049> in

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
is right here in the front let's zoom in

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.860 
is right here in the front let's zoom in
again<00:03:46.350> quickly

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.839 

and<00:03:51.530> stay<00:03:51.800> in<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.040> perfect<00:03:52.340> focus<00:03:52.489> range

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
and stay in the perfect focus range

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.089 
and stay in the perfect focus range
microphone<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.870> here<00:03:54.379> in<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> front<00:03:54.680> once

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
microphone is here in the front once

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.850 
microphone is here in the front once
again<00:03:55.400> kind<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.910> small<00:03:56.150> one<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> quality

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
again kind of a small one so the quality

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.130 
again kind of a small one so the quality
probably<00:03:58.580> isn't<00:03:58.940> going<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.120> be<00:03:59.239> too<00:03:59.420> amazing

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
probably isn't going to be too amazing

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.390 
probably isn't going to be too amazing
compared<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.590> what<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.830> might<00:04:00.950> find<00:04:01.190> on

compared to what you might find on
fancier<00:04:01.940> devices<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.019> fancier<00:04:03.769> phones<00:04:04.090> but

kind<00:04:13.640> of<00:04:13.700> versatile<00:04:14.150> like<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.690> lot<00:04:15.049> of<00:04:15.170> mobile

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
kind of versatile like a lot of mobile

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.680 
kind of versatile like a lot of mobile

not a bit I don't have it in front of me
and<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.270> probably<00:04:23.300> isn't<00:04:23.900> worth<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.290> to<00:04:24.440> stop

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
and it probably isn't worth it to stop

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.370 
and it probably isn't worth it to stop
the<00:04:24.650> recording<00:04:24.889> go<00:04:25.460> grab<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.240> then<00:04:26.380> come
