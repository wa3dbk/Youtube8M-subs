00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 yes I think today we have that 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.680
 we may also be showing what we might be involved with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 his songs and become known 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.790
 much spielwitz also with a wide 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.259
 have breast and lots of self-confidence 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.970
 really impressive today 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.100
 from the first minute did not want to go back in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 the cabin sit ask us up 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.430
 the smooth first half today too 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 just perfect and we have then 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 Opportunities also used for luck two ago 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 then half time with the red card 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 the eleven-meter game more eaten 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.230
 I think that's just happy 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 that today we are perfect for the classes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 have made 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.540
 Anyone could be happy about that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.589
 to be better I'm very proud of it 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.379
 our unite on our team 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.729
 on our fans on all the helped 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.500
 have that made that possible that 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.540
 Everything is easy to communicate 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 mega successful season 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.159
 special grid 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.650
 game day before closing than the 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.690
 secured class is really moving 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 and a big compliment to ours 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.350
 team and giants are fantastic 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 made if super live gave this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.380
 season had a little bit where you are 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.609
 it was always more difficult together 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.539
 States and always believe in it 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.770
 that you can do and now is real 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.359
 happens 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 this is the same performance for me 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.320
 But honestly, wallis is like that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.520
 have brought that means in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.960
 the consequence more games next year 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 second league and that was one 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.530
 rising principle is the situation 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.780
 because really really happy and 5 1 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.429
 Does it really need that much? 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.700
 had set out whole week 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.689
 how you opponents play and rehabilitate and 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.609
 nice that of course everything implemented 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.399
 has been and that we have won 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:46.510
 of course, absolutely used 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.250
 sunday abs 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.210
 in no phase have done the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.820
 swing out of the home win in 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.000
 to take dÃ¼sseldorf here today 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.210
 has received from the beginning of larger club 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.210
 had 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:10.300
 We were too passive in many areas 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.950
 were then logically from the opponent 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.990
 I would like to punish the buckets 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.240
 congratulate to the final 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.240
 league sustaining 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.530
 and we know that we are two serious 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 tasks have against the home game against 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.560
 darmstadt and the away game at 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.350
 lawnball sports Leipzig but we know 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.900
 also that we do not present ourselves that way 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.050
 We can and will become the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.120
 Commitment to many people 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.560
 that's very emotional to this club 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.400
 close warmth commitment opposite 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.260
 the city and an obligation for us 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.950
 to be different in the coming week 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.380
 present 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.680
 thank goodness first of all he has 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.850
 had great respect from all hire 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.260
 also because of the last result 30 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.840
 it was somehow a game or a game 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.730
 result where much momentum can bring 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.709
 and we have the team with given 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.180
 on the way with may in no phase 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.800
 and and certainly not from the beginning 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.910
 like maybe in the last one 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.580
 have had home games 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 to be careless but want 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.420
 can defend aggressively forward 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.950
 also converted 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.500
 once on the opponent just reacts 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.360
 around this individual class the against it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.010
 also has to take out of the game 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.070
 but that alone is not enough but you 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.610
 must have the big sake just in 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.019
 every situation in the game in every phase 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.390
 the right thing to do there is the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.260
 head a big role and give mister x 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.630
 said that has my team 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.010
 we were very focused in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.840
 the defensive very robust very much 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.840
 powerful but also the rooms 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.180
 recognized 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.860
 which you have to play while I think 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 will have to go into the lead with 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.340
 the great chance of marc schnatterer as 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.989
 two players from each computer 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.200
 pulls the perfect flank brings and 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.310
 that you are actually empty but then 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.379
 finally one again 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
 standard situation or believes the third 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.370
 in a standard situation in the lead 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.019
 could go that was pure will in the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.730
 moment these two over line too 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.220
 press and of course just before the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 half time to make that 2 0 that 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.840
 helps you then in this phase and the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.090
 Team can be announced at the moment 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.250
 Keep up the important thing not less 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.040
 do not invest too deeply do not fall 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.260
 act too passive and then think 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.680
 with the 3 0 with the eleven meter of the red 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.040
 map 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.669
 because I was running the game too 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.770
 if old or german 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.630
 a great performance but still 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.740
 more we are now two star 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 game days before final 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.550
 great moments have secured had 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.350
 but also live where you saw that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.270
 in this league you also very fast 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.010
 it can be very tight 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.260
 They are insane results and know 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.639
 Now just glad that we have the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.080
 I have secured class preservation 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.880
 can also be proud of the team 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.220
 because we went away without 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.510
 We have a great deal of experience 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.740
 we were convinced of 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.220
 our way and we are often asked 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.710
 been 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.940
 is enough for the second league we have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.590
 At the beginning, we do not know 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.360
 but we are convinced and me 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.770
 think it showed that this 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.500
 team spirit that this cohesion 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.729
 has simply shown or clarified 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.410
 that we have the right decision 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.669
 also met once again a real one 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.710
 the lucky and easy to complete 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.210
 team not only the 11 or 14 3 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.460
 on the place to have the whole 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.410
 There was a great cohesion there 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.090
 and that's why we're so happy 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.560
 have achieved that and still want 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.840
 I'm about to lift my finger 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.400
 only two games was there first 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.260
 because we want to show good games 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.490
 the fans demand the double victory 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.440
 not easy but we will do it all 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.400
 do it for and you can see it in football 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.650
 is also on the opponent 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.650
 last year so close in the 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.030
 relegation and and this year to 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.280
 but it is still nothing there 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.840
 decided and therefore me and mine 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.919
 ex all of course, all the best we do 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.870
 will not let us down 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.650
 really try to score in the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.460
 last two play 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.460
 Thank you
