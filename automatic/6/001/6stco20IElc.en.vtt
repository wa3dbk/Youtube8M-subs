the<00:00:45.640> middle<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.000> pizzas<00:00:46.330> and<00:00:46.480> if<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.690> have<00:00:46.809> to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.110 
the middle the pizzas and if you have to
use<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.230> bottom<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:47.980> use<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.250> bottom<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:49.000> a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120

56 it actually can hold about 28 largest

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.720 
56 it actually can hold about 28 largest
so<00:00:53.800> about<00:00:54.040> 28<00:00:55.019> 16-inch<00:00:56.019> pizzas<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:57.129> you<00:00:57.580> can

so about 28 16-inch pizzas and you can
use<00:00:57.879> two<00:00:58.120> methods<00:00:58.540> actually<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:59.140> can<00:00:59.320> cook

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.880 
it buys on those or you can cook them on
just<00:01:05.650> appeal<00:01:06.070> by<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.320> flying<00:01:08.320> off<00:01:08.650> like

just appeal by like just flying off like

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.810 
just appeal by like just flying off like
that<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.979> I'm<00:01:12.070> gonna<00:01:12.159> go<00:01:12.340> ahead<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.550> click

that so I'm gonna go ahead and click

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.280 
that so I'm gonna go ahead and click
this<00:01:13.000> on<00:01:13.270> real<00:01:13.510> quick<00:01:13.780> if<00:01:13.990> you're<00:01:14.080> going<00:01:14.229> to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
this on real quick if you're going to

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.520 
this on real quick if you're going to
see<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.560> start<00:01:14.800> turning<00:01:15.190> in<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.370> minute

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.730 

and<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.160> rotates<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.760> direction<00:01:23.740> one

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and it rotates in this direction one

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.910 
and it rotates in this direction one
problem<00:01:25.130> people<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.610> actually<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.920> if

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
problem people can actually have is if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
problem people can actually have is if
you're<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.190> righty<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:28.880> very<00:01:29.120> simple<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.540> work

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
you're a righty it's very simple to work

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.910 
you're a righty it's very simple to work
these<00:01:29.900> ovens<00:01:30.260> because<00:01:30.590> they're<00:01:30.770> actually

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
these ovens because they're actually

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.050 
these ovens because they're actually
coming<00:01:31.340> at<00:01:31.580> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
coming at you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359 
coming at you
but<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> lefty<00:01:34.470> sometimes<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> tend

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
but if you're a lefty sometimes you tend

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.310 
but if you're a lefty sometimes you tend
to<00:01:35.460> hold<00:01:35.610> appeal<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
to hold appeal this way and it's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
to hold appeal this way and it's
actually<00:01:37.710> rotating<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.850> you're

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
actually rotating this way so you're

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.639 
actually rotating this way so you're
actually<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> working<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> oven<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
actually kind of working the oven this

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.810 
actually kind of working the oven this
way

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.700 

so<00:01:43.480> let<00:01:43.660> these<00:01:43.840> might<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.230> little<00:01:44.440> bit<00:01:44.560> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
so let these might have a little bit of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.600 
so let these might have a little bit of
a<00:01:44.770> problem<00:01:45.010> on<00:01:45.310> these<00:01:45.490> ovens<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.430> very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
a problem on these ovens and it's very

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.490 
a problem on these ovens and it's very
easily<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.090> break<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.570> kill<00:01:49.840> these<00:01:50.080> others

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
easily to break and kill these others

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.410 
easily to break and kill these others
that's<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.070> big<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:51.520> you'll<00:01:51.820> see<00:01:52.030> under<00:01:52.270> here

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that's one big two you'll see under here

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.600 
that's one big two you'll see under here
there's<00:01:52.600> some<00:01:52.780> supports<00:01:53.290> so<00:01:54.160> when<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.460> look

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
there's some supports so when you look

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.100 
there's some supports so when you look
at<00:01:54.730> a<00:01:54.790> bottom<00:01:55.120> of<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.300> pizza<00:01:55.540> sometimes

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
at a bottom of the pizza sometimes

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.040 
at a bottom of the pizza sometimes
they'll<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:56.800> break<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.640> peel<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.840> that's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
they'll just break that peel so that's

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.360 
they'll just break that peel so that's
something<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.380> might<00:01:59.470> want<00:01:59.620> to<00:01:59.830> look<00:01:59.980> at<00:02:00.190> that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
something you might want to look at that

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.890 
something you might want to look at that
you<00:02:00.520> could<00:02:00.670> go<00:02:00.820> through<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:01.090> lot<00:02:01.210> of<00:02:01.240> peels<00:02:01.630> if

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
you could go through a lot of peels if

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.020 
you could go through a lot of peels if
somebody<00:02:02.230> that's<00:02:02.410> an<00:02:02.560> experienced<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.730> if

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
somebody that's an experienced and if

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.700 
somebody that's an experienced and if
you<00:02:04.150> have<00:02:04.300> somebody<00:02:04.510> who's<00:02:04.840> probably<00:02:05.380> under

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
you have somebody who's probably under

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.820 
you have somebody who's probably under
five<00:02:06.220> foot<00:02:06.520> or<00:02:06.820> maybe<00:02:07.060> five<00:02:07.420> -<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.649> really

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
five foot or maybe five - it's really

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.950 
five foot or maybe five - it's really
hard<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.280> look<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:09.670> see<00:02:09.880> how<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.510> top<00:02:10.750> deck

looks<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.470> move<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.740> down

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
looks can move it down

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.090 
looks can move it down
when<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.820> throw<00:02:13.970> your<00:02:14.000> pizzas<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:15.100> you

when you throw your pizzas in you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.430 
when you throw your pizzas in you
usually<00:02:16.280> throw<00:02:16.580> them<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.850> top<00:02:17.030> shelf<00:02:17.440> top

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
usually throw them on the top shelf top

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.560 
usually throw them on the top shelf top
hooks<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.830> top<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.220> pizzas<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:20.180> middles

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
hooks the top of the pizzas to middles

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.150 
hooks the top of the pizzas to middles
cook<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> middle<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.440> if<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.740> have<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.010> use

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
cook the middle and if you have to use

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790 
cook the middle and if you have to use
the<00:02:22.310> bottom<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.730> use<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> bottom<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the bottom to use the bottom this is so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.350 
the bottom to use the bottom this is so
hot<00:02:25.040> because<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.520> burner<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.910> actually<00:02:26.240> on

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
hot because the burner is actually on

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.930 
hot because the burner is actually on
the<00:02:26.540> bottom<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.560> bottom<00:02:28.010> rarely

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the bottom so this this bottom rarely

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
the bottom so this this bottom rarely
used<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.780> did<00:02:30.020> you'd<00:02:30.230> probably<00:02:30.320> use

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
used but if you did you'd probably use

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.460 
used but if you did you'd probably use
maybe<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> half<00:02:32.480> turn<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.020> slide<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
maybe like a half turn and slide that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.740 
maybe like a half turn and slide that
pizza<00:02:33.800> all<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.040> way<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.400> corner<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.510> when

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
pizza all the way to the corner so when

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.210 
pizza all the way to the corner so when
it<00:02:35.870> comes<00:02:36.020> back<00:02:36.200> around<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.710> bottom<00:02:36.890> will<00:02:37.100> be

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it comes back around that bottom will be

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.520 
it comes back around that bottom will be
really<00:02:37.550> nice<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.930> can<00:02:39.050> get<00:02:39.200> them<00:02:39.380> in

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
really nice you can get them in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.330 
really nice you can get them in
stainless<00:02:40.090> shelves<00:02:41.090> or<00:02:41.620> quarter-inch<00:02:42.620> stone

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
stainless shelves or quarter-inch stone

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.280 
stainless shelves or quarter-inch stone
show<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.060> whatever<00:02:44.360> index<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.750> want<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.110> get

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
show so whatever index you want you get

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
show so whatever index you want you get
them<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:46.090> metal<00:02:47.090> or<00:02:47.390> stone<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.380> think<00:02:48.830> he's<00:02:49.160> up

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
them in metal or stone I think he's up

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.950 
them in metal or stone I think he's up
into<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> best<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.180> maybe<00:02:50.330> we've<00:02:50.480> been<00:02:50.510> open

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
into the best that maybe we've been open

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.690 
into the best that maybe we've been open
for<00:02:51.260> or<00:02:51.710> actually<00:02:52.010> since<00:02:52.280> 1991<00:02:54.400> we<00:02:55.400> cranked

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
for or actually since 1991 we cranked

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.570 
for or actually since 1991 we cranked
out<00:02:55.820> about<00:02:56.120> 500<00:02:56.570> pizzas<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.020> Friday<00:02:57.320> night

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
out about 500 pizzas on a Friday night

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.670 
out about 500 pizzas on a Friday night
450<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.910> 500<00:02:59.150> 475<00:03:00.050> on

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
450 to 500 475 on

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.300 
450 to 500 475 on
and<00:03:01.549> I<00:03:02.209> think<00:03:03.109> out<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.349> any<00:03:03.530> oven<00:03:03.829> do<00:03:03.980> something

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and I think out of any oven do something

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.520 
and I think out of any oven do something
stuff<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.609> best<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.900> row<00:03:06.049> no<00:03:06.109> flex<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.500> can

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
stuff the best in a row no flex you can

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.190 
stuff the best in a row no flex you can
get<00:03:06.859> two<00:03:07.459> doors<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.150> even<00:03:08.450> three<00:03:08.750> doors<00:03:08.959> on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
get two doors and even three doors on

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.319 
get two doors and even three doors on
these<00:03:09.379> we<00:03:09.769> have<00:03:09.890> two<00:03:10.129> doors<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.030> our<00:03:11.120> pizzas

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
these we have two doors so our pizzas

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.420 
these we have two doors so our pizzas
actually<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.900> made<00:03:12.079> on<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.319> prep<00:03:12.530> table<00:03:12.920> we

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
actually get made on the prep table we

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.459 
actually get made on the prep table we
put<00:03:13.459> them<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:13.939> and<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:14.750> side<00:03:15.019> over<00:03:15.349> here

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
put them in and on this side over here

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.199 
put them in and on this side over here
on<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.739> other<00:03:15.950> side<00:03:16.099> we<00:03:16.879> have<00:03:16.969> a<00:03:17.000> guy<00:03:17.180> that's

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
on this other side we have a guy that's

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.300 
on this other side we have a guy that's
working<00:03:17.659> the<00:03:17.930> oven<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.439> puts<00:03:19.069> them<00:03:19.189> on<00:03:19.280> a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
table to cut now you can get an

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.039 
table to cut now you can get an
additional<00:03:22.310> third<00:03:22.579> window<00:03:23.000> they<00:03:23.599> call<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.959> a
