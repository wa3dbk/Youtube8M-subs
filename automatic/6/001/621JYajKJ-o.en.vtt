00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
that batch of figures is going is this

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.320 
that batch of figures is going is this
is<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.660> Marvel<00:00:27.020> now<00:00:27.230> Captain<00:00:27.740> America<00:00:28.250> as<00:00:29.060> far

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
is the Marvel now Captain America as far

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330 
is the Marvel now Captain America as far
as<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.570> can<00:00:29.720> tell<00:00:29.900> it's<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.140> completely<00:00:30.770> retooled

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
as I can tell it's a completely retooled

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.340 
as I can tell it's a completely retooled
figure<00:00:31.820> meaning<00:00:32.210> it's<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.419> brand<00:00:32.690> new<00:00:32.809> sculpt

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
figure meaning it's a brand new sculpt

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.780 
figure meaning it's a brand new sculpt
so<00:00:33.559> it's<00:00:33.680> not<00:00:33.739> really<00:00:33.980> technically<00:00:34.340> retooled

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
so it's not really technically retooled

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.580 
so it's not really technically retooled
I<00:00:34.970> guess<00:00:35.150> it's<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.600> new<00:00:36.110> tooling<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:38.590> that's

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
I guess it's a new tooling and that's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.470 
I guess it's a new tooling and that's
always<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.010> good<00:00:40.100> thing<00:00:40.520> or<00:00:40.790> almost<00:00:41.270> always

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
always a good thing or almost always

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.180 
always a good thing or almost always
when<00:00:41.780> they<00:00:41.900> make<00:00:42.050> a<00:00:42.080> new<00:00:42.320> sculpt<00:00:42.710> because<00:00:43.010> it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
when they make a new sculpt because it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.830 
when they make a new sculpt because it's
nice<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.399> not<00:00:43.730> have<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:44.030> bunch<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.630> same

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
nice to not have a bunch of the same

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.360 
nice to not have a bunch of the same
figure<00:00:45.230> line<00:00:45.380> or<00:00:45.560> hell<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:45.829> just<00:00:45.980> new<00:00:46.100> paint

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
figure line or hell it's just new paint

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.710 
figure line or hell it's just new paint
on<00:00:46.579> them<00:00:46.899> however<00:00:47.899> they<00:00:49.030> did<00:00:50.030> not<00:00:50.059> do

themselves themselves any favors with
this<00:00:54.530> guy<00:00:54.710> because<00:00:55.309> they<00:00:55.969> spent<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.420> money<00:00:56.450> on

this guy because they spent the money on

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.470 
this guy because they spent the money on

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
the tooling all new molds which is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.330 
the tooling all new molds which is
expensive<00:00:59.809> which<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:00.680> why<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.040> don't<00:01:01.160> get<00:01:01.280> a

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
expensive which is why we don't get a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.910 
expensive which is why we don't get a
whole<00:01:01.579> bunch<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:01.940> I<00:01:02.000> understand<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.920> but

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
whole bunch and I understand that but

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.690 
whole bunch and I understand that but
the<00:01:04.100> paint<00:01:04.399> is<00:01:04.670> just<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.830> not<00:01:06.830> good<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:07.460> this

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
shading anywhere first of all so all of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.690 
shading anywhere first of all so all of
this<00:01:14.479> texturing<00:01:15.080> throughout<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.040> chest<00:01:16.430> and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
this texturing throughout the chest and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.859 
this texturing throughout the chest and
the<00:01:17.330> arms<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:19.549> cloth<00:01:19.970> wrinkles<00:01:20.540> in<00:01:20.690> the

pants and then the details in the boots
it's<00:01:24.409> all<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.799> about<00:01:24.890> useless<00:01:25.490> because

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's all just about useless because

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.330 
it's all just about useless because
there's<00:01:26.180> no<00:01:26.420> paint<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.990> accentuate<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.830> you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
there's no paint to accentuate it you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.899 
there's no paint to accentuate it you
just<00:01:28.549> can't<00:01:28.729> even<00:01:28.790> tell<00:01:28.909> it's<00:01:29.150> there<00:01:29.360> really

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
just can't even tell it's there really

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.609 
just can't even tell it's there really
it's<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.270> disappointing<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.170> figure<00:01:33.409> could

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
it's so disappointing this figure could

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.670 
it's so disappointing this figure could
have<00:01:33.740> been<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:34.340> good<00:01:35.299> figure<00:01:35.540> if<00:01:35.900> not<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.290> really

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
have been a good figure if not a really

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.039 
have been a good figure if not a really
good<00:01:36.860> figure<00:01:37.189> with<00:01:37.430> better<00:01:37.640> paint<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.360> paint

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
good figure with better paint the paint

paint work on the arms I don't know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.170 
paint work on the arms I don't know
what's<00:01:51.320> going<00:01:51.590> on<00:01:51.710> with<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.070> there's<00:01:52.970> like

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
what's going on with that there's like

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.060 
what's going on with that there's like
white<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.780> guess<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.140> was<00:01:54.320> molded<00:01:54.680> in<00:01:54.770> white

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
white I guess it was molded in white

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.890 
white I guess it was molded in white
which<00:01:55.460> would<00:01:55.610> make<00:01:55.790> sense<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
which would make sense but then the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.039 
which would make sense but then the
paint<00:01:57.170> work<00:01:57.350> for<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.680> blue<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:57.920> gray<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.460> just

paint work for the blue and gray is just

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.539 
paint work for the blue and gray is just
not<00:02:00.049> there<00:02:00.409> it's<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:00.770> good<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.220> paint<00:02:01.430> work

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
actually really pretty solid it's just

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.030 
actually really pretty solid it's just
the<00:03:55.730> paint<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:56.450> there<00:03:56.750> or<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.380> really<00:03:57.739> bad

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
the paint is not there or is really bad

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.770 
the paint is not there or is really bad
so<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.489> really<00:03:58.940> detracts<00:03:59.239> from<00:03:59.330> this<00:03:59.660> guy

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
so it really detracts from this guy

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.710 
so it really detracts from this guy
makes<00:03:59.989> him<00:04:00.140> feel<00:04:00.290> super<00:04:00.830> cheap<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.610> it's<00:04:02.510> just

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
makes him feel super cheap and it's just

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.110 
makes him feel super cheap and it's just
not<00:04:02.870> good<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.290> head<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.680> me<00:04:03.860> is<00:04:04.190> too<00:04:04.550> fat<00:04:04.820> I

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
not good the head to me is too fat I

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.030 
not good the head to me is too fat I
know<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:05.750> looks<00:04:06.020> like<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.320> Marvel<00:04:06.650> now<00:04:06.770> cap

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
know it looks like the Marvel now cap

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.979 
know it looks like the Marvel now cap
and<00:04:07.400> his<00:04:07.730> head<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.209> wider<00:04:08.630> than

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
and his head is a little wider than

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.040 
and his head is a little wider than
normal<00:04:09.200> at<00:04:10.040> least<00:04:10.070> that's<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> way<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.580> see<00:04:10.940> it

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
normal at least that's the way I see it

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.170 
normal at least that's the way I see it
this<00:04:12.050> one<00:04:12.290> just<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.739> looks<00:04:13.040> off<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.910> don't<00:04:14.090> know

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100

isn't<00:05:55.630> boot<00:05:55.750> swivel<00:05:56.230> and<00:05:56.440> then<00:05:56.950> he<00:05:57.040> has<00:05:57.190> these

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
isn't boot swivel and then he has these

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.130 
isn't boot swivel and then he has these
standard<00:05:57.850> ankles<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.390> have<00:05:58.480> to<00:05:58.600> really<00:05:58.810> force

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
standard ankles you have to really force

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.990 
standard ankles you have to really force
him<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.350> get<00:05:59.530> them<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.680> go<00:05:59.800> forward<00:06:00.070> though<00:06:00.460> and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
him to get them to go forward though and

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.690 
him to get them to go forward though and
he<00:06:01.210> does<00:06:01.390> have<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.750> ankle<00:06:02.260> rocker<00:06:02.560> so<00:06:02.980> you

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
he does have the ankle rocker so you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.270 
he does have the ankle rocker so you
know<00:06:03.820> this<00:06:04.660> is<00:06:04.870> one<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.050> those<00:06:05.200> cases<00:06:05.530> where<00:06:06.010> if

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
know this is one of those cases where if

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.760 
know this is one of those cases where if
the<00:06:06.880> paint<00:06:07.150> had<00:06:07.360> been<00:06:07.540> really<00:06:07.990> good<00:06:08.200> the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
the paint had been really good the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.590 
the paint had been really good the
figure<00:06:09.220> would<00:06:09.460> have<00:06:09.610> looked<00:06:09.760> really<00:06:10.390> good

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
figure would have looked really good

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.840 
figure would have looked really good
because<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.590> sculpt<00:06:11.950> is<00:06:12.040> definitely<00:06:12.580> there

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
because the sculpt is definitely there

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.840 
because the sculpt is definitely there
despite<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.660> few<00:06:13.870> flaws<00:06:14.140> in<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.980> design<00:06:15.010> of

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
despite the few flaws in the design of

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.480 
despite the few flaws in the design of
the<00:06:15.970> figure<00:06:16.270> a<00:06:16.650> really<00:06:17.650> good<00:06:17.830> paint<00:06:18.100> job<00:06:18.190> would

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
the figure a really good paint job would

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.640 
the figure a really good paint job would
have<00:06:18.580> made<00:06:18.730> this<00:06:18.880> guy<00:06:19.030> look<00:06:19.300> fantastic

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
have made this guy look fantastic

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.560 
have made this guy look fantastic
absolutely<00:06:20.650> great<00:06:21.060> whereas<00:06:22.060> what<00:06:22.300> we<00:06:22.330> have

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
absolutely great whereas what we have

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.830 
absolutely great whereas what we have
now<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:23.770> has<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:23.980> horrible<00:06:24.520> paint<00:06:24.820> job<00:06:25.060> so<00:06:25.720> it

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
now it has a horrible paint job so it

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.360 
now it has a horrible paint job so it
makes<00:06:25.990> him<00:06:26.110> look<00:06:26.230> even<00:06:26.380> worse<00:06:26.770> than<00:06:27.130> it<00:06:27.250> really

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
makes him look even worse than it really

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.640 
makes him look even worse than it really
should<00:06:27.520> so<00:06:28.060> it's<00:06:28.270> really<00:06:28.630> disappointing<00:06:28.900> and

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
should so it's really disappointing and

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.800 
should so it's really disappointing and
I<00:06:30.250> have<00:06:30.340> to<00:06:30.460> say<00:06:30.640> with<00:06:31.150> as<00:06:31.300> many<00:06:31.420> Captain
