00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
going to do is just grind these to a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:51.449 
going to do is just grind these to a
paste<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.830> add<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.250> our<00:02:42.700> flour<00:02:50.459> now

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459

once all those pieces are broken up much

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.539 
once all those pieces are broken up much
smaller<00:02:55.350> which<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.500> basically<00:02:56.980> left<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.430> a
