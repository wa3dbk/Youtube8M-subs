strips so I'll take that bit off cuz

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.240 
strips so I'll take that bit off cuz
that'd<00:00:37.699> be<00:00:37.850> what<00:00:37.970> B<00:00:38.150> is<00:00:38.210> neat<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.890> we'll<00:00:40.010> cut

that'd be what B is neat so we'll cut

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.390 
that'd be what B is neat so we'll cut
these<00:00:40.400> into<00:00:40.729> strips<00:00:41.799> if<00:00:42.799> you<00:00:42.890> want<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.250> measure

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
these into strips if you want to measure

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.840 
these into strips if you want to measure
them<00:00:43.640> together<00:00:43.879> even<00:00:44.690> than<00:00:45.589> mine<00:00:45.769> that's<00:00:46.010> fine

so<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.039> one's<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.369> little<00:01:10.460> bit<00:01:10.579> wider<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.000> I'll

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
so this one's a little bit wider so I'll

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.639 
so this one's a little bit wider so I'll
just<00:01:11.359> try<00:01:11.479> stretching<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.170> little<00:01:12.229> bit<00:01:12.500> see

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
just try stretching it a little bit see

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.279 
just try stretching it a little bit see
if<00:01:12.679> we<00:01:12.829> can<00:01:12.979> make<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.310> little<00:01:13.399> bit<00:01:13.640> thinner

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.639 

same<00:01:18.289> with<00:01:18.469> this<00:01:18.619> one<00:01:18.679> I<00:01:20.109> might<00:01:21.109> want<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.380> do<00:01:21.499> is

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
same with this one I might want to do is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.279 
same with this one I might want to do is
just<00:01:21.829> roll<00:01:22.149> across<00:01:23.149> push<00:01:23.630> those<00:01:23.869> into<00:01:24.079> my

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
just roll across push those into my

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.649 
just roll across push those into my
fondant<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:29.619> okay<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.450> when<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.630> use

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
fondant like so okay and when you use

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.709 
fondant like so okay and when you use
the<00:01:32.899> little<00:01:33.049> round<00:01:33.319> cutter<00:01:34.299> I'm<00:01:35.299> gonna<00:01:35.479> cut

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
the little round cutter I'm gonna cut

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:44.700 
the little round cutter I'm gonna cut
two<00:01:35.990> circles<00:01:40.030> like<00:01:41.030> so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.460 

now<00:01:45.580> obviously<00:01:45.790> they<00:01:46.120> don't<00:01:46.210> obey<00:01:46.480> flip-flop

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
now obviously they don't obey flip-flop

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.320 
now obviously they don't obey flip-flop
shaped<00:01:47.740> at<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:47.980> moment<00:01:48.310> what<00:01:48.940> I'm<00:01:49.030> gonna<00:01:49.120> do

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
shaped at the moment what I'm gonna do

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.760 
shaped at the moment what I'm gonna do
it<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.600> using<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.020> again<00:01:50.320> I'm<00:01:50.440> gonna<00:01:50.530> take

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
it was using this again I'm gonna take

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.640 
it was using this again I'm gonna take
out<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.980> small<00:01:51.990> section<00:01:52.990> on<00:01:53.610> each<00:01:54.610> one<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:56.380> so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
out a small section on each one like so

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.540 
out a small section on each one like so
and<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:57.160> we<00:01:57.250> don't<00:01:57.370> need<00:01:57.550> those<00:01:57.729> bits<00:01:58.000> there

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and then we don't need those bits there

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.890 
and then we don't need those bits there
and<00:02:00.550> then<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.850> I'm<00:02:00.940> gonna<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.479> just<00:02:01.660> push

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
and then what I'm gonna do is just push

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.310 
and then what I'm gonna do is just push
these<00:02:02.110> slightly<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.540> pushing<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.960> in<00:02:05.080> at

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
these slightly so I'm pushing it in at

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.719 
these slightly so I'm pushing it in at
this<00:02:05.560> side<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.010> get<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.220> kind<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.490> flat

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
this side so you get a kind of flat

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.449 
this side so you get a kind of flat
shape<00:02:07.030> there<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.619> removing<00:02:09.310> that

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
shape there and just removing that

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.190 
shape there and just removing that
little<00:02:09.700> Curt<00:02:09.940> all<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.539> point<00:02:10.810> there<00:02:11.050> I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
little Curt all that point there I'm

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.340 
little Curt all that point there I'm
curving<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.040> again<00:02:12.250> flattening<00:02:13.140> at<00:02:14.140> this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
curving it and again flattening at this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.520 
curving it and again flattening at this
side<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:16.320> okay

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
side like that okay

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010 
side like that okay
now<00:02:18.160> we're<00:02:18.760> gonna<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:18.970> cut<00:02:19.510> off<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.840> little

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
now we're gonna just cut off that little

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.920 
now we're gonna just cut off that little
bit<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> point<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:22.140> either<00:02:23.140> side<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.720> then

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
bit of a point on either side and then

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.540 
bit of a point on either side and then
we're<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.140> having<00:02:26.440> around<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.890> off<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.070> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
we're just having around that off just a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.449 
we're just having around that off just a
little<00:02:27.790> bit<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.650> means<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.130> using<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
little bit it just means if you using a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.699 
little bit it just means if you using a
round<00:02:30.640> cutter<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.239> molding<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.320> like<00:02:32.530> that

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
round cutter and molding it's like that

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.470 
round cutter and molding it's like that
you<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:32.950> need<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.160> buy<00:02:33.310> cutters<00:02:33.910> especially

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you don't need to buy cutters especially

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.660 
you don't need to buy cutters especially
for<00:02:34.750> your<00:02:35.350> flip-flops<00:02:37.050> okay<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:39.310> there<00:02:39.520> our

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
for your flip-flops okay it's there our

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.280 
for your flip-flops okay it's there our
basic<00:02:40.120> flip-flop<00:02:40.540> shape<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.050> they're<00:02:41.170> quite

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
basic flip-flop shape so they're quite

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.729 
basic flip-flop shape so they're quite
chunky<00:02:42.250> looking<00:02:42.760> ones<00:02:42.970> rather<00:02:43.239> than<00:02:43.739> find

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
chunky looking ones rather than find

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.580 
chunky looking ones rather than find
petite<00:02:45.160> ones<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:46.989> move<00:02:47.140> them<00:02:47.290> around<00:02:47.410> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
petite ones so just move them around a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.100 
petite ones so just move them around a
little<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:47.860> until<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.220> happy<00:02:48.930> with<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
little bit until you happy with the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.640 
little bit until you happy with the
shapes<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.769> I'm<00:02:51.610> happy<00:02:51.850> with<00:02:52.000> them<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.390> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
shapes so I'm happy with them like that

shapes so I'm happy with them like that
I'm<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.890> gonna<00:02:54.070> use<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.730> bottom<00:02:55.000> end<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.209> my

using your gum paste or your modeling
and<00:03:20.290> flour<00:03:20.470> paste<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:22.060> strap<00:03:22.330> bits<00:03:22.540> on

and flour paste and the strap bits on
the<00:03:22.750> foot<00:03:22.989> box<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> should<00:03:23.860> find<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.190> flop<00:03:24.459> to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
the foot box so I should find a flop to

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.660 
the foot box so I should find a flop to
easily<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.989> I've<00:03:26.049> dyed<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
color that one also died bands well it's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.050 
color that one also died bands well it's
a<00:03:32.290> bit<00:03:32.470> sticky<00:03:32.739> give<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.640> couple<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:33.940> minutes

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
a bit sticky give it a couple of minutes

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.720 
a bit sticky give it a couple of minutes
to<00:03:34.360> stop<00:03:34.540> rest<00:03:34.840> before<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.350> use<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.620> I'm<00:03:36.549> gonna

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
to stop rest before you use it I'm gonna

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.190 
to stop rest before you use it I'm gonna
roll<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.000> out<00:03:37.209> but<00:03:37.510> not<00:03:37.630> too<00:03:37.690> thin<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:41.079> then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
roll it out but not too thin and then

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.870 
roll it out but not too thin and then
we're<00:03:41.290> gonna<00:03:41.380> try<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.829> cut<00:03:42.040> some<00:03:42.310> quite<00:03:42.549> thin

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
we're gonna try and cut some quite thin

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.250 
we're gonna try and cut some quite thin
strips

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.550 

that's<00:03:47.260> what

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
should be able to cut each of these in

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.280 
should be able to cut each of these in
half<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.749> use<00:03:53.780> roughly<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:56.900> what<00:03:57.200> I'm

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
half to use roughly and then what I'm

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.449 
half to use roughly and then what I'm
gonna<00:03:57.379> do<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:58.370> just<00:03:58.609> push<00:03:58.790> them<00:03:58.999> together<00:04:00.459> like

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
gonna do is just push them together like

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.420 
gonna do is just push them together like
that<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.799> I'm<00:04:03.799> gonna<00:04:03.920> bring<00:04:04.099> them<00:04:04.249> to<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
that and I'm gonna bring them to a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.190 
that and I'm gonna bring them to a
better<00:04:04.609> point<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.299> point<00:04:05.359> will<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:05.930> go

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
better point to that point will then go

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.500 
better point to that point will then go
into<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.859> hole<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.099> I've<00:04:07.370> made<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:08.329> just

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
into the hole that I've made so just
