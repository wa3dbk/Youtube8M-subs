00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.260
 what to wear red buffet for you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 I chose again such principles with which I 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.529
 go well red ballet flats i will 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 show on your loved ones today 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.570
 ballet shoes but in general it works on any 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 except for the red visa perhaps boots 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 and so the first thing you guess right 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.480
 red all about raspberry style 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 that is, marine style and everything about 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.820
 stripes strip stack stripes in skirts 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 strip on bags strip you strip 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 here is red shoes by itself 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 very good red more than 30 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.260
 talk to be easier very well 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.750
 underline the stripes the second principle is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.969
 cage cage scottish cage 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 french cage small cage like 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.800
 goose is far kana cage is not large 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 it matters the main thing that it is large 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 cell fit you but in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 whole 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.549
 cell like strip very likes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 red shoes, be sure to try 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:26.340
 and I think you will be very surprised how 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 The following principle looks cool 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 which you surely guess the speed 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.380
 footwear is total total clothing 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.970
 white that is, we are all white 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 white blouse white skirt white shorts 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.960
 example or total black 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 it could be all black or you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.540
 just a black little dress which 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.230
 want to do not in the evening version and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 possibly 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.370
 me casual option or worker 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 any business style is also 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.960
 permissible when you're alone 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.940
 color feature is neutral colors 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 black white gray red shoes 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.200
 Ideally, this is such a cherry on 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.540
 cake is the one highlight that is needed to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.520
 dilute 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.410
 basic basic things if you didn't watch 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.820
 another video about what to wear base 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.740
 Dresses I recommend this video 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.750
 necessarily because it shows 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.220
 principles of what basic things are 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 such basic pay such basic 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.070
 colors follow principle with what to wear 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.620
 red shoes are antagonist colors what 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.450
 is red in color circle 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 opposite red stands green only 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.070
 itself green neutral yes all that 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 concerns the green spectrum it may be 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.550
 aqua it could be light 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.220
 mint it could be a light like that 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.350
 young green whichever you 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.750
 choose your green which you 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.250
 does not fit the color type 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.840
 just because he is green green 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.270
 maybe cold green maybe 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
 warm shower remember the ban if you have 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.240
 the street will be your right green then 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.440
 red shoes will emphasize each other 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.630
 the following is very good red 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.330
 this is jeans it can be classic 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.810
 blue jeans it could be jeans with 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.390
 it can be holes but if 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.209
 you have up to distract the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.060
 attention to yours let's say that then 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.680
 everything from here including accessories and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.680
 makeup should not be bright 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.270
 I hope today's lesson was useful to you 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.870
 like if write like this 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.010
 please with what do you combine red and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.990
 we will communicate will share 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.570
 impressions will help each other 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.550
 form an impression of yourself on 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.960
