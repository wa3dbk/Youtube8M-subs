 now you run with us by the way 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 east of são paulo rodoanel 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
 the work that connects the southern stretch to the stretch 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 north of its final stretch 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.610
 are about 40 kilometers that should 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.190
 relieve and much the life of the walk 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.369
 the gustavo lima reporter was to check the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.369
 works 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 the eastern section of the tiller comprises 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 six cities in the surroundings of são paulo 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.470
 Arujá itaquaquecetuba mauá to the stream 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.530
 saucer and suzano brazil truck driver 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
 visited the work in 2013 beginning what 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.329
 it was bar and concrete everywhere 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 begins to make way for bridge viaducts 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.809
 in some stretches to tracks with tracks 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.809
 signaling 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 the investment of the work about 3.2 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.210
 billions of reais have private capital 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.000
 a novelty in the country when the subject is 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.800
 road construction 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.710
 the concern for the environment also 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.539
 was taken into account for works or 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 two technologies to avoid 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.740
 degradation of the tiête and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 guava 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 this equipment is prior sing the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.820
 of the bridge were 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.189
 placed aerially without the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.899
 need for access to the house 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.619
 is placed plus the equipment 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:26.700
 manages to continue the result 22 thousand 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 tons of steel 183 thousand cubic meters 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.350
 concrete and eight kilometers of track 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.049
 with little degradation other equipment 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.119
 that we are also using the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.549
 is an equipment that is a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.920
 mobile symbol and nothing else is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 that a form that is a mobile form only 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.159
 which is of great extent he has 60 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.380
 meters so that each concrete 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.470
 section of viaduct not being two 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.860
 equipment on one track and another 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 the other then the actual people there about 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740
 of 60 meters between the execution of this 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 concretely in a short period the period 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 of seven-day cycle and is 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 completing 60 meters of bridge and the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690
 viaduct 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.070
 the tunnel drive santa luzia 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.820
 still intense 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.519
 2003, here are the off-road 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.250
 now the region is dominated by tractors and 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.440
 dump trucks the big stones 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 who were around here no longer 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.970
 there are from here the region of the holy tunnel 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.190
 shone were taken two million 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.010
 cubic meters of gravel all the material 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.780
 was used to build the highway now 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.380
 the passage goes through the process of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.380
 landscaping 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.220
 total will be 220 thousand tons of 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.079
 asphalt about 500 times more than the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.590
 total used in the construction of the racetrack 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.590
 of interlagos 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.670
 Michael is one of the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.159
 participate in work for more than a year in 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.030
 played took the change that face of the 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.760
 highway 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.000
 satisfaction at first you look 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.489
 so chat here was all the land right 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.159
 now see the asphalt all ready, huh? 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.709
 sic but then I already read here and here I 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.650
 already law when it was land 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.480
 the course is shorter but the work 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.389
 It's not easy 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.280
 heavy vehicles travel to and from the 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.530
 the truckers ricardo and sérgio 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.569
 whoever plays these machines agrees 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.519
 needs to pay close attention 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.099
 walks a lot because the driver has to 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.150
 be quite cautious 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.889
 carelessness is death, right, it 's a canyon 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.040
 hillside 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.620
 are several obstacles neves signed the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.810
 ball as you see it does not have guard kings 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.819
 still is not yet in the process of 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.620
 finish still requires quite a lot 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.989
 driver's caution there is a 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.060
 difference great driver on the road and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.400
 here inside the road I have enough 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.220
 time but only that it is very different 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.790
 working on the stretch of the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.349
 shorter stretch here is is more difficult 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.480
 that's the way people talk about us every day 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.229
 because in the star it is quieter than that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.120
 who is more run a little more but 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.989
 rush happens only during the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.459
 office hour 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.889
 the chosen truck drivers to 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.409
 work on the eastern section of the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.570
 They live in the area for robson the highway 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.669
 can leverage the economy of the cities of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.080
 around São Paulo, our city is 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.690
 a dormitory city, right? 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.970
 unfortunately not every citizen of suzano 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.250
 lives and works here in suzano eu 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.080
 I believe that with this work we can 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.300
 bring more companies here and power 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.650
 to make the people of suzano work 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.960
 and lives here born in the region like me 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.240
 manoel is another example changed life 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520
 in the stretch for construction 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.210
 the trucker the best building is in 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 House 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.500
 the most remarkable that I work a lot 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.870
 close to home I have more time to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.790
 to meet the cast she arrives is one thing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.490
 that the truck method he can note 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.990
 Everyone's already been there and I'm coming. 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.560
 and playing around with them 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.560
 a time 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.920
 the eastern section of the squeegee must be 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.010
 ready in june 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.320
 the expectation is that 50 thousand vehicles 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.690
 move through the highway daily 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.720
 will work as in the other three 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.390
 the driver pays off the road 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.090
 price is yet to be set 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:30.090
 our traffic around 60 65% is already 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.770
 the truck is a 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.500
 frequent customer of ours and in the east 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.100
 this should remain mainly 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.780
 a connection is important that will be the 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.330
 connection is doerr international port 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.120
 São Paulo with the port of Santos then the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.500
 people believe that we are going to continue 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.530
 with the same characteristics and vehicles 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.210
 of the southern section will be reflected in the 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.090
 also a large majority of 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.240
 trucks 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.210
 for who was part of the work to travel with 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.290
 family by the east ring road will bring many 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.750
 memories 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.949
 the first thing I'll do whatever I have 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.830
 inaugural beltway here I sin and 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.570
 lake there at the beginning I'll go to the end of 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.460
 path with them to show them that 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.740
 I was part of this too, I have a photo here. 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.650
 years later and it 's cool we have these 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.570
 will not show you how it was 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.470
 before and as you after I pass 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.780
 by the stretch 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.020
 we look and see that we really 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.389
 part of a finger of the progress of the 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.710
 development and will be legal when 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.080
 Are you ready to go? 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.639
 remember the parts that people 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.240
 worked and the service we did 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.020
 here at gustavo lima for brazil 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.020
 truck driver
