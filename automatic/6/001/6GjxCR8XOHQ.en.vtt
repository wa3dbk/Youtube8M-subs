00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 This is how our chicken coop looks like. 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.259
 built this year 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.559
 watched a lot of videos like 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.059
 connected more optimally for us and here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.619
 our works and so its height is 2 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.590
 meter 7 centimeters length meter 60 is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.880
 without socket plus socket width 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.679
 50 it turns 210 like its length 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 together with the nest and here under the nest still 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.430
 there is a little meter enclosure 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 forty 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.620
 and he has two floors with a height of 1 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 the floor we got 70 centimeters and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.640
 the rest is all on the first floor 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 the floor we wanted to accommodate 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.539
 broilers are therefore made small 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.760
 Aviary that I do not need a lot of space and 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.729
 done in the aviary 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.280
 the floors then and now show closer the second 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
 we would like to adjust the floor for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 laying hens 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.450
 and we get here such a ladder with 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 first floor on the first at first i'm very 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.540
 worried think how they will go 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.409
 and we do not really like it but it turned out 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 that they really liked and in the morning when I 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.770
 let them out they have even the opportunity 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.590
 fly than they like to use here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:45.259
 such we have aviary he certainly not very 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 big but we keep 9 chickens and a cock 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 that's why we thought so to them 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 enough for the second floor 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 we made three perches basically sit 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.530
 Of course chickens on the top perches I have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 there is a white crust and brown so here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.110
 whites sit with our white cock on 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.760
 brown sit separately and here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 here are their nests and when i stand the testicles i 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.739
 I did not climb the house but I will show you now how I am 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.739
 I get them a parcel of used sawdust but 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 we have them big and we put in the nest 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 dried grass 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.700
 our chicken coop is not warmed 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 only the roof is insulated 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.880
 because we did it for the summer 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160
 of use 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.390
 but now it's August and we think about 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.450
 the fact that all these leave for the winter and 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.410
 we will warm so only I do not know 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 will there be enough space here well 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 I guess I think that's enough 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.410
 here on the latch is closed and on the first 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.410
 floor 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.770
 so here looks first floor thinking 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.950
 to have taken the ditch but did not have time to buy them 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.860
 and one of our chicken is sick, we even had a 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.800
 and that she will die, but she stayed 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.900
 alive and the rest at 6 began to offend her 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.000
 so here she lives here on the ground 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.640
 the floor we adapted from plastic 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.050
 box nest but she does not rush in it 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.180
 wherever it lays its testicles so 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:54.360
 Looks like it’s 70 high 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:07.040
 centimeters from the 1st floor goes to us 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:07.040
 the lower aviary it is 80 centimeters wide 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:18.209
 the bottom flap is opened by raising the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.709
 there is no need for me to go in and out 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.109
 rope removed 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.109
 and screw 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:37.550
 putting on a loop now I'll show you right away 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 nest and so court here looks like this and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:52.130
 for the aviary on top of the ride and cover us 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:05:01.370
 rises and do not need to go in 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:02.360
 inside to pick up the testicle set in 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.440
 Aviary Pinyug 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.430
 I really don't like our Peter Ivanovich 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.530
 he watches his girls 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.010
 at first he certainly did not understand but then 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.520
 he really liked the books on the second floor 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:25.460
 the door also opens outside but it 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:31.340
 does not rise and goes that is like this 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:37.180
 so I ’m waiting for her and hang up on a carnation 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.180
 loop here it is open to us 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:58.469
 the length of the enclosure is about three meters well 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:02.349
 certainly not very well, nothing about the direction of 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:09.039
 our here we live 8 chicken 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:10.869
 the cockerel there are 9 things, but I think that 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.039
 if 10 lived here 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:18.819
 then they would have enough space for fencing 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.860
 The cages used a netting net and a 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.490
 the roof was simply covered 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.099
 cellophane was initially fenced but 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.189
 it turned out that she was smallish and brown and 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.219
 sometimes they flew out so they sewed 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.990
 wooden slats 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.009
 At first they thought that we would make a roof out of 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.129
 polycarbonate 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:43.659
 but then they decided that bye 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:48.610
 will come and so and then we will see 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:55.860
 made such a frame and imposed on him 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:59.399
 film under the aviary attached to the house 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:04.899
 At first, of course, they wanted to do further 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:05.559
 door but then in order to simplify the work 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.749
 to myself 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:11.529
 attached still to the house did not 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:13.599
 In the middle but inconvenient the fact that we are 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.740
 made for crusts here and a ladder 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:20.830
 interferes when I start cleaning up the aviary 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:24.610
 Well everything is perfect everything 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.039
 comes with experience therefore I share my 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.099
 experience for you if there are any 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:33.449
 questions contact everyone thank you for 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.449
 attention goodbye
