lemons four lemons has yielded

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.220 
lemons four lemons has yielded
approximately<00:02:06.960> 1/3<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.200> cup<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:10.600> will

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
approximately 1/3 of a cup and it will

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.500 
approximately 1/3 of a cup and it will
dehydrate<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.490> bit<00:02:12.730> smaller<00:02:13.120> as<00:02:13.390> well<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:15.610> to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
dehydrate a bit smaller as well on to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.130 
dehydrate a bit smaller as well on to
step<00:02:16.840> number<00:02:17.140> two<00:02:17.820> dehydrate<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:19.360> we<00:02:19.900> have

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
step number two dehydrate so we have

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.080 
step number two dehydrate so we have
here<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:22.170> dehydrated

have a whole lot to it but if you every
time<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.640> use<00:03:39.640> some<00:03:39.910> lemons<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.250> zest

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
time you use some lemons get the zest

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.110 
time you use some lemons get the zest
you<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.239> constantly<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.730> making<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:45.850> stuff

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you can constantly be making this stuff

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.900 
you can constantly be making this stuff
although<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.049> not<00:03:47.320> something<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.860> I<00:03:48.220> use

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
although it's not something that I use

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.350 
although it's not something that I use
too<00:03:49.180> often<00:03:49.660> if<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.760> ever<00:03:51.910> want<00:03:52.239> that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
too often if if you ever want that

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.460 
too often if if you ever want that
flavor<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:53.530> nice<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.830> happen<00:03:54.069> on

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
flavor it's nice to happen on

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.750

again<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.550> can<00:03:55.760> use<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.540> with<00:03:57.370> other<00:03:58.370> citrus

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
again you can use this with other citrus

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.030 
again you can use this with other citrus
like<00:03:59.120> oranges<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.900> you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.530> add<00:04:00.710> other

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
whatnot so lots of room for

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.880 
whatnot so lots of room for
experimentation<00:04:07.550> with<00:04:08.510> flavors<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.410> add<00:04:09.590> to

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
this up it's already quite fine looks

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.640 
this up it's already quite fine looks
kind<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.690> like<00:04:22.810> shredded<00:04:23.810> shredded<00:04:24.260> wheat

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
that cereal it's pretty crumbly you

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.590 
that cereal it's pretty crumbly you
could<00:04:29.960> also<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.940> mortar<00:04:32.390> and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
could also do this in a mortar and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.740 
could also do this in a mortar and
pestle<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.350> just<00:04:33.650> grind<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.790> up<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.660> I'm

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
pestle and just grind it up but I'm

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.630 
pestle and just grind it up but I'm
going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> use<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.110> Vitamix<00:04:36.530> here<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.550> we're

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
going to use the Vitamix here so we're

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.590 
going to use the Vitamix here so we're
just<00:04:37.790> going<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.940> pour<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.540> there<00:04:38.980> and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
just going to pour that in there and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.730

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.670 
what I like to do is just take this and
put<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:46.190> on<00:04:46.390> in<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.450> reverse<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.500> way

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
put it on in the reverse in that way

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.810 
put it on in the reverse in that way
you're<00:04:48.890> not<00:04:48.950> going<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.280> get<00:04:49.370> all<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.640> dust
