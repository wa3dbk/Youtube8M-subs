00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
doesn't feel flimsy to even really get a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.800

here and the handle part is a nice
rubber<00:02:04.250> material<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.850> does<00:02:06.030> help<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.299> keep

another thing I like is this little

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.790 
another thing I like is this little
doohickey<00:02:12.490> right<00:02:12.820> here<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.420> used<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.960> hold

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
doohickey right here this used to hold

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220 
doohickey right here this used to hold
the<00:02:15.190> iron<00:02:15.370> up<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.270> doesn't<00:02:16.570> touch<00:02:16.780> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the iron up so that it doesn't touch and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.710 
the iron up so that it doesn't touch and
burn<00:02:17.920> whatever<00:02:18.310> surface<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:19.030> using<00:02:19.270> to

your<00:02:48.160> hair<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.210> thought<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.660> was<00:02:49.780> pretty

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560

your hair and I thought that was pretty
neat<00:02:50.800> too<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.070> started<00:02:51.790> at<00:02:51.970> 7<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> was<00:02:53.320> doing

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
neat too I started at 7 but I was doing

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.640 
neat too I started at 7 but I was doing
pretty<00:02:53.920> big<00:02:54.280> chunks<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.270> my<00:02:55.390> hair<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.110> moved

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
pretty big chunks of my hair so I moved

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.890 
pretty big chunks of my hair so I moved
it<00:02:56.770> all<00:02:57.040> imma<00:02:57.760> did<00:02:57.910> all<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> way<00:02:58.210> up<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.420> 10<00:02:58.660> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it all imma did all the way up to 10 and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.120 
it all imma did all the way up to 10 and
it<00:03:00.060> works<00:03:01.060> really<00:03:01.330> really<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:02.740> actually

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
it works really really well actually

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.950 
it works really really well actually
when<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.520> first<00:03:03.730> turned<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.480> warm<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> up

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
when I first turned it on to warm it up

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.900 
when I first turned it on to warm it up
I<00:03:05.230> had<00:03:05.650> only<00:03:05.830> had<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.490> on<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.850> couple

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
I had only had it on for a couple

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.910 
I had only had it on for a couple
seconds<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.720> was<00:03:07.840> sectioning<00:03:08.320> off<00:03:08.410> my<00:03:08.650> hair

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
seconds and I was sectioning off my hair

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
seconds and I was sectioning off my hair
and<00:03:09.280> there<00:03:09.790> was<00:03:09.910> steam<00:03:10.180> coming<00:03:10.570> from<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:10.990> it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
and there was steam coming from it so it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.930 
and there was steam coming from it so it
does<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:11.470> very<00:03:11.500> hot<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.400> one<00:03:12.550> seven

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
does get very hot and that was one seven

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.710 
does get very hot and that was one seven
so<00:03:13.180> if<00:03:13.570> you're<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:13.930> sure<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.970> setting<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.570> do

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
so if you're not sure what setting to do

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.270 
so if you're not sure what setting to do
don't<00:03:17.290> start<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.620> off<00:03:17.709> at<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.890> highest<00:03:18.070> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
don't start it off at the highest I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280 
don't start it off at the highest I
would<00:03:18.400> say<00:03:18.610> started<00:03:19.120> off<00:03:19.270> at<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.630> lower<00:03:19.930> setting

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
would say started off at a lower setting

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.080 
would say started off at a lower setting
and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:21.010> work<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.310> way<00:03:21.370> up<00:03:21.459> if<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.940> not

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
and then work your way up if it's not

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.060 
and then work your way up if it's not
getting<00:03:22.240> hot<00:03:22.480> enough<00:03:22.540> for<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.500> only<00:03:23.800> con

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
getting hot enough for you the only con

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.360 
getting hot enough for you the only con
I<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.490> say<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:26.650> ceramic

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
I can say is that this is not ceramic

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.670 
I can say is that this is not ceramic
and<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:28.180> know<00:03:28.240> that<00:03:28.600> ceramic<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.320> best<00:03:29.500> for

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
and I know that ceramic is the best for

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.550 
and I know that ceramic is the best for
your<00:03:29.770> hair<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.840> not<00:03:31.959> ceramic<00:03:32.440> I

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
your hair but this is not ceramic I

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.360 
your hair but this is not ceramic I
believe<00:03:32.800> they<00:03:33.010> said<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.280> was<00:03:33.370> gold-plated<00:03:34.200> so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
believe they said it was gold-plated so

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.120 
believe they said it was gold-plated so
you<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:37.510> kind<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.690> cool<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.170> not<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
you know it's kind of cool but not the

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.280 
you know it's kind of cool but not the
best<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:39.489> your<00:03:39.580> hair<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:40.330> shopping<00:03:41.050> around

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
best for your hair I was shopping around

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.470 
best for your hair I was shopping around
before<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:42.040> bought<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.760> was<00:03:43.120> thinking

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
before I bought this I was thinking

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.270 
before I bought this I was thinking
about<00:03:43.570> getting<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.989> QI<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.739> heard<00:03:45.100> that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
