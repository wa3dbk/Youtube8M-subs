00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.990
 today for one all my videos 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.540
 guys this will be a video again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.069
 player predictions for 8 16 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 with five new players like 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 usually I believe a little risk of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
 you release the video the very next day where 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.480
 I wanted to release another video as 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.830
 this here so it's not you can 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.180
 always go see her it's not 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 the weather ben here you see and see the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.789
 two directly like that and with in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.680
 more neymar and chance like you to see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 two very good players who will be 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400
 continues French and if you want 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.070
 you credit in passing do not hesitate to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.390
 pass on fifa.com links and in the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 description there was really a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 good price drop so do not hesitate 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 to failure and -2 5% with razak code 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 always somewhere else started with the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 first player who will be Bordeaux and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.570
 the Uruguayan diego forlan 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 so that was right middle of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 base I think the year 72 kart 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 after I can not tell you if will 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 rare not look in any case it will have neither 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 because for me this moment at 76.2 general 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 always with four stars 2g 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.420
 three-star technique of my craft and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 here it will take almost everywhere a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 little more anyway I think in speed 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 because it's really faster than 78 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.890
 I think he had where are these 19 I do not 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.909
 know more they will have faster and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 frankly this step includes little 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.850
 near all everywhere we will have the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.040
 Belgian 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 the player voted best player of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 first league the chelsea player well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 sure eden hazard but very nice goals at 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.650
 passage against the barca a friendly match 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 so he'll have a big one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.830
 increase but especially in any case 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 for me he deserves to have the five 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 technical gesture stars for me in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.280
 any case 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 a player like that deserves them 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 not want to agree says that me in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.829
 the comments and for me theirs and 89 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 of general there are some who say 90 but 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.280
 that's for me I think it's missing a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 little bit about everything especially in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.899
 league champions to have 90 m 2 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 general we will have neymar now the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.549
 Brazilian player from Barça including two 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 consecutive players so not him it's 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.520
 always five stars considered cynical and 5 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.920
 bad-footed stars it 's not going 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.530
 change and he will also take him I think 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 89 years has no general just like eden 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.930
 hazard i think because that's really 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.500
 a huge season 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.270
 on his part as possible from the barça everything 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.480
 it will just take just about every 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 everywhere pretty much everywhere especially 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.770
 draws I think it really will be 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.190
 caraman very very beautiful there we will have 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.860
 karim bellarabi the german player of 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.420
 bayer leverkusen which will have 4 stars 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.220
 management and 3 stars of my feet 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.410
 always in my opinion I think it's going 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.860
 will not move it will take just about every 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.590
 by all except at 20 speed I 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.930
 did not believe not increased in speed and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 maybe more a pretty good game and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 frankly really see beautiful 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.800
 cards be 119 of our of general it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 had already had a Greek note 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.090
 I think here it will stop at 79 that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.730
 will not really be very very good and for 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.860
 finish the jenny jérémy ménez french 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 the ac Milan player that I put in 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.980
 82.2 general gesture she will put 80 or 90 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.480
 2 but well I said to myself when 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.890
 even put it to 82 because they are 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.300
 really a very, very, very good 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.700
 season on the side of mine is then it's 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.650
 one of the few good players on the side of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.330
 milan after I do not know this season 6 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.230
 will play NATO what are the choices 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.840
 of the coach 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.459
 for sure he will not be so good 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.600
 statistical level that has been on the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.040
 previous season but in any case where 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.030
 aroma a very nice card from him 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.530
 always with four stars I know who 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 is bad badly frankly a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.860
 downright very very beautiful here are the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.720
 pledges that these five new 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.459
 players will want to please if you 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.570
