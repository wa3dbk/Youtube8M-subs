00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:11.530
 the first of July 2006 started 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.630
 six months in advance his service 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.480
 the train to the ASA train that if you want 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.110
 can also take Beijing in Shanghai 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 putting days and days for now but 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.140
 which in essence is taken either with pumpkin 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.690
 of italy gas or at the station 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.010
 next important that the seeding the 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.579
 capital of qinghai 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 then with 25 hours of travel yes 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.320
 arrives in lhasa is an absolutely train 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.380
 extraordinary and travels at heights for 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.980
 almost all his time exceeding the 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.899
 the taboo passes to 5,200 and I don't know how many 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.290
 meters traveling for hundreds of 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:01.390
 kilometers on the permafrost or on 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.960
 permanent ice that I pass by 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 amount of galleries the shows that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.370
 you see they are absolutely 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.550
 extraordinary both outside and inside 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.790
 the travelers themselves but not many 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.340
 travelers but the equipment 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:27.640
 train equipment that include 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 even for each seat a dispenser 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.110
 of oxygen because at those altitudes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 I repeat over someone's 5000 meters 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.170
 may also have some problems 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.420
 the journey should risk at times 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.200
 to become monotonous if it were not for 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.819
 this continuous change from the landscape 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.659
 from real salt lakes to snow 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.909
 ai joined the consolidation work 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:08.319
 of the throat of the ground for the road 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:15.280
 ferrata but especially to the paninari 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.799
 this is a land a natural park the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.739
 Hunting is prohibited so you are seen 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.230
 still many antelopes in freedom but 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:32.049
 especially the show and with by 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:36.190
 grazing animals away the sheep le 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.680
 famous Tibetan goats with their 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.650
 precious wool that the helmet the most 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.159
 delicate and light there is 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.379
 and horses until exceeded the tango 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.459
 pasta 5,200 meters 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.099
 the descent begins and the panorama is made 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.840
 increasingly green because we are 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.840
 on the southern slope 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:07.359
 therefore with climatic conditions for 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:14.790
 build better and some point yes 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:14.790
 go beyond the magnificent lake lanzo pegli 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.110
 no 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.470
 after 25 hours more or less if it arrives in lanza 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.200
 and the station show like 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:08.240
 you can see is absolute and extraordinary 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.210
 I do not know what it conveys arrive 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.180
 they leave every day from this station 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.120
 but certainly everywhere that villari 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.470
 of marbles would come out several several 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.470
 stations that European
