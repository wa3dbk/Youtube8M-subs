was like oh gosh I haven't made that in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.359 
was like oh gosh I haven't made that in
so<00:01:58.590> long

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so long

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
so long
is<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:00.360> any<00:02:01.110> danger<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> burning<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
is there any danger of burning the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.770 
is there any danger of burning the
chocolate<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.030> I'll<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.240> keep<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.630> on

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
chocolate on here I'll just keep it on

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
chocolate on here I'll just keep it on
low<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:04.409> gonna<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.189> patient<00:02:05.850> your

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
low you're gonna have to be patient your

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
low you're gonna have to be patient your
chocolates<00:02:06.689> gonna<00:02:06.840> melt<00:02:07.140> pretty<00:02:07.320> quickly<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
chocolates gonna melt pretty quickly and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.320 
chocolates gonna melt pretty quickly and
then<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> marshmallows<00:02:08.729> are<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.030> gonna

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
then the marshmallows are just gonna

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.960 
then the marshmallows are just gonna
slowly<00:02:09.750> break<00:02:10.200> down

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
slowly break down

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.870 
slowly break down
and<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.380> takes<00:02:12.650> probably<00:02:13.100> about<00:02:13.430> seven

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and so it takes probably about seven

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.320 
and so it takes probably about seven
minutes

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
minutes

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.690 
minutes

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
hmm and so I've already got one finish

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.910 
hmm and so I've already got one finish
but<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.300> show<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.710> how<00:02:18.710> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
get so smelly but it does and this is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.860 
get so smelly but it does and this is
what<00:02:43.340> we're<00:02:43.460> looking<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.060> made<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.600> one<00:02:44.810> a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
what we're looking for I made this one a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.170 
what we're looking for I made this one a
little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.230> earlier<00:02:45.770> okay<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.460> very<00:02:46.670> smooth

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
little bit earlier okay it's very smooth

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.810 
little bit earlier okay it's very smooth
and<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.020> almost<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> foam<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.760> I'm

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and this it's almost like a foam so I'm

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.670 
and this it's almost like a foam so I'm
going<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.000> tell<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.330> light<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.990> airy

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
going to tell it's light and airy

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.440 
going to tell it's light and airy
because<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.340> does<00:02:52.490> have<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.760> marshmallow<00:02:53.210> in

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
because it does have that marshmallow in

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.000 
because it does have that marshmallow in
it<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.900> gets<00:02:53.990> that<00:02:54.260> chocolate<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.830> little

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it so it gets that chocolate a little

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.330 
it so it gets that chocolate a little
more<00:02:55.160> air<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> that's<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
more air in it that's just this one and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.770 
more air in it that's just this one and
we're<00:02:58.430> gonna<00:02:58.520> take<00:02:58.790> our<00:02:59.030> first<00:02:59.060> eight<00:02:59.600> ounce

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
