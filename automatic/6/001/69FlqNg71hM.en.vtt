00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.559
 there are very good we are all in the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 zombies of black ops 2 on the transit map 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.680
 and we're going to see a trick that consists of 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.140
 how to revive a partner faster 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.930
 what should we do we will have to relive 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.240
 the fallen partner several times until 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.760
 that when we relive it, it comes out as an aura 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.239
 a green light that you will see more 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.980
 go ahead and this will tell us that 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.760
 we have activated the ability to revive 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.790
 fast anime came out by reliving it 15 times 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.780
 but this amount may vary 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.220
 be 13 14 17 depends there is not a figure 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 exact 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.060
 for this I have moved to fast camera for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.590
 make it a little more enjoyable 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.810
 if it would not be a heavy 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.630
 and if we keep reviving until not 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.129
 come to light and apart the letters of 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.280
 reviving us will change color 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.280
 indicating that we already have the ability 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 activated 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.130
 Now it is short is in the following 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.719
 look good 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.719
 now when I relive it 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.100
 here you see you have seen that green light 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 Well, that only tells us that we already have 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.020
 life from living fast a companion 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.950
 the letters of reanimando take a color 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 purple and as you can see his revive 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.750
 Too much faster 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 and other than that it takes out an extra little money 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.250
 he always comes good 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.650
 we are also in round 2 and we have not 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.479
 left here with what the current 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.340
 our active but if we put the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.710
 fan next to the machine we can 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.960
 buy the advantage of reviving us but 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.400
 this also makes you relive a little 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.120
 faster 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.800
 but I really did not see much difference 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.340
 but I've seen out there that they comment and 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.640
 and we wanted to try it and here I leave you 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 the video 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.400
 nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.650

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.180
 we could go through a hospital
