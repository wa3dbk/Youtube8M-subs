all the thermostat checks and you check

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.949 
all the thermostat checks and you check
the<00:00:12.759> heater<00:00:12.969> and<00:00:13.059> everything<00:00:13.480> like<00:00:13.629> that<00:00:13.690> and

you<00:00:14.019> still<00:00:14.230> have<00:00:14.349> a<00:00:14.379> dryer<00:00:14.679> that's<00:00:14.919> not

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
you still have a dryer that's not

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.189 
you still have a dryer that's not
heating<00:00:15.610> I<00:00:15.789> want<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:16.840> show<00:00:16.960> you<00:00:17.020> one<00:00:17.170> more

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
heating I want to show you one more

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.130 
heating I want to show you one more
thing<00:00:17.350> that<00:00:17.890> you<00:00:18.130> can<00:00:18.280> check<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.940> see<00:00:19.870> if<00:00:20.110> that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
thing that you can check to see if that

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.770 
thing that you can check to see if that
might<00:00:20.380> be<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.590> problem<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:22.240> right<00:00:22.420> so<00:00:22.600> if<00:00:22.720> you

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
might be the problem all right so if you

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.230 
might be the problem all right so if you
have<00:00:22.960> a<00:00:22.990> dryer<00:00:23.590> that's<00:00:24.460> not<00:00:24.670> heating<00:00:25.030> and<00:00:25.150> your

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
have a dryer that's not heating and your

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.990 
have a dryer that's not heating and your
heaters<00:00:25.510> good<00:00:25.720> your<00:00:25.900> thermostats<00:00:26.380> are<00:00:26.530> good

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
heaters good your thermostats are good

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.950 
heaters good your thermostats are good
the<00:00:28.000> next<00:00:28.270> thing<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:28.450> want<00:00:28.600> to<00:00:28.630> check<00:00:28.840> is

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
the next thing you want to check is

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.600 
the next thing you want to check is
going<00:00:29.080> to<00:00:29.140> be<00:00:29.260> the<00:00:29.350> switch<00:00:29.650> on<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:29.980> motor

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
going to be the switch on the motor

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.810 
going to be the switch on the motor
now<00:00:31.330> real<00:00:31.570> quick<00:00:32.190> there's<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.280> centrifugal

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
now real quick there's a centrifugal

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.430 
now real quick there's a centrifugal
switch<00:00:34.060> inside<00:00:34.540> here<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.930> when<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.200> motor

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
switch inside here that when this motor

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.190 
switch inside here that when this motor
starts<00:00:35.829> spinning<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:37.420> little<00:00:37.690> black<00:00:37.870> disc

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
starts spinning this little black disc

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.090 
starts spinning this little black disc
will<00:00:39.160> go<00:00:39.340> back<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> bottom<00:00:41.950> of<00:00:42.040> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
will go back and on the bottom of the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.510 
will go back and on the bottom of the
switch<00:00:43.290> there's<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.380> little<00:00:44.620> arm<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:48.370> that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
switch there's a little arm see that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.120 
switch there's a little arm see that
little<00:00:48.730> lever<00:00:48.850> right<00:00:49.030> there<00:00:49.090> moving<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.920> what

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
little lever right there moving so what

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.549 
little lever right there moving so what
happens<00:00:51.520> is<00:00:51.700> right<00:00:51.940> here<00:00:52.270> there's<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.050> contact

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
happens is right here there's a contact

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.280 
happens is right here there's a contact
for<00:00:53.770> your<00:00:53.829> heater<00:00:54.510> where<00:00:55.510> my<00:00:55.630> alligator<00:00:56.020> clip

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
for your heater where my alligator clip

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.690 
for your heater where my alligator clip
is<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.910> passes<00:00:58.540> through<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.399> up<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.550> where<00:01:00.670> my

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
is it passes through and up to where my

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.660 
is it passes through and up to where my
alligator<00:01:01.210> clip<00:01:01.480> is<00:01:01.600> nut<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.890> breaks<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
alligator clip is nut that breaks the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.880 
alligator clip is nut that breaks the
circuit<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.180> heater<00:01:04.560> when<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.620> motors

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
circuit to the heater when the motors

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.350 
circuit to the heater when the motors
not<00:01:06.010> running<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.700> when<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.909> motor<00:01:07.030> starts

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
not running so when the motor starts

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.390 
not running so when the motor starts
spinning<00:01:09.870> they<00:01:10.870> make<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> contact<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.890> allows

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
spinning they make a contact and allows

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.550 
spinning they make a contact and allows
the<00:01:12.580> heater<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.880> heat<00:01:12.909> up<00:01:13.030> these<00:01:13.990> switches<00:01:14.380> do

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the heater to heat up these switches do

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.910 
the heater to heat up these switches do
go<00:01:14.740> bad<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.420> little<00:01:16.600> arm<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.650> above

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
go bad or the little arm this it's above

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.370 
go bad or the little arm this it's above
that<00:01:17.950> black<00:01:18.479> disc<00:01:19.479> right<00:01:19.720> there<00:01:19.990> can

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
that black disc right there can

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.170 
that black disc right there can
sometimes<00:01:20.770> break<00:01:21.040> off<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:21.970> want<00:01:22.119> to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
sometimes break off so you want to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.359 
sometimes break off so you want to
unplug<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.540> dryer<00:01:22.780> take<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.860> cover<00:01:24.100> off<00:01:24.220> and

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
unplug the dryer take this cover off and

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.570 
unplug the dryer take this cover off and
check<00:01:24.760> could<00:01:25.180> be<00:01:25.299> carbon<00:01:25.540> dup<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:27.310> might<00:01:27.490> be

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
check could be carbon dup you might be

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.340 
check could be carbon dup you might be
able<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.790> put<00:01:28.150> some<00:01:28.299> sandpaper<00:01:28.570> contact

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
able to put some sandpaper contact

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.170 
able to put some sandpaper contact
cleaner<00:01:29.560> inside<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.520> get<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.030> work

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
cleaner inside down and get it to work

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.600 
cleaner inside down and get it to work
again<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.630> do<00:01:32.350> not<00:01:32.560> recommend<00:01:32.920> bypassing<00:01:33.580> that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
again I do not recommend bypassing that

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.310 
again I do not recommend bypassing that
switch<00:01:33.939> because<00:01:34.720> then<00:01:34.900> your<00:01:34.990> heater<00:01:35.140> will

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
switch because then your heater will

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.230 
switch because then your heater will
stay<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.799> when<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> motors<00:01:36.580> not<00:01:36.700> running<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
stay on when the motors not running and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.149 
stay on when the motors not running and
that's<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.990> fire<00:01:38.320> hazard<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.950> definitely

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
that's a fire hazard so you definitely

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.149 
that's a fire hazard so you definitely
do<00:01:39.640> not<00:01:39.790> want<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.060> bypass<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.420> switch<00:01:41.159> but

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
do not want to bypass that switch but

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.620 
do not want to bypass that switch but
you<00:01:42.250> will<00:01:42.369> find<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.850> couple<00:01:42.970> big<00:01:43.240> red<00:01:43.420> wires

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
you will find a couple big red wires

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.929 
you will find a couple big red wires
that<00:01:44.560> plug<00:01:44.830> in<00:01:44.979> where<00:01:45.130> these<00:01:45.220> alligator<00:01:45.640> clips

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
that plug in where these alligator clips

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.050 
that plug in where these alligator clips
are<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.670> little<00:01:48.939> switch<00:01:49.150> right<00:01:49.210> there

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
are and that little switch right there

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.719 
are and that little switch right there
is<00:01:52.060> what<00:01:52.900> makes<00:01:53.049> your<00:01:53.200> eater<00:01:53.380> heat<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.490> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
is what makes your eater heat up and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.780 
is what makes your eater heat up and
that<00:01:55.600> could<00:01:55.810> potentially<00:01:55.930> be<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:57.400> problem

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
that could potentially be the problem

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.080 
that could potentially be the problem
with<00:01:58.000> your<00:01:58.299> dryer<00:01:58.540> not<00:01:58.750> heating<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.880> there<00:02:01.000> you

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
with your dryer not heating so there you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.440
