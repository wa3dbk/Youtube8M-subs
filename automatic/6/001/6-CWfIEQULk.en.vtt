00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 Last weeks, we have made a percent with our snowmaking system 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.470
 Strongest choice in the statute in clear we do not know Tyrolean 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.450
 AllgÃ¤u it is just a family 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.290
 Yes we are 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.000
 actually a German economy driven from earlier on 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 bridged by means of Muralt areas 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.620
 and today the remainders are also for example German postal code postcode 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.320
 Postcode love them but not only are Chef Dirk not found in 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.490

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.490
 a bit yes we had the big problem a thousand years ago as well with the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.069
 Baby carriage how can we get the kids better Indian media and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.970
 how can she better ski markets 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.579
 then came on it was 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.599
 this one 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.269
 For one thing, what you build a chairlift is the children secured No and so on 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.000
 Of course threatened to have a children's land, so it's off to Beypiel 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.590
 both kids German it starts on the EC US and how special the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.979
 on the floor heaters cinemas looked wonderfully warm 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.589
 then of course we have 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:38.849
 Children are teaching Jana there with all rule with Magda fail campfire 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.179
 Campfire where of course an ulterior motive is open the sausages 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.369
 Barbecue Camping in the campfire 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.319
 then of course we have 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.089
 the bouncy castle the big Uli Klein they liberate natural risks and that 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:56.289
 Carousel in the snow Dr so everything just about the kids very slowly 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.199
 to lead the heavier and the magic carpet where they can drive 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.900
 two pieces to year we have 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050
 two volumes surfer conveyor belts 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.100
 where the little ones have already been the transport and the precursor 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.989
 to have been rare 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.629
 where the kids like to go the parents have to go and drummer too 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.450
 this kids land with all these facilities this year 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.039
 Something new was added 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.489
 This self-catering snack bar we can all families with their own 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.019
 Children with their own bread have come this way especially come 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.510
 and here to cut costs at the expense of skiing 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.169
 but already get a lot of encouragement when she is beautiful as you are called 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.669
 Separate one can easily settle with the small Rotert were 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.769
 and while the parents 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.890
 They can lean back and say "relax" 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.309
 Children in good hands yes Cancellara not shut off all that 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:52.260
 nothing can happen food everything simple technical facilities where 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.689
 nothing can happen 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.559
 Of course we have our most uncle he is watching the whole thing 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.999
 the bus to see that nothing happens that everything is OK 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.199
 and so have the parents too 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.449
 Of course, rest can be done in a reclining chair 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.969
 You can watch the whole thing in the sun to see her little one now 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.319
 slowly but surely see the success of what they here in this Kinderland in this 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.319
 mostly have the kids the young athlete 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.630
 our conclusion in five voices the children push this symptom too many fun 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:27.699
 50 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.220
 Setting standards in the Alps puts parents and children in a squint
