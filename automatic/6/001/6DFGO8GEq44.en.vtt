00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
wasn't trying to win over a giant

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.019 
wasn't trying to win over a giant
audience<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.860> happens<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.489> when<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
audience but as it happens like when you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.339 
audience but as it happens like when you
have<00:00:30.239> a<00:00:30.270> giant<00:00:30.509> audience<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.050> you're<00:00:31.140> doing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
have a giant audience and you're doing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
have a giant audience and you're doing
these<00:00:31.439> things<00:00:31.649> you<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.460> find<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.210> voice<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
these things you do find a voice that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.479 
these things you do find a voice that
appeals<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> people<00:00:34.440> what's<00:00:34.980> great<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
appeals to people what's great about the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
appeals to people what's great about the
indie<00:00:35.730> scene<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.559> really

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
indie scene is that they don't really

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.189 
indie scene is that they don't really
stick<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> rules<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.910> game<00:00:39.239> design<00:00:39.660> right

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
stick to the rules of game design right

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.200 
stick to the rules of game design right
for<00:00:40.469> instance<00:00:40.769> we<00:00:40.949> connect<00:00:41.340> lots<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> people

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
for instance we connect lots of people

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.639 
for instance we connect lots of people
make<00:00:42.300> game<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.629> connect<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.199> not<00:00:43.350> require

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
make game we connect that do not require

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
make game we connect that do not require
the<00:00:43.800> controller<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> were<00:00:45.510> not

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the controller right and we were not

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.240 
the controller right and we were not
that<00:00:45.780> experienced<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.469> Kinect<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.190> we

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that experienced with Kinect but we

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.680 
that experienced with Kinect but we
don't<00:00:47.370> try<00:00:47.579> something<00:00:47.879> completely<00:00:47.969> new<00:00:48.449> so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
don't try something completely new so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.639 
don't try something completely new so
okay<00:00:49.019> we're<00:00:49.109> gonna<00:00:49.199> make<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
okay we're gonna make a game that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.590 
okay we're gonna make a game that
requires<00:00:49.949> a<00:00:50.190> Kinect<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.879> controller<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
requires a Kinect and a controller and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
requires a Kinect and a controller and
from<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.589> it<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.769> just<00:00:52.879> creativity

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
from there on it was just creativity

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.849 
from there on it was just creativity
right<00:00:54.089> we<00:00:54.600> didn't<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.989> any<00:00:55.140> constrain<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
right we didn't have any constrain and

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.220 
right we didn't have any constrain and
we<00:00:56.100> didn't<00:00:56.429> have<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.820> sell<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> title<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.140> was

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we didn't have to sell this title it was

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.560 
we didn't have to sell this title it was
just<00:00:58.469> trying<00:00:59.249> stuff<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.359> got

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
just trying stuff and that's how we got

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
just trying stuff and that's how we got
our<00:01:00.870> concept<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.679> I<00:01:01.829> believe<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.329> original

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
our concept which I believe is original

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
our concept which I believe is original
and<00:01:03.480> something<00:01:03.989> new<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.440> that's<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.370> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and something new and that's what the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
and something new and that's what the
industry<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:06.000> trying<00:01:06.630> new<00:01:06.810> things<00:01:06.840> new

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
industry is about trying new things new

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
industry is about trying new things new
state<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.190> place<00:01:08.430> new<00:01:09.030> rules<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> speed

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
state of place new rules it's the speed

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
state of place new rules it's the speed
of<00:01:10.440> iteration<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.160> can<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.550> can

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of iteration I think you can you can

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
of iteration I think you can you can
very<00:01:11.850> quickly<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.300> also<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.630> you've<00:01:12.750> got

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
very quickly and also that you've got

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
very quickly and also that you've got
very<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.170> ties<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:13.980> your<00:01:14.100> game<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.370> at

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
very little ties to what your game is at

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
very little ties to what your game is at
the<00:01:14.490> moment<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.480> go<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:15.900> expo<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the moment so if you go to an expo in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.630 
the moment so if you go to an expo in
terms<00:01:16.530> people<00:01:16.830> say<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.490> your

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
terms people say we really like your

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
terms people say we really like your
name<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> change<00:01:19.020> this

name but this we want to change this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.300 
name but this we want to change this
about<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.620> have<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> ability<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.190> then

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about it you have the ability to then

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
about it you have the ability to then
change<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> try<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.690> hope<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.110> way

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
change that try it I hope that's an way

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
change that try it I hope that's an way
to<00:01:22.200> change<00:01:22.470> back<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.370> an
