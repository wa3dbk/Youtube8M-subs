project 64 is a well-known emulator that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.869 
project 64 is a well-known emulator that
plays<00:00:11.340> 64<00:00:12.299> games<00:00:12.629> on<00:00:12.959> the<00:00:13.289> PC<00:00:13.609> it's<00:00:14.609> pretty

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
plays 64 games on the PC it's pretty

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.910 
plays 64 games on the PC it's pretty
good<00:00:15.109> but<00:00:16.109> there's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.350> feature<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
good but there's a feature in the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
good but there's a feature in the
emulator<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.699> many<00:00:17.850> people<00:00:17.970> know<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
emulator that not many people know of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.409 
emulator that not many people know of
it's<00:00:19.260> basically<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> widescreen<00:00:20.670> hack<00:00:21.119> that

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
it's basically a widescreen hack that

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.820 
it's basically a widescreen hack that
works<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.019> most<00:00:22.199> games

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
works on most games

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859 
works on most games
it<00:00:23.279> doesn't<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.789> stretch<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.329> image<00:00:24.509> you

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it doesn't just stretch the image you

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.589 
it doesn't just stretch the image you
actually<00:00:25.289> see<00:00:25.439> more<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.829> the<00:00:25.949> world<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
actually see more of the world and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
actually see more of the world and
Ocarina<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.689> Time<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.259> just<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.740> game<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
Ocarina of Time it's just the game to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:41.660 
Ocarina of Time it's just the game to
show<00:00:29.429> off<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.669> this<00:00:29.939> ability<00:00:40.100> you've<00:00:41.100> got<00:00:41.309> some

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
show off of this ability you've got some

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.029 
show off of this ability you've got some
pop-up<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.449> sides<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> world<00:00:43.170> where

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
pop-up on the sides of the world where

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.000 
pop-up on the sides of the world where
trees<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.390> into<00:00:45.570> focus<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> front

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
trees will come into focus in the front

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.630 
trees will come into focus in the front
and<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.030> works<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.890> HUD<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and but it works pretty well the HUD is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
and but it works pretty well the HUD is
all<00:00:51.030> centered<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
all centered and so you don't have to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
all centered and so you don't have to
look<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> sides<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.090> mind<00:00:54.539> there's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
look to the sides of your mind there's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.639 
look to the sides of your mind there's
you<00:00:54.929> see<00:00:55.170> everything<00:00:55.769> just<00:00:56.179> it's<00:00:57.179> very<00:00:57.780> very

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you see everything just it's very very

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.610 
you see everything just it's very very
immersive<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.179> makes<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.230> Zelda

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
immersive and it makes the Zelda

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:22.300 
immersive and it makes the Zelda
experience<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.760> better

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.920 

this<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> perfect<00:01:24.060> example<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
this is the perfect example of a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700 
this is the perfect example of a
cutscene<00:01:25.230> where<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.610> Fanny<00:01:27.120> definitely<00:01:28.020> shows

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
cutscene where I Fanny definitely shows

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.670 
cutscene where I Fanny definitely shows
you<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> lot<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:29.580> than<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.940> would<00:01:29.970> normally

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
you a lot more than you would normally

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
you a lot more than you would normally
you<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> sides<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you see things on the sides that you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.830 
you see things on the sides that you
won't<00:01:34.170> ever<00:01:34.410> see<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.980> 4x3<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> makes

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
won't ever see in 4x3 and it just makes

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.110 
won't ever see in 4x3 and it just makes
this<00:01:37.740> much<00:01:38.190> much<00:01:39.000> more<00:01:39.300> enjoyable<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
this much much more enjoyable this is

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.720 
this much much more enjoyable this is
another<00:01:45.420> great<00:01:45.690> example<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.980> cutscene<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
another great example of a cutscene that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.000 
another great example of a cutscene that
really<00:01:48.150> benefits<00:01:48.720> from<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.320> finiti<00:01:49.800> and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
really benefits from I finiti and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.030 
really benefits from I finiti and
surround<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:51.810> makes<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.140> cinematic<00:01:52.710> even

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
surround it just makes a cinematic even

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:08.480 
surround it just makes a cinematic even
more<00:01:53.400> cinematic<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.530> here's<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.980> drawback

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
more cinematic but here's the drawback

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.350 
more cinematic but here's the drawback
to<00:02:08.520> playing<00:02:08.970> old<00:02:09.330> 4x3<00:02:09.810> games<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.940> setup<00:02:12.240> like

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to playing old 4x3 games on a setup like

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750 
to playing old 4x3 games on a setup like
this<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.800> see<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> flames<00:02:14.430> coming

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
this because you see the flames coming

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
this because you see the flames coming
into<00:02:15.000> existence<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.320> front<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.650> your

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
into existence right in front of your

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
into existence right in front of your
face<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.700> doesn't<00:02:18.030> even<00:02:18.090> seem<00:02:18.420> like

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
face and it just doesn't even seem like

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.580 
face and it just doesn't even seem like
cannons<00:02:18.930> moving<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.840> gonna<00:02:25.080> go<00:02:25.260> ahead<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
cannons moving I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.130 
cannons moving I'm gonna go ahead and
show<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.100> gameplay

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.200 

right<00:02:32.140> here<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.830> shows<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.250> there's<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
right here it shows that there's a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.820 
right here it shows that there's a
center<00:02:34.830> where<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.400> don't<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.300> HUD

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
center where you don't have the HUD

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.920 
center where you don't have the HUD
extending<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.100> other<00:02:39.670> monitors<00:02:40.270> they're

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
extending to the other monitors they're

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.230 
extending to the other monitors they're
just<00:02:41.170> right<00:02:41.410> where<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.130> need<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.460> be<00:02:42.610> just

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
just right where you need to be just

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.370 
just right where you need to be just
like<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.600> you're<00:02:43.750> playing<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.350> game

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
like if you're playing the game

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.460 
like if you're playing the game
originally

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:06.610 

I<00:03:04.420> thought<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.600> section<00:03:06.080> right<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.470> would

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
I thought this section right here would

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.940 
I thought this section right here would
be<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.860> cool<00:03:07.360> spot<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.690> show<00:03:08.900> off<00:03:09.140> where<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> Fanny

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
be a cool spot to show off where I Fanny

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.210 
be a cool spot to show off where I Fanny
would<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.550> shine<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.840> spiral<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
would really shine to the spiral in the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:32.470 
would really shine to the spiral in the
hallway<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.330> kind<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.630> awesome

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.530 

this<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.140> in-game<00:03:35.120> pause<00:03:36.120> menu

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
this is what the in-game pause menu

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.540 
this is what the in-game pause menu
looks<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:37.020> everything<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.130> rendered

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
looks like everything is rendered

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.880 
looks like everything is rendered
correctly<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.870> also<00:03:40.080> whores<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.770> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
correctly and it's also whores on the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.720 
correctly and it's also whores on the
Plus<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.210> great<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.840> most<00:03:43.830> 2d<00:03:44.250> items

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
Plus this is great as most 2d items

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.080 
Plus this is great as most 2d items
usually<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.210> stretched<00:03:45.570> in<00:03:45.810> games<00:03:45.990> like<00:03:46.200> this

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.310 

it's<00:03:54.090> good<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.720> when<00:03:55.140> there's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
it's good to see that when there's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.470 
it's good to see that when there's
transitions<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.280> those<00:03:56.430> black<00:03:56.700> lines<00:03:56.760> going

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
transitions and those black lines going

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.150 
transitions and those black lines going
squelched<00:03:58.020> your<00:03:58.140> screen<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.650> top<00:03:58.890> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
squelched your screen on the top and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.130 
squelched your screen on the top and
bottom<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.670> it<00:04:00.000> happens<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
bottom that it happens to all the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.890 
bottom that it happens to all the
screens

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.170 

so<00:04:09.900> when<00:04:10.110> I<00:04:10.230> go<00:04:10.380> in<00:04:10.590> top<00:04:10.800> two<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.550> go<00:04:11.730> over<00:04:12.000> here

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
so when I go in top two and go over here

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.880 
so when I go in top two and go over here
you're<00:04:12.360> gonna<00:04:12.510> notice<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.080> Texas<00:04:13.500> Center

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
you're gonna notice that in Texas Center

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.460 
you're gonna notice that in Texas Center
and<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.130> great<00:04:14.490> it's<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.230> HUD

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and that's great it's not just the HUD

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
and that's great it's not just the HUD
that<00:04:16.829> it's<00:04:17.010> also<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.150> text<00:04:18.510> boxes<00:04:18.930> and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
that it's also all the text boxes and

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:19.970 
that it's also all the text boxes and
things<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:19.500> that

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
things like that

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.450 
things like that
if<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.880> was<00:04:21.060> stretched<00:04:21.480> then<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.530> game<00:04:22.770> would

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
if it was stretched then the game would

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.640 
if it was stretched then the game would
lose<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.760> lot<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.360> immersion<00:04:24.690> on<00:04:25.080> top<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.530> that

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
lose a lot of immersion on top of that

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.220 
lose a lot of immersion on top of that
you'd<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.040> back<00:04:26.730> up<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.270> look<00:04:27.300> at<00:04:27.780> all<00:04:28.050> of

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
you'd have to back up and look at all of

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.380 
you'd have to back up and look at all of
the<00:04:28.500> monitors<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.250> order<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.580> read<00:04:29.820> what<00:04:30.270> was

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
the monitors in order to read what was

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
through it or the other monitors because

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.860 
through it or the other monitors because
it<00:04:59.590> wasn't<00:04:59.889> designed<00:05:00.009> for<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.699> but<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.509> doesn't

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
it wasn't designed for it but it doesn't

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.600 
it wasn't designed for it but it doesn't
know<00:05:01.990> right<00:05:02.259> job<00:05:02.529> and<00:05:02.800> it<00:05:02.860> doesn't<00:05:03.009> really<00:05:03.249> put

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
know right job and it doesn't really put

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:20.870 
know right job and it doesn't really put
any<00:05:03.729> favors<00:05:04.120> on<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.419> much
