00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
30 minutes to figure out how to compact

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.630 
30 minutes to figure out how to compact
this<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.789> didn't<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.050> once<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.859> knew<00:00:26.369> how

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
this I didn't know that once I knew how
to<00:00:26.699> build<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.990> wouldn't<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.619> hard

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to build it that it wouldn't be so hard

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.880

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
one first okay this one you just flip

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.870 
one first okay this one you just flip
the<00:01:26.159> lever<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:27.450> goes<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:28.130> flip<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> lever<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the lever it goes down flip the lever it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.920 
the lever it goes down flip the lever it
goes<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> course<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.659> wouldn't<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
goes up of course there wouldn't be a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.999 
goes up of course there wouldn't be a
lover<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> hook<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> team

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
lover there you can hook up a team

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.380 
lover there you can hook up a team
flip-flop<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.939> hook<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> any

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
flip-flop right here and hook it to any

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
flip-flop right here and hook it to any
part<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:33.990> stone<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
part of this right stone right here so I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
part of this right stone right here so I
built<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> way<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> actually

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
built it this way to this is actually

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
built it this way to this is actually
the<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.360> gonna<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> tutorial<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the way I was gonna do the tutorial on

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.780 
the way I was gonna do the tutorial on
and<00:01:41.810> then<00:01:42.810> watch<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.350> ok<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.579> it

and then watch this ok I got it up it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
and then watch this ok I got it up it
goes<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.060> fine<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.930> when<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> click<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
goes up fine and then when you click it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.330 
goes up fine and then when you click it
down<00:01:48.020> what<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.590> hell<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:51.329> on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.029 

so<00:01:55.329> it<00:01:55.539> literally<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.020> took<00:01:56.170> me<00:01:56.229> about<00:01:56.710> 30

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
so it literally it took me about 30

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.300 
so it literally it took me about 30
minutes<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.700> compact<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.509> thing<00:01:58.719> right<00:01:58.960> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
minutes to compact this thing right and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.529 
minutes to compact this thing right and
then<00:02:00.310> when<00:02:00.429> I<00:02:00.460> built<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.060> way<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.270> was<00:02:01.450> like

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
then when I built it this way I was like

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.169 
then when I built it this way I was like
oh<00:02:01.719> damn<00:02:02.079> so<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.710> started<00:02:03.490> building<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
oh damn so I started building and it

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.279 
oh damn so I started building and it
took<00:02:04.390> me<00:02:04.689> one<00:02:05.530> hour<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.369> like<00:02:06.880> 40<00:02:07.450> minutes<00:02:07.719> to

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
took me one hour and like 40 minutes to

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.410 
took me one hour and like 40 minutes to
figure<00:02:08.560> out<00:02:08.890> how<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.160> get<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.459> built<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.060> this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
figure out how to get it built in this

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.050 
figure out how to get it built in this
direction<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.319> literally<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.849> easy

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
direction and literally it was the easy

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.210 
direction and literally it was the easy
it<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.599> really<00:02:14.140> easy<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.560> actually<00:02:15.069> figure

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
it was really easy to actually figure

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.800 
it was really easy to actually figure
out<00:02:15.340> how<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:15.879> but<00:02:16.360> once<00:02:16.510> you've<00:02:16.629> got

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
out how to do it but once you've got

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.539 
out how to do it but once you've got
something<00:02:17.019> built<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.769> kind<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.099> like<00:02:18.250> it's

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
something built it's kind of like it's

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.729 
something built it's kind of like it's
difficult<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.390> realize<00:02:20.110> how<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.319> do<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
difficult to realize how to do it in a

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.839 
difficult to realize how to do it in a
different<00:02:20.980> direction<00:02:21.220> because<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.730> don't

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
different direction because you don't

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.610 
different direction because you don't
want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.060> completely<00:02:22.750> change<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.379> whole

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
want to completely change the whole

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.580 
want to completely change the whole
thing<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.110> annoying<00:02:26.260> so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
thing it's just it's just so annoying so

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.080 
thing it's just it's just so annoying so
all<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.769> had<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.920> really<00:02:27.099> do<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:27.579> add<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:27.940> an

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
all I had to really do is just add on an

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.809 
all I had to really do is just add on an
extra<00:02:28.180> part<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:29.190> over<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.640> notice

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
extra part so over here you can notice

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.250 
extra part so over here you can notice
that<00:02:31.120> there's<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.480> one<00:02:31.690> run<00:02:31.840> part<00:02:32.140> right

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
that there's this one run part right

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.470 
that there's this one run part right
here<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.620> there's<00:02:32.769> nothing<00:02:33.130> here<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.180> this

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
here but there's nothing here so in this

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.350 
here but there's nothing here so in this
direction<00:02:34.720> going<00:02:35.200> towards<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.640> west<00:02:36.819> because

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
direction going towards the west because

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.449 
direction going towards the west because
west<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.840> south<00:02:38.079> are<00:02:38.319> different<00:02:38.860> from<00:02:39.040> north

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
west and south are different from north

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.430 
west and south are different from north
and<00:02:39.790> east<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> going<00:02:42.730> from<00:02:43.000> south<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.660> had<00:02:44.319> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
and east so going from south I had to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.360 
and east so going from south I had to
add<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.680> an<00:02:44.829> extra<00:02:44.920> part<00:02:45.310> right<00:02:45.459> here<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:47.310> had<00:02:48.310> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
add on an extra part right here I had to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.890 
add on an extra part right here I had to
drop<00:02:48.549> this<00:02:48.760> repeater<00:02:49.120> used<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.510> four<00:02:49.690> tix

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
drop this repeater used to be four tix

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.650 
drop this repeater used to be four tix
had<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.110> drop<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.560> one<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.390> had<00:02:52.540> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
had to drop it to one and then I had to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.479 
had to drop it to one and then I had to
add<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.959> two<00:02:53.170> more<00:02:53.349> for<00:02:53.650> repeaters<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.129> a

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
add on two more for repeaters and a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.119 
add on two more for repeaters and a
repeater<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.150> three<00:02:55.510> now<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.530> reason<00:02:56.799> why<00:02:57.069> it

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
repeater on three now the reason why it

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.170 
repeater on three now the reason why it
was<00:02:57.549> uh<00:02:58.049> on<00:02:59.049> an<00:02:59.829> infinite<00:03:00.280> switch<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.970> an

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
was uh on an infinite switch on an

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.030 
was uh on an infinite switch on an
infinite<00:03:01.510> loop<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.930> because<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.799> right

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
infinite loop is because of this right

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.039 
infinite loop is because of this right
here<00:03:03.340> for<00:03:03.940> some<00:03:04.150> reason<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.660> build<00:03:04.870> it

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
here for some reason when you build it

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.210 
here for some reason when you build it
towards<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:06.480> North<00:03:07.480> or<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.780> east<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:09.069> can

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
towards the North or the east you can

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.710 
towards the North or the east you can
have<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.519> piece<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.970> redstone<00:03:10.120> dust<00:03:10.480> right

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
have this piece of redstone dust right

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.990 
have this piece of redstone dust right
here<00:03:10.989> but<00:03:11.590> technically<00:03:12.069> on<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.670> side<00:03:12.849> of

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
here but technically on this side of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.539 
here but technically on this side of
this<00:03:13.090> redstone<00:03:13.450> dust<00:03:13.750> right<00:03:14.410> here<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.040> torch

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
this redstone dust right here is a torch

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.390 
this redstone dust right here is a torch
and<00:03:16.109> then<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.319> a<00:03:17.349> repeater<00:03:17.859> going<00:03:18.190> right

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
and then you have a repeater going right

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400 
and then you have a repeater going right
here<00:03:18.639> so<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.209> course<00:03:19.239> if<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.780> repeater<00:03:20.139> hits

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
here so of course if the repeater hits

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.170 
here so of course if the repeater hits
the<00:03:20.530> dust<00:03:20.799> hits<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.220> torch<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:22.030> gonna

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
the dust hits the torch then it's gonna

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.180 
the dust hits the torch then it's gonna
loop<00:03:22.540> back<00:03:22.900> around<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.739> keep<00:03:23.919> looping

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
loop back around and just keep looping

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.220 
loop back around and just keep looping
and<00:03:24.579> looping<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:25.150> looping<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.720> looping<00:03:25.750> and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
and looping and looping and looping and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.349 
and looping and looping and looping and
that's<00:03:26.349> why<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> was<00:03:26.680> doing<00:03:26.919> that<00:03:26.950> stupid

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
that's why I was doing that stupid

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.610 
that's why I was doing that stupid
shuttering<00:03:28.359> motion<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.019> here<00:03:29.260> that's<00:03:29.440> why<00:03:29.560> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
shuttering motion up here that's why I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.720 
shuttering motion up here that's why I
kept<00:03:29.829> doing<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.930> flip<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
kept doing this so if I flip this it

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.789 
kept doing this so if I flip this it
starts<00:03:34.030> going<00:03:34.120> crazy<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.750> over<00:03:35.349> here

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
starts going crazy because over here

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.630 
starts going crazy because over here

where is that does I there it is
see<00:03:40.180> how<00:03:40.240> it<00:03:40.300> keeps<00:03:40.510> going<00:03:40.990> on<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.319> off<00:03:41.800> on<00:03:42.160> and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
see how it keeps going on and off on and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.580 
see how it keeps going on and off on and
off<00:03:42.520> its<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:43.300> some<00:03:43.510> reason<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.930> does<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.440> this

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
off its for some reason it does it this

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.220 
off its for some reason it does it this
direction<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.480> direction<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.050> won't

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
direction but in this direction it won't

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.980 
direction but in this direction it won't
do<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.650> don't<00:03:47.740> know<00:03:47.980> why<00:03:48.540> honestly<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.660> don't

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
do it I don't know why honestly I don't

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.240 
do it I don't know why honestly I don't
know<00:03:50.230> why<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.470> won't<00:03:50.830> do<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.160> this

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
know why it won't do it in this

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.220 
know why it won't do it in this
direction<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.180> makes<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:52.900> compact

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
direction but it makes it more compact

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.910 
direction but it makes it more compact
this<00:03:53.500> way<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.860> don't<00:03:53.890> care<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:55.150> works<00:03:55.920> so

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
this way so I don't care it works so

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.430 
this way so I don't care it works so
when<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.160> built<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.820> way<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.330> had<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.900> delete

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
when I built it this way I had to delete

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.650 
when I built it this way I had to delete
that<00:03:59.500> one<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.430> one<00:04:00.610> go<00:04:00.880> down<00:04:01.180> an<00:04:01.360> extra

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660

block that hooks to any of this redstone
over<00:04:48.190> here<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.490> if<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.640> put<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:48.940> here<00:04:49.470> goes<00:04:50.470> up

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
over here so if I put it here goes up

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.120 
over here so if I put it here goes up
come<00:04:52.240> down<00:04:52.540> fine<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.500> put<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.550> over<00:04:54.669> here<00:04:56.130> goes

come down fine I put it over here goes
up<00:04:58.590> comes<00:04:59.590> down<00:04:59.890> just<00:05:00.370> as<00:05:00.520> fine<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.380> then<00:05:02.380> you

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
up comes down just as fine and then you

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.010 
up comes down just as fine and then you
come<00:05:02.650> back<00:05:02.680> over<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.340> one<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:04.780> put<00:05:04.990> a

come back over to this one you put a

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.740 
come back over to this one you put a
same<00:05:05.590> spot<00:05:05.950> as<00:05:06.160> i<00:05:06.340> did<00:05:06.460> over<00:05:06.580> there<00:05:06.850> goes<00:05:07.479> up

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
same spot as i did over there goes up

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.390 
same spot as i did over there goes up
and<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:09.520> goes<00:05:09.790> retarded<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.950> only<00:05:12.100> works

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
and then goes retarded so it only works

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.960 
and then goes retarded so it only works
off<00:05:12.580> this<00:05:12.760> one<00:05:12.970> block<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:15.310> when<00:05:15.460> i<00:05:15.490> do<00:05:15.610> make<00:05:15.850> the

off this one block so when i do make the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.310 
off this one block so when i do make the
tutorial<00:05:16.479> i<00:05:16.600> will<00:05:16.630> show<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.020> both<00:05:17.260> ways

on<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.640> I<00:05:33.789> built<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.390> three<00:05:35.380> by<00:05:35.530> three<00:05:35.560> flush

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
on it I built a three by three flush

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.469 
on it I built a three by three flush
piston<00:05:37.410> so<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.800> think<00:05:39.460> it's<00:05:39.789> really<00:05:39.970> cool<00:05:40.240> but

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479

mean look at this back here it's just a
big<00:06:19.919> ass<00:06:20.099> mess<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.639> gotta<00:06:21.060> fix<00:06:21.270> this<00:06:21.509> before

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
big ass mess and I gotta fix this before

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.050 
big ass mess and I gotta fix this before
I<00:06:21.870> decide<00:06:22.470> to<00:06:22.500> do<00:06:22.710> a<00:06:22.740> tutorial<00:06:22.919> on<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.370> but<00:06:24.030> I

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
I decide to do a tutorial on it but I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.990 
I decide to do a tutorial on it but I
know<00:06:24.150> people<00:06:24.240> like<00:06:24.660> doors<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:26.009> whatnot<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:26.970> I

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
know people like doors and whatnot so I

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.969 
know people like doors and whatnot so I
thought<00:06:27.210> I'd<00:06:27.389> do<00:06:27.569> a<00:06:27.599> flush<00:06:28.020> piston<00:06:28.470> three<00:06:28.860> by

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
thought I'd do a flush piston three by

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.870 
thought I'd do a flush piston three by
three<00:06:29.280> it's<00:06:29.580> pretty<00:06:29.699> cool<00:06:30.830> works<00:06:31.830> fine<00:06:32.099> like<00:06:32.759> I

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
three it's pretty cool works fine like I

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.540 
three it's pretty cool works fine like I
said<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:33.120> just<00:06:33.240> needs<00:06:33.509> more<00:06:33.630> compacting<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:35.520> i

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
said it just needs more compacting so i

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.950 
said it just needs more compacting so i
got<00:06:35.849> this<00:06:35.970> compactor<00:06:36.479> right<00:06:36.599> here<00:06:36.720> i'll<00:06:36.810> be

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
got this compactor right here i'll be

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.870 
got this compactor right here i'll be
doing<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.349> tutorial<00:06:37.470> on<00:06:37.889> that<00:06:38.099> hopefully<00:06:38.550> soon
