00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Talk this year and these are five 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.100
 unknown animals you have to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 to see 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 you've probably found that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.370
 limit to you the thing but give a world 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.679
 and then when are you going to tell me 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 realized that no other friends knew 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.760
 but that no legal thing then made a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.350
 listing with five games that I like 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 much and are completely 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.240
 are unknown there for most of the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 people who like nike in brazil 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 I'll tell them they're my friends. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 Anyway, if you have any suggestion of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.790
 This is the name of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.860
 comments and tells me that I 'm 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.420
 doing a series with this will have more 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.200
 an episode about an unknown 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.050
 you have to see 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.879
 I've done at least three videos there with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
 suggestions of mood differently than I 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 I watched that no one knows which are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 very cool 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 then there is just so here we then get 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 with the first enemy air side I go 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.309
 start with the best of spirit 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 forgetful of all good is not for you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 to watch here because he is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 very cool this game goes on 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 hell here is cool where the feet one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 vampire boss of a great enemy of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.710
 demon are all the club and a 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.369
 an admirer of screen pop culture and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.780
 Carlos was very funny at his idea. 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 It's very cool, I love this character. 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 very much but nobody knows this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.220
 I fucking according to emi on our list is 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 Coconut in Brazil, I do not know how to speak right. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.180
 no one is going to see it's very cool 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.009
 this has not understood anything of the title 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 story more or less so murakami 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 who is the protagonist of the story he was 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.220
 in love with a girl named coroné 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 which he called a childhood doll 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.829
 and that's the beautiful day on the subject 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.390
 there measure 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.979
 and she says she had contact with the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 aliens and everything else but obviously 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.960
 nobody believes her so she decides 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.329
 to prove a friend of her murakami that she 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.840
 really has contact with aliens and 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.600
 she summons the aliens to show 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.789
 For me it gives something wrong. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.399
 here is the girl dies and the guy stays 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.259
 admitted to hospital was yesterday 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 some years after the hurricane 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.069
 he recovers he starts to get 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.810
 completely obsessed with aliens 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.170
 because of a promise he made 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.930
 to coroné kuhn and in school class 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.269
 him enters a girl transferred from 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.819
 another school called coroné cgu and 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.340
 who is a partner similar to the coroné 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.980
 even there he says that he already knew her 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.860
 I do not know how is your obvious and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.220
 Boy do not believe she said never 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.230
 He knew he would continue but this girl 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.000
 she has telekinetic powers she has a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.220
 strength over human she foresees the future 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.750
 also each album type that has some 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.940
 thing happening is a really cool anime 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.170
 I think everyone should bcn euphoria 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.959
 the whole video said still explaining 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.359
 every little thing and in speaking that I think 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.069
 that every small kitchen is because I 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.290
 I really like the theme. I think it's a theme. 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.910
 interesting I'm kind 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.070
 the poop net 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.810
 the story of four members who 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.120
 are part of a study cluster 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.190
 which is really nothing more than a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.690
 cube because in schools 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.700
 Japanese, you have to participate in 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.170
 club during high school and with 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.420
 these four will not occur any give 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.730
 life to them made a fictitious club 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.820
 ghost would qualify book was not 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 condemned and gets a note in the fruit of the ego 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.350
 suddenly the souls they begin to 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.290
 to randomly change the body between 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.570
 the 4 to gpu all one discovers that another 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.610
 friend likes her, the way she finds out 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.510
 the other is strange way late is a 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.370
 comedy team and I love that I said no 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.550
 I can not understand my 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.140
 head as either proxy did not do the same 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.420
 success you should not fear done here in 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.100
 brazil, this food is expensive bull and if 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.380
 passes in a futuristic city where 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.300
 humans and robots can live side by side 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.460
 side as equals on account of a system 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.230
 that makes humans leave 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.600
 your emotions from side to side 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.250
 torn by a homicide, and history 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.130
 developed from the investigation of this 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.110
 crime to see does not matter if only has guy and 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.330
 anime is as its name says it 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.390
 do in April bach which is a neighborhood of 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.480
 japan that has many statues of 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.250
 guardians as they protect the city is 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.470
 protect people and families from 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.240
 more is that neither mullan has several 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.310
 guardians of stone until a 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.620
 You do not want to break one of these 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.780
 status and in this a lot of weird things 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.910
 this happens to me at 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.320
 disappearance of two children who are 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.470
 sent to various dimensions 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.330
 different ones and their goal can be 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.580
 Come home with more or less than 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.560
 no campaign of the Japanese dragon is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.420
