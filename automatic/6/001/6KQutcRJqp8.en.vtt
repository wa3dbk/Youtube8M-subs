because<00:01:46.109> we<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.889> just<00:01:47.039> don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.549> at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because we really just don't know at

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.789 
because we really just don't know at
this<00:01:47.909> point<00:01:48.029> we<00:01:48.689> did<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.109> a<00:01:49.170> bunch<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.529> leaked

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this point we did get a bunch of leaked

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
this point we did get a bunch of leaked
information<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.579> may<00:01:50.789> or<00:01:50.909> may<00:01:51.029> not<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.270> true

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
information that may or may not be true

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
information that may or may not be true
that<00:01:51.749> could<00:01:52.200> point<00:01:52.679> us<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> direction<00:01:53.159> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that could point us to the direction of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
that could point us to the direction of
Samantha<00:01:54.119> being<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.479> control<00:01:54.779> the<00:01:55.020> zombies

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
Samantha being in control the zombies

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
Samantha being in control the zombies
once<00:01:55.950> again<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.029> might<00:01:57.209> have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> nazi

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
once again because we might have a nazi

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.269 
once again because we might have a nazi
zombies<00:01:58.499> map<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:58.889> i<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:59.099> make<00:01:59.249> another

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
zombies map and i might make another

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.389 
zombies map and i might make another
video<00:01:59.789> on<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.509> later<00:02:00.779> but<00:02:01.380> still<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:02.130> really

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
video on that later but still we really

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
video on that later but still we really
just<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.909> confirmation<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.899> who's<00:02:04.229> in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
just don't have confirmation on who's in

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.159 
just don't have confirmation on who's in
control<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.039> still<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.029> someone<00:02:06.990> else

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:07.169 
control it still could be someone else

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.020 
control it still could be someone else
entirely<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.829> could<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.160> Max's<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.849> time

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
entirely it could be Max's this time

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
entirely it could be Max's this time
around<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.420> want<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.630> propose<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.470> idea

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
around I want to propose a little idea

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
around I want to propose a little idea
not<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> theory<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.510> there's<00:02:12.990> no

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
not really a theory because there's no

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.870 
not really a theory because there's no
proof<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.920> whatsoever<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.670> just

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
proof to this whatsoever but just

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.369 
proof to this whatsoever but just
something<00:02:15.180> I've<00:02:15.270> always<00:02:15.360> sort<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> wanted<00:02:16.079> to

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
something I've always sort of wanted to

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.839 
something I've always sort of wanted to
happen<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> zombies<00:02:17.310> storyline<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.700> might

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
happen in the zombies storyline I might

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.780 
happen in the zombies storyline I might
be<00:02:18.000> stupid<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.480> some<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> guys<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.230> guys

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
be stupid to some of you guys you guys

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
be stupid to some of you guys you guys
I<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.180> I'm<00:02:20.599> just<00:02:20.659> dumb<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:21.500> just

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
I think I'm just I'm just dumb I'm just

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.069 
I think I'm just I'm just dumb I'm just
blabbering<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.549> nothing<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.689> terms<00:02:23.900> of

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
blabbering about nothing but in terms of

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.199 
blabbering about nothing but in terms of
our<00:02:24.260> zombies<00:02:24.739> storyline<00:02:25.010> I've<00:02:25.489> always<00:02:25.790> sort

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
our zombies storyline I've always sort

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.929 
our zombies storyline I've always sort
of<00:02:26.329> wanted<00:02:26.510> Max's<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.469> be<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.739> final<00:02:28.340> guy<00:02:28.549> and

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
of wanted Max's to be the final guy and

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.449 
of wanted Max's to be the final guy and
control<00:02:29.719> in<00:02:29.959> black<00:02:30.200> ops<00:02:30.409> 3<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.709> always<00:02:31.069> pictured

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
control in black ops 3 I always pictured

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.089 
control in black ops 3 I always pictured
Maxis<00:02:32.030> being<00:02:32.659> the<00:02:33.079> last<00:02:33.409> main<00:02:33.890> guy

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
Maxis being the last main guy

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.380 
Maxis being the last main guy
controlling<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> zombies<00:02:35.120> through<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
controlling the zombies through the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
controlling the zombies through the
ether<00:02:35.689> and<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.349> always<00:02:36.859> wanted<00:02:37.129> that<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
ether and I just I always wanted that to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.000 
ether and I just I always wanted that to
happen<00:02:37.459> ever<00:02:38.030> since<00:02:38.450> black<00:02:38.900> ops<00:02:39.140> 2<00:02:39.500> began

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
happen ever since black ops 2 began

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.679 
happen ever since black ops 2 began
that's<00:02:40.549> just<00:02:40.760> kind<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.000> been<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.329> little

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
that's just kind of been like a little

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.179 
that's just kind of been like a little
theory<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.349> back<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.709> my<00:02:42.829> mind<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.159> always

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
theory in the back of my mind I always

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.710 
theory in the back of my mind I always
want<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:43.640> happen<00:02:43.909> there<00:02:44.000> was<00:02:44.120> never<00:02:44.239> any<00:02:44.390> proof

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
want to happen there was never any proof

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.360 
want to happen there was never any proof
to<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.769> something<00:02:46.129> that<00:02:46.250> I've

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
to that all this is something that I've

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.030 
to that all this is something that I've
always<00:02:46.609> wanted<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.659> see<00:02:47.959> come<00:02:48.590> because

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
always wanted to see come because

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.309 
always wanted to see come because
basically<00:02:49.670> Maxis<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.719> coolest<00:02:50.959> character

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
basically Maxis is the coolest character

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.649 
basically Maxis is the coolest character
in<00:02:51.739> my<00:02:51.920> eyes<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.280> yes<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.700> know<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.909> buried<00:02:53.510> he

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
in my eyes and yes I know and buried he

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.379 
in my eyes and yes I know and buried he
did<00:02:53.930> get<00:02:54.319> control<00:02:54.859> at<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.519> very<00:02:55.819> end<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.239> that

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
did get control at the very end but that

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.240 
did get control at the very end but that
was<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:57.200> know<00:02:57.319> an<00:02:57.379> alternate<00:02:57.859> ending<00:02:58.099> there

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
was a you know an alternate ending there

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.640 
was a you know an alternate ending there
was<00:02:58.430> no<00:02:58.609> true<00:02:59.030> ending<00:02:59.480> there<00:02:59.750> but<00:03:00.230> I've<00:03:00.379> always

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
was no true ending there but I've always

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.679 
was no true ending there but I've always
wanted<00:03:01.010> especially<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.060> next<00:03:02.359> game<00:03:02.510> in

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
wanted especially in the next game in

wanted especially in the next game in
black<00:03:02.900> ops<00:03:03.079> 3<00:03:03.200> i've<00:03:03.409> always<00:03:03.650> wanted<00:03:03.769> max's<00:03:04.310> to

be very odd it's say in black ops 3 if
we<00:04:05.689> had<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.019> alternate<00:04:06.709> timeline<00:04:07.220> this

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
we had this alternate timeline this

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.819 
we had this alternate timeline this
alternate<00:04:07.970> loop<00:04:08.209> or<00:04:08.689> instead<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.049> Richthofen

becoming the god of the zombies mode it

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.949 
becoming the god of the zombies mode it
really<00:04:12.949> is<00:04:13.129> Maxis<00:04:13.729> in<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.030> end<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.359> just<00:04:14.599> always
