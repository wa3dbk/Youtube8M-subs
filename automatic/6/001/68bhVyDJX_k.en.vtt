can succeed where as well definitely

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
can succeed where as well definitely
with<00:01:31.860> triage<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.880> succeed<00:01:33.329> as

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
with triage I think I could succeed as

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.539 
with triage I think I could succeed as
well<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> I'd<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> pick<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
well but you know I'd have to pick the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
well but you know I'd have to pick the
between<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.869> i<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> doom

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
between the two and i think that doom

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
between the two and i think that doom
for<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.360> bit<00:01:39.509> better<00:01:39.659> i<00:01:39.840> love<00:01:39.960> try

h i love all the guys in it and but i

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
h i love all the guys in it and but i
think<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.229> screaming<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
think that screaming for me is going to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.240 
think that screaming for me is going to
be<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.659> less<00:01:45.869> consistent<00:01:46.380> during

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
be a little bit less consistent during

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.380 
be a little bit less consistent during
the<00:01:47.340> school<00:01:47.640> year<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.970> stuff<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the school year and stuff like that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
the school year and stuff like that
obviously<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> youtube<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
obviously so i think that youtube is the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
obviously so i think that youtube is the
way<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.470> enjoy<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.009> I

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.920 
every two weeks whereas do my can get an
upload<00:03:18.190> essentially<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.450> couple<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.870> days

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
upload essentially in a couple of days

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.979 
upload essentially in a couple of days
or<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:21.130> day<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.730> submit<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> video<00:03:22.480> so

or that day that I submit a video so

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.930 
or that day that I submit a video so
it's<00:03:23.260> much<00:03:23.440> better<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:24.160> terms<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.519> how<00:03:24.700> many

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it's much better in terms of how many

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.610 
it's much better in terms of how many
uploads<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.540> get<00:03:25.780> yes<00:03:26.019> I'd<00:03:26.200> get<00:03:26.410> more

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
uploads I get yes I'd get more

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.860 
uploads I get yes I'd get more
subscribers<00:03:26.769> off<00:03:27.340> carnage<00:03:27.790> /<00:03:28.060> upload<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.840> I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
subscribers off carnage / upload but I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.289 
subscribers off carnage / upload but I
think<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.500> more<00:03:29.769> uploads<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.430> doom<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.060> I

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
think I get more uploads on doom and I

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.120 
think I get more uploads on doom and I
think<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.750> would<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:32.109> it's<00:03:32.410> better<00:03:32.799> for

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
think that it would be it's better for

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.039 
think that it would be it's better for
me<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.400> terms<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.730> YouTube<00:03:34.150> as<00:03:34.299> well<00:03:34.359> as<00:03:34.870> on

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
me in terms of YouTube as well as on

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.839 
me in terms of YouTube as well as on
Twitch<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.739> provides<00:03:36.250> me<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> lot<00:03:36.730> of

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
Twitch it provides me a lot of

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.330 
Twitch it provides me a lot of
connections<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:38.109> know<00:03:38.200> carnage<00:03:38.590> doesn't

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
connections and you know carnage doesn't

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.550 
connections and you know carnage doesn't
really<00:03:39.489> involve<00:03:40.120> itself<00:03:40.389> with<00:03:40.810> twitch<00:03:41.169> at<00:03:41.380> all

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
really involve itself with twitch at all

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.710 
really involve itself with twitch at all
so<00:03:41.919> I<00:03:41.950> think<00:03:42.099> that<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.730> know<00:03:42.849> dooms<00:03:43.180> better<00:03:43.510> in

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
so I think that you know dooms better in

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.059 
so I think that you know dooms better in
that<00:03:43.900> respect<00:03:44.410> where<00:03:44.650> we're<00:03:44.859> much<00:03:45.040> more

that respect where we're much more

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.069 
that respect where we're much more

from the you know the pieces that it was

from the you know the pieces that it was
put<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.389> because<00:04:13.989> we<00:04:14.560> left<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:16.090> know

let it go inactive and I think that that

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
was a mistake I think that's one of the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.469 
was a mistake I think that's one of the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
not saying this because YouTube's like a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.030 
not saying this because YouTube's like a
huge<00:04:31.389> part<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.810> my<00:04:31.930> life<00:04:31.960> I'm<00:04:32.380> more<00:04:32.590> saying<00:04:32.889> it

it throughout advanced warfare I think

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.840 
it throughout advanced warfare I think
that<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.979> know<00:05:39.070> we'd<00:05:39.340> be<00:05:39.370> in<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.700> different
