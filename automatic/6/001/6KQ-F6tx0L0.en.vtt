00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.359
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.720
 new video today i want you the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:17.310
 euro-club performance this is a 3 in 1 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:19.720
 objective for your iphone 4 versus 49 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.669
 if you buy the euro-club 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.289
 you get a tip from box 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.179
 you through a plastic window the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
 clip itself can already see and on 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.749
 that also has some info 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.880
 stand on it or test pictures pictured 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.860
 are found in the cardboard box itself 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.660
 her then a plastic packaging in the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.460
 He then once again a few 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.050
 note for the correct use of the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.810
 autoclubs a few warranty 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.310
 Descriptions blah blah blah and so on 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.440
 you know that a lot 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.510
 more interesting there is the next and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.490
 Although the alu clip itself was something to me 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.320
 this place would like to mention briefly 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.330
 is that the thing on me directly one 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.770
 who has made a stable impression 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.960
 continue to be held over the weeks 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.970
 because the part just super built 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.410
 is as a small bonus but also 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.570
 another small fabric says to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.260
 transport and two 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.809
 plastic covers for the lenses 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.420
 included the use of otto clip 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.310
 is really ultras simple you have to 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.530
 just part of your device over the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 Shinkan lens guilty of the whole 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.580
 fun is positive for me at this 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.710
 still noticed that the euro 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.600
 clip has a recess in the place 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.490
 where the song wait switch 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.690
 is that you during the use 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 do not frustrate your iphone 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.460
 off that would be perfect is 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.260
 the construction but not because 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.630
 if you have some thicker protective films on 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.520
 you could have installed your device 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.500
 To problems can be said 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.450
 But we do not have to come to the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.450
 different objective the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 at the same time suitable for everyday use 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.240
 most practical but also and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.280
 the most spectacular there is the white three 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 angel lens and the name is here 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.450
 Absolute program with her you get 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.369
 namely just more in your pictures 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.890
 as without and that can of course be in 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 innumerable situation be handy at 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.580
 take pictures of large buildings or 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 similar if you are in small 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.790
 is located and still plenty of 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.750
 want to get into the picture and so on 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.580
 on and on 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.980
 a whole corner extreme 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 that's the fisheye lens too 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.940
 Honestly my personal highlight 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 in the all clips with the thing you get 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.660
 not only really everything into the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.000
 bild but just get this 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.530
 brilliant round effect of the things 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 also lends its name to the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.370
 extreme vaults get in 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.630
 However, a black border in the picture 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.490
 On the one hand, you can of course now 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.440
 say the system effect even further 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.150
 helps but I feel that rather than 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.250
 a little disturbing there in pretty much 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.860
 It quickly stands out that the objective 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.110
 not centrally iphone on its 100% 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.670
 Camera is but if you are in the video 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.330
 mode changes disappear 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.860
 black edges mostly sometimes looks 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 you still get it on easily 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.840
 the right side does not ask me 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.520
 why that is so times but fact 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.680
 I am always stuck with the thing 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.450
 stop the iphone and get there 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 always different results though 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.770
 in the situation somehow does not matter because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.480
 the fisheye effect is so cool that you 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.550
 he one of those little negative points 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.320
 quickly forget the clip is a 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.390
 3 in 1 lens and we had now 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.700
 already two pages with two lenses 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.320
 but where is the third one hiding? 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.030
 is really pretty clever 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860
 because if you have the wide angle lens 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470
 unscrewed you get into the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.870
 Macromodus and he allows you completely 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.670
 very very very close to things up to be 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.060
 go and still focus on them 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.880
 to have 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.380
 and I really mean that very close 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.750
 you only have a few with the iphone 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.000
 millimeter away from the target is even 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.070
 so close that at ants already the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.260
 can recognize in scenes that is 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.390
 really not practical in any way 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.930
 But fashion makes an incredible amount 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.940
 fun 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.250
 But I'm a little bit negative 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.019
 also the strong vignette noticed there 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.940
 the pictures to the edge really really 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.230
 Blurred become an effect of the unfortunately 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.150
 also a little bit at the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.070
 fisheye lens occurs but who wants to 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.709
 The macro can if you have 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.959
 By the way, totally alienated and 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.239
 funny blurry pictures make bog 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.750
 Something similar we come to one 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.540
 final conclusion of the euro clip is 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 really 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.120
 Extremely cool part of it is there 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.430
 No doubt about all three lenses 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.219
 somehow so their special features the one 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.230
 learned for example is worthy only 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.060
 more practical things in the game 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.920
 wants to get in with family photos or 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.900
 I just know a great one 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.389
 Practical things in daily use 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.030
 ski marco lens therefore is not so 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.669
 practically but definitely a lot of fun 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.400
 with the experiment and me 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.080
 fischer one is just super cool 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.120
 I mean this fisherman, effect super 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.460
 suitable and somehow so skateboard 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.130
 or to make other sports videos or 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.720
 for music videos or something like that too 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.880
 just a fun fisherman thing 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.380
 on a photo it is easy around 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.210
 Rome 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.009
 cool thing actually the euro clips 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.900
 also pretty well built though 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.070
 it remembered as, of course, 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.440
 his weaknesses I had my strong 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.910
 vignette for example as that was not 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.889
 it is not quite as nice 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.190
 that the fishermen do not quite make sense 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.220
 In the middle, therefore, I am very central 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.780
 well not that great when you are 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.639
 a slide used on his walkway 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.830
 we can also do some smaller ones 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.770
 gets problems and it really is 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.409
 Well not that great where I am 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.210
 Now I can tell you 75 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.330
 you have to pay euro for the euro club 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.520
 lie down and 75 euros are my view 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.510
 at least a very difficult rate wherein 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.849
 I can not say 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.500
 75 euros that I can as low need 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.330
 to beat her because that would be somehow 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.810
 lied but it would also be a lie too 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.690
 say 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.190
 75 euro that is much too expensive 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.750
 how often no case for that 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.550
 most truth somehow like this 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.889
 I can only speak again 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.930
 glued in is a great thing though a lot 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.090
 fun to use it is also in 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.220
 very practical in many situations 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.680
 But time is also worth 75 euro 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.370
 I have to be here for myself 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.479
 decide 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.240
 there you can make the decision 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.130
 really lose weight so you have to 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.740
 simply know yourself the euro club 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.120
 By the way, there are black and red inside 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.490
 for the iphone 4 4 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.139
 and iphone 5, we can indeed times 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.120
 below in the video description at the 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.410
 drop by if you look for 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.300
 interested in this product and then 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.180
 you can continue to inform and 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.710
 Buy it if you feel like it 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.600
 At this point I would like me too 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.699
 again very sincerely with you 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.320
 for the audience once again thank you very much 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.070
 a lot of fun this video too 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.630
 to produce 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.550
 and if should be with the audience too 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.040
 was fun fell then yes what is too 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.790
 do is here with the like or the 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.199
 last day to know about how I 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.830
 I would definitely very, very 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.310
 looking forward 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.539
 or did I watch that with this video and 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.539
 Until next time
