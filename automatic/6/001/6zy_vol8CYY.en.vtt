00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
HD port and whether or not I think it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
HD port and whether or not I think it's
worth<00:01:03.989> picking<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> original

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
worth picking up over the original

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
worth picking up over the original

the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870 
the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions
it's<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.590> necessarily<00:01:41.100> drastically

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's not necessarily drastically

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.039 
it's not necessarily drastically
different<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.570> definitely<00:01:42.750> an

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
different but it's definitely an

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
different but it's definitely an
improvement<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.770> character<00:01:44.220> models<00:01:44.549> towns

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
improvement as character models towns

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.359 
improvement as character models towns
environments<00:01:45.750> menus<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> even<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> text

environments menus and even the text

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.719 
environments menus and even the text
itself<00:01:47.670> looks<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.570> improved<00:01:49.009> but<00:01:50.009> having

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
itself looks much improved but having

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
itself looks much improved but having
said<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> say<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.229> all

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
said that I can say that not all

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
treatment and most characters are really
not<00:01:56.310> plot<00:01:56.700> relevant<00:01:57.149> kinda<00:01:57.600> looks<00:01:57.810> subpar<00:01:58.320> as

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
GameCube version many times this reduced

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
GameCube version many times this reduced
framerate<00:02:50.310> took<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:51.000> getting<00:02:51.270> used<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
framerate took some getting used to and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.660 
framerate took some getting used to and
made<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> battles<00:02:52.410> feel<00:02:52.590> slower<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.340> bit

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
made the battles feel slower or a bit

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.360 
made the battles feel slower or a bit
more<00:02:53.880> sluggish<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.010> problem

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
more sluggish but I think this problem

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
more sluggish but I think this problem
only<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:57.090> applies<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.450> those<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.990> us<00:02:58.050> who

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
only really applies to those of us who

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.260 
only really applies to those of us who
are<00:02:58.350> used<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> original<00:02:59.340> release<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.060> this

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
are used to the original release if this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.090 
are used to the original release if this
is<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.510> first<00:03:00.720> time<00:03:00.960> playing<00:03:01.170> symphonia<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
is your first time playing symphonia I

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.130 
is your first time playing symphonia I
don't<00:03:02.520> think<00:03:02.790> you'll<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.120> notice<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.690> but

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
don't think you'll really notice it but

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.110 
don't think you'll really notice it but
it<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.440> something<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.920> keep<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.250> mind<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.790> as

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it is something to keep in mind and as

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.150 
it is something to keep in mind and as
such<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.690> makes<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.110> little<00:03:07.470> difficult<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.010> me

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
such it makes a little difficult for me

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.980 
such it makes a little difficult for me
to<00:03:08.280> call<00:03:08.460> tail<00:03:08.670> symphonia<00:03:09.150> Chronicles<00:03:09.720> that's

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
to call tail symphonia Chronicles that's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.390 
to call tail symphonia Chronicles that's
a<00:03:10.080> defender<00:03:10.500> version<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.130> game

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
a defender version of this game

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.510 
a defender version of this game
regardless<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:13.020> still<00:03:13.080> think<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.770> version<00:03:14.130> is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
regardless I still think this version is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.010 
regardless I still think this version is
still<00:03:14.790> worth<00:03:15.000> picking<00:03:15.270> up<00:03:15.570> whether<00:03:15.810> you've

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
still worth picking up whether you've

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.780 
still worth picking up whether you've
played<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> original<00:03:16.500> dozens<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.550> times

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
played the original dozens of times

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.310 
played the original dozens of times
where<00:03:18.090> you've<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.240> gotten<00:03:18.840> into<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.140> tale

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320

where you've just gotten into the tale
series<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.860> believe<00:03:20.340> tales<00:03:20.610> symphonia<00:03:21.150> HD<00:03:21.540> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
series I believe tales symphonia HD is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.030 
series I believe tales symphonia HD is
worth<00:03:21.900> playing<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.260> anyone<00:03:22.440> who's<00:03:22.830> either

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
worth playing for anyone who's either

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.010 
worth playing for anyone who's either
experienced<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.700> before<00:03:23.850> or<00:03:24.240> who<00:03:24.510> hasn't
