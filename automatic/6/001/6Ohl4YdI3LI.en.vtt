 how are you I'm here another day and 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.610
 I come here we have a new tweet the tweet of 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.920
 today is audio record ehr that serves to 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 record the calls we make and that 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.510
 they make us then good this is a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.510
 very practical tweet because there is no other 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.450
 way that we can record the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.740
 calls unless we have cydia 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.690
 then well let's install it and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.320
 then I explain how it works first 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.830

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.260

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.339
 add and write the address and you 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.390
 let's add source to the address 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 that we have to put is http colon 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.530
 repo dot hacker iphone dot org 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.399

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.399

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.100
 to modify because I have installed 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.259
 an icon here as you see here below and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.179
 appears and then it will be 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.399
 configured to be able to use it 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.039
