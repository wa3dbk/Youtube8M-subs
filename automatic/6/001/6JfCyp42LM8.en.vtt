00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the water we can see that the chlorine

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.200 
the water we can see that the chlorine
level<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.770> exactly<00:02:53.430> where<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.850> supposed<00:02:53.910> to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
level is exactly where it's supposed to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.180 
level is exactly where it's supposed to
be<00:02:54.270> right<00:02:54.690> around<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.050> point<00:02:55.290> five<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.160> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
be right around that point five so I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.580 
be right around that point five so I
have<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.610> seek<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.260> shake

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
have to seek right here and if I shake

global<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.790> here<00:03:08.420> even<00:03:09.420> easier<00:03:09.810> than

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
global right here even easier than

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.470 
global right here even easier than
