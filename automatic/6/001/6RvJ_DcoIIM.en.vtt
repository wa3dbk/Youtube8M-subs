negative 22 82 you'll see a series of
boxes<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.540> large<00:01:03.809> pipe<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
boxes and then this large pipe on the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.320 
boxes and then this large pipe on the
wall<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.770> you're<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.670> jump<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:06.120> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
wall and you're just going to jump on to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
wall and you're just going to jump on to
it<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.570> run<00:01:07.080> along<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.410> pipe<00:01:07.620> this<00:01:08.370> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it and run along the pipe this is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
it and run along the pipe this is
actually<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> easiest<00:01:09.840> ones<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
actually one of the easiest ones to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
actually one of the easiest ones to
reach<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.920> course<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.060> does<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
reach in course it as all it does is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
reach in course it as all it does is
require<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.200> minor<00:01:13.560> jumps<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> walking

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
require just minor jumps and walking

00:01:14.970 --> 00:02:15.540 
require just minor jumps and walking
along<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> pipes

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.160 

getting<00:02:16.210> down<00:02:16.420> from<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.990> be<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> little

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
getting down from here can be a little

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.310 
getting down from here can be a little
bit<00:02:17.500> tricky<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.220> after<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.700> data<00:02:18.910> cron

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
bit tricky so after the data cron

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.480 
bit tricky so after the data cron
cutscene<00:02:20.320> here<00:02:20.590> I'll<00:02:20.800> show<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.130> how<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
cutscene here I'll show you how to get

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:40.429 
cutscene here I'll show you how to get
down

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.539 

after<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.530> cut-scene<00:02:41.769> you're<00:02:42.189> going<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.370> go

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
after the cut-scene you're going to go

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.780 
after the cut-scene you're going to go
between<00:02:42.909> these<00:02:43.090> two<00:02:43.299> pipes<00:02:44.340> walk<00:02:45.340> along<00:02:45.609> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
between these two pipes walk along the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
between these two pipes walk along the
edge<00:02:45.819> here<00:02:46.329> then<00:02:46.810> go<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.349> left<00:02:47.560> you'll<00:02:47.950> see

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
edge here then go to the left you'll see

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.770 
edge here then go to the left you'll see
look<00:02:48.370> down<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.790> see<00:02:48.939> a<00:02:48.969> pipe<00:02:49.269> you'll<00:02:49.569> just

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
look down and see a pipe you'll just

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.420 
look down and see a pipe you'll just
drop<00:02:50.079> down<00:02:50.260> onto<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:50.980> make<00:02:51.189> sure

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
drop down onto that and then make sure

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.020 
drop down onto that and then make sure
to<00:02:51.579> drop<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.180> four<00:02:52.510> below<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.379> jump

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to drop to the four below do not jump

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.099 
to drop to the four below do not jump
