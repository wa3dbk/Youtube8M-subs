00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
fingerprints and stuff on the side which

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.050 
fingerprints and stuff on the side which
I<00:00:26.800> really<00:00:27.099> don't<00:00:27.160> care<00:00:27.399> about<00:00:27.460> because<00:00:27.849> I<00:00:27.910> just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
I really don't care about because I just

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.479 
I really don't care about because I just
took<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.329> off<00:00:28.480> my<00:00:28.509> macbook<00:00:29.110> and<00:00:29.860> it<00:00:30.040> was<00:00:30.130> fairly

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
took it off my macbook and it was fairly

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.580 
took it off my macbook and it was fairly
simple<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.029> take<00:00:31.210> off<00:00:31.450> now<00:00:31.869> I'm<00:00:31.930> going<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.110> put

simple to take off now I'm going to put

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.630 
simple to take off now I'm going to put

it on for you and show you guys how easy

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.069 
it on for you and show you guys how easy
hard<00:00:36.640> whatever<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.360> want<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.570> call<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.930> it's

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
hard whatever you want to call it it's

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.049 
hard whatever you want to call it it's
not<00:00:38.170> really<00:00:38.350> hard<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.679> put<00:00:38.829> on<00:00:38.980> it's<00:00:39.879> pretty

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
not really hard to put on it's pretty

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.889 
not really hard to put on it's pretty
straightforward

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
straightforward

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.290 
straightforward
so<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.710> hinge<00:00:41.890> right<00:00:42.070> there<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.489> obviously

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
so that hinge right there is obviously

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.599 
so that hinge right there is obviously
for<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:43.600> front<00:00:43.899> so<00:00:44.769> I'm<00:00:44.890> going<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.100> set<00:00:45.489> it

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
for the front so I'm going to set it

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.040 
for the front so I'm going to set it
right<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:46.030> there<00:00:48.149> there's<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.239> couple<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.629> snaps

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
right in there there's a couple of snaps

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.579 
right in there there's a couple of snaps
it<00:00:50.469> has<00:00:50.589> to<00:00:50.800> go<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:52.769> there's<00:00:53.769> one<00:00:54.070> there's<00:00:54.429> two

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
it has to go in there's one there's two

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.959 
it has to go in there's one there's two
so<00:00:56.589> there's<00:00:56.739> two<00:00:56.980> here<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.820> then<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.210> here<00:00:59.969> so

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
so there's two here and then to here so

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.430 
so there's two here and then to here so
yeah<00:01:01.149> that's<00:01:01.359> that's<00:01:01.749> pretty<00:01:01.960> much<00:01:02.140> all<00:01:02.320> right

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
yeah that's that's pretty much all right

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.009 
yeah that's that's pretty much all right

can<00:01:05.199> see<00:01:05.379> right<00:01:05.590> there<00:01:05.860> none<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.850> back<00:01:07.050> all

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
right now I'm going to put it on the top

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.050 
right now I'm going to put it on the top
part<00:01:11.079> now<00:01:11.229> now<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.040> this<00:01:12.220> it<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.610> kind<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.880> I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
part now now on this it was kind of I

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.520 
part now now on this it was kind of I
wasn't<00:01:13.329> really<00:01:13.450> sure<00:01:13.689> how<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.899> put<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.259> but

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
wasn't really sure how to put it on but

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.940 
wasn't really sure how to put it on but
if<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:15.159> can<00:01:15.310> see<00:01:15.729> there's<00:01:16.329> like<00:01:16.720> three<00:01:17.079> boxes

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
if you can see there's like three boxes

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.050 
if you can see there's like three boxes
right<00:01:18.130> there<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.460> there's<00:01:18.610> two<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:18.939> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
right there and there's two on the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.679 
right there and there's two on the
bottom<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.960> three<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.439> on<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.680> top<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.689> it's

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
bottom the three go on the top and it's

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.120 
bottom the three go on the top and it's
pretty<00:01:22.960> easy<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.259> put<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.860> was<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.040> little

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
pretty easy to put in it was a little

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.370 
pretty easy to put in it was a little
harder<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.299> don't<00:01:25.450> have<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.659> put<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.869> lot<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
harder you don't have to put a lot of

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.249 
harder you don't have to put a lot of
pressure<00:01:26.530> into<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.130> but<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:28.509> gets<00:01:28.689> on<00:01:28.930> pretty

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
pressure into it but it gets on pretty

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.090 
pressure into it but it gets on pretty
easily<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.729> think<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:31.560> yeah<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:32.920> on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
easily like I think it's yeah it's on

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.190 
easily like I think it's yeah it's on
now<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.680> that's<00:01:35.979> that's<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.210> what<00:01:38.170> I

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
now so that's that's it and then what I

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.139 
now so that's that's it and then what I
wanted<00:01:38.530> with<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.860> one<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.250> wanted<00:01:39.579> one<00:01:39.789> where

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
wanted with this one I wanted one where

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.420 
wanted with this one I wanted one where
you<00:01:40.299> could<00:01:40.509> see<00:01:41.110> through<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.039> can<00:01:42.219> see

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
you could see through it so you can see

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.310 
you could see through it so you can see
the<00:01:42.549> Apple<00:01:42.909> logo<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.479> back<00:01:43.630> actually<00:01:44.259> I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
the Apple logo on the back actually I

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.690 
the Apple logo on the back actually I
don't<00:01:44.380> think<00:01:44.500> this<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.039> way<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.490> wanted

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
don't think this is in a way so I wanted

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.920 
don't think this is in a way so I wanted
when<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:48.939> can<00:01:49.149> see<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.359> Apple<00:01:49.600> logo<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.869> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
when we can see the Apple logo on the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.599 
when we can see the Apple logo on the
back<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.439> one<00:01:50.619> does<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.890> great<00:01:51.189> job<00:01:51.250> of

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
back and this one does a great job of

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.819 
back and this one does a great job of
that<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.079> even<00:01:53.079> if<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.259> turn<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.560> brightness

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
that and even if you turn the brightness

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.020 
that and even if you turn the brightness
up<00:01:54.280> all<00:01:54.520> right<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.570> see<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.810> even<00:01:56.020> better

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
up all right you can see it even better

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.550 
up all right you can see it even better
so<00:01:58.030> shines<00:01:58.329> way<00:01:58.570> better<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.439> because

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
so shines way better I like this because

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.440 
so shines way better I like this because
then<00:01:59.770> looks<00:02:00.009> like<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.219> have<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.369> black<00:02:00.729> MacBook

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
then looks like you have a black MacBook

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.380 
then looks like you have a black MacBook
Air<00:02:01.719> which<00:02:02.140> they<00:02:02.380> don't<00:02:02.500> even<00:02:02.679> make<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:04.210> that's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
Air which they don't even make so that's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.060 
Air which they don't even make so that's
really<00:02:04.719> really<00:02:04.990> cool<00:02:05.289> which<00:02:06.219> I<00:02:06.399> like<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.609> lot<00:02:08.070> so

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.900 
also this is a high density silicone
case<00:02:10.990> which<00:02:11.200> makes<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.560> feel<00:02:11.740> really<00:02:12.010> soft<00:02:12.490> and
