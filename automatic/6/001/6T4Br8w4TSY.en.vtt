00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.870 
expensive because each pack is anywhere
from<00:04:24.139> three<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.590> four<00:04:24.860> dollars<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> pact<00:04:25.520> right

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
from three to four dollars a pact right

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.390 
from three to four dollars a pact right
so<00:04:26.360> you<00:04:26.419> have<00:04:26.690> 36<00:04:27.260> packs<00:04:27.530> per<00:04:27.800> box<00:04:28.040> you're

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
so you have 36 packs per box you're

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.340 
so you have 36 packs per box you're
talking<00:04:29.120> over<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:29.360> hundred<00:04:29.479> dollars<00:04:29.990> gotcha

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350
