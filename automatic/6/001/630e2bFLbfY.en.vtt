used<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.219> quill<00:00:48.489> pen<00:00:48.519> made<00:00:49.149> of<00:00:49.269> an<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.510> bird

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
used a quill pen made of an a bird

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.939 
feather or animal hairbrush and they
would<00:00:53.199> have<00:00:54.420> probably<00:00:55.420> used<00:00:55.870> different<00:00:56.469> sizes

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
would have probably used different sizes

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.739 
would have probably used different sizes
of<00:00:56.980> pens<00:00:57.309> for<00:00:57.579> different<00:00:57.910> sizes<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.329> strokes

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
of pens for different sizes of strokes

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.720 
of pens for different sizes of strokes
with<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.649> brush<00:00:59.949> you<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:00.249> actually<00:01:00.399> make<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
with a brush you can actually make a

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.880 
with a brush you can actually make a
heavy<00:01:00.999> stroke<00:01:01.390> by<00:01:01.600> pressing<00:01:01.989> harder<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.469> a

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
heavy stroke by pressing harder and a

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.680 
heavy stroke by pressing harder and a
lighter<00:01:03.070> stroke<00:01:03.370> by<00:01:03.550> by<00:01:03.879> lighter<00:01:04.120> touch<00:01:04.390> but

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
lighter stroke by by lighter touch but

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.370 
lighter stroke by by lighter touch but
it's<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:05.370> quite<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.400> skill<00:01:06.730> to<00:01:06.880> develop<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.420> I

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
it's a quite a skill to develop and I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's a quite a skill to develop and I
find<00:01:08.620> it<00:01:08.680> simpler<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.040> use<00:01:09.100> these<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.600> will

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
find it simpler to use these so I will

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.630 
find it simpler to use these so I will
demonstrate<00:01:11.140> by<00:01:11.710> writing<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.130> name<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.520> my
