he<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.620> picked<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.010> up<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> pre-war

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
he first picked it up this is a pre-war

some modifications to this frame like I
say<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:25.230> rough<00:00:25.470> shape<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
say it was in very rough shape when I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.540 
say it was in very rough shape when I
first<00:00:27.300> started<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> project<00:00:28.189> if<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> check

caught<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.950> at

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.619

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the seat mask is kind of the turning

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.889 
the seat mask is kind of the turning
point<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.559> bike<00:00:44.300> at<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.480> point<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> time

something and as a result there's a dent

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.689 
something and as a result there's a dent
in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> seat<00:00:57.960> mast<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.469> actually<00:00:58.920> lightly

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
in the seat mast which actually lightly

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.619 
in the seat mast which actually lightly
bent<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.420> seat<00:01:00.660> mat<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> lot<00:01:03.239> easier<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
bent the seat mat it's a lot easier to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
bent the seat mat it's a lot easier to
see<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.080> person<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.830> putting<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
see in person when you're putting it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120 
see in person when you're putting it
under<00:01:06.119> close<00:01:06.390> scrutiny<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> something

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
under close scrutiny but it is something

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.450 
under close scrutiny but it is something
that<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.549> easily<00:01:09.799> unnoticed<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.040> you're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that can be easily unnoticed if you're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.270 
that can be easily unnoticed if you're
not<00:01:11.610> directly<00:01:12.090> looking<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.950> because

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
not directly looking for it but because

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.899 
not directly looking for it but because
that<00:01:14.310> seat<00:01:14.820> mast<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.750> damaged<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.759> felt<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that seat mast was damaged I felt that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
that seat mast was damaged I felt that
it<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.180> okay<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.750> ahead<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.380> some<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it was okay to go ahead and do some of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
it was okay to go ahead and do some of
the<00:01:19.770> modifications<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> frame<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the modifications to the frame that I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.170 
the modifications to the frame that I
wanted<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.229> done<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:23.759> these<00:01:23.970> aren't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
wanted to see done now these aren't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
wanted to see done now these aren't
modifications<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.200> recommend<00:01:25.680> doing<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
modifications I would recommend doing to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
modifications I would recommend doing to
just<00:01:26.340> any<00:01:26.490> frame<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
just any frame just because what like I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.120 
just any frame just because what like I
say<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.750> frame<00:01:31.079> had<00:01:31.439> some

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
say because this this frame had some

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
say because this this frame had some
serious<00:01:32.549> damage<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
serious damage it was kind of at a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.830 
serious damage it was kind of at a
turning<00:01:34.079> point<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.920> okay<00:01:35.700> it's

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
turning point that it's like okay it's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
turning point that it's like okay it's
justifiable<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:38.009> recommend<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.579> go

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
justifiable I don't recommend people go

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
justifiable I don't recommend people go
ahead<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> start<00:01:39.420> doing<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> mods

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

ahead and start doing some of the mods
I've<00:01:41.159> done<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> sake<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> doing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
I've done just for the sake of doing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.680 
I've done just for the sake of doing
them<00:01:43.229> though<00:01:43.409> I'd<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> clear<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
them though I'd like to be clear on that

I<00:01:45.750> guess<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.160> bike<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.520> what

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I guess you know it's your bike do what

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
I guess you know it's your bike do what
you<00:01:47.730> want<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.120> it<00:01:48.150> but<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:49.650> know<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.830> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you want with it but you know when it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.440 
you want with it but you know when it
comes<00:01:50.010> to<00:01:50.190> pre-war<00:01:50.400> metal<00:01:50.910> it's<00:01:51.030> pretty<00:01:51.240> rare

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
comes to pre-war metal it's pretty rare

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.670 
comes to pre-war metal it's pretty rare
so<00:01:51.830> but<00:01:52.830> what<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.980> had<00:01:53.190> done<00:01:53.370> is<00:01:53.570> shave<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.290> top

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
was completely crushed

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.310 
was completely crushed
so<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.670> cut<00:02:08.880> out<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.300> replaced<00:02:10.170> with

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
so that was cut out and replaced with

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.490 
so that was cut out and replaced with
this<00:02:10.590> fender<00:02:10.979> arch<00:02:11.160> which<00:02:11.460> also<00:02:11.700> has<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
this fender arch which also has a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450 
this fender arch which also has a
mounting<00:02:13.910> position<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> break<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.460> because

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
mounting position for a break so because

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.100 
mounting position for a break so because
of<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.670> rear<00:02:17.850> frame<00:02:18.150> spacing<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.930> could

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
of the rear frame spacing one could

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.290 
of the rear frame spacing one could
easily<00:02:19.320> convert<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.270> a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
easily convert this to it to a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.240 
easily convert this to it to a
three-speed<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:22.350> they<00:02:22.560> wanted<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> because

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
three-speed if they wanted to because

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.310 
three-speed if they wanted to because
now<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> brake<00:02:24.240> mount<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:25.110> that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
now you have the brake mount there that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.650 
now you have the brake mount there that
you<00:02:25.410> never<00:02:25.530> had<00:02:25.800> before<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.480> rear

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you never had before and the rear

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.690 
you never had before and the rear
spacing<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.350> correct<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.890> able<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.250> put<00:02:29.610> in

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
spacing is correct to be able to put in

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
spacing is correct to be able to put in
a<00:02:29.820> sturdy<00:02:30.090> three-speed<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> that's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
a sturdy three-speed in there so that's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.100 
a sturdy three-speed in there so that's
that's<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.940> neat<00:02:33.150> gateway<00:02:33.600> opener

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that's kind of a neat gateway opener

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
that's kind of a neat gateway opener
that<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.590> without<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.700> brake<00:02:35.940> mounted

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that you know without the brake mounted

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.940 
that you know without the brake mounted
you<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.290> you'd<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.530> stuck<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.890> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you know you'd be stuck with a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.290 
you know you'd be stuck with a
three-speed<00:02:38.190> coaster<00:02:38.700> would<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.060> only

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
three-speed coaster would be your only

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.000 
three-speed coaster would be your only
option<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.700> frame<00:02:41.940> actually<00:02:42.180> had<00:02:42.740> had<00:02:43.740> three

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
option this frame actually had had three

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.230 
option this frame actually had had three
cracks<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
cracks in it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.640 
cracks in it
the<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> had<00:02:47.160> pointed<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.640> here<00:02:48.150> before<00:02:48.650> as

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the one I had pointed out here before as

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.210 
the one I had pointed out here before as
you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.950> see<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:51.260> did<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> repair<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:53.010> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you can see I did a repair on all that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.390 
you can see I did a repair on all that
I've<00:02:53.640> been<00:02:53.880> welding<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.450> long<00:02:54.630> time<00:02:55.070> but<00:02:56.070> there

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
I've been welding a long time but there

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.979 
I've been welding a long time but there
was<00:02:56.550> actually<00:02:56.700> two<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.209> went<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.480> notice<00:02:57.840> in

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
was actually two that went on notice in

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.100 
was actually two that went on notice in
a<00:02:58.080> previous<00:02:58.500> video<00:02:58.650> right<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.310> on<00:03:00.110> each

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
a previous video right here on each

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.229 
a previous video right here on each
chain<00:03:01.530> stay<00:03:01.860> those<00:03:02.670> were<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.850> little<00:03:03.030> more

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
chain stay those were a little more

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.630 
chain stay those were a little more
difficult<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.340> repair

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
difficult to to get in and repair

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.220 
difficult to to get in and repair
because<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.420> know<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.720> tighter

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
because you know it's it's tighter

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.680 
because you know it's it's tighter
quarters<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.220> than<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.910> than<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.450> in

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
this large opening of the front half the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.910 
this large opening of the front half the
frame<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:12.570> uh<00:03:12.600> you'll<00:03:13.140> also<00:03:13.290> notice<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.739> I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
frame but uh you'll also notice that I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.880 
frame but uh you'll also notice that I
welded<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> chain<00:03:14.640> guard<00:03:14.820> tab<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.680> welded

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
welded on a chain guard tab and I welded

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.199 
welded on a chain guard tab and I welded
on<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> break<00:03:18.709> armature<00:03:19.709> tab<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.910> did<00:03:21.090> this

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
on a break armature tab and I did this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.120 
on a break armature tab and I did this
because<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.630> get<00:03:21.690> sick<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.050> those<00:03:22.170> loops<00:03:22.530> you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
because I get sick of those loops you

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.100 
because I get sick of those loops you
know<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.310> put<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.640> loop<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.060> there<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.570> hey

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
know you put that loop on there and hey

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.479 
know you put that loop on there and hey
that's<00:03:25.320> great<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> first<00:03:25.800> time<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.190> set<00:03:26.370> up

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
that's great the first time you set up

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.770 
that's great the first time you set up
the<00:03:26.580> bike<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.150> later<00:03:27.330> down<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.690> road

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the bike but then later down the road

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.449 
the bike but then later down the road
you<00:03:28.050> go<00:03:28.140> ahead<00:03:28.260> change<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.769> flat<00:03:28.890> or<00:03:29.160> something

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
you go ahead change a flat or something

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.729 
you go ahead change a flat or something
and<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.239> know<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.480> end<00:03:30.630> up<00:03:30.780> having<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.560> wheel

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and you know you end up having the wheel

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.140 
and you know you end up having the wheel
in<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.040> slightly<00:03:32.280> different<00:03:32.489> position<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
in a slightly different position and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.580 
in a slightly different position and
what<00:03:33.300> do<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.450> got<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> scratched<00:03:34.050> up<00:03:34.290> chain

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
what do you got a scratched up chain

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.910 
what do you got a scratched up chain
stay<00:03:34.920> from<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.340> loop<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.560> welded<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.590> tab

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
stay from that loop so I welded that tab

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.699 
stay from that loop so I welded that tab
on<00:03:38.160> there<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.550> then<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> cut<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> short<00:03:39.900> linkage

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
on there and then I cut a short linkage

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.850 
on there and then I cut a short linkage
rod<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.930> that's<00:03:43.200> pretty<00:03:43.440> much<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.800> i

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
rod and that that's pretty much it i

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.500 
rod and that that's pretty much it i
welded<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> nuts<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> backside<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.330> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
welded the nuts to the backside of that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.470 
welded the nuts to the backside of that
linkage<00:03:45.840> rod<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.500> way<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.480> only

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
linkage rod so that way I can just only

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.420 
linkage rod so that way I can just only
need<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.200> screwdriver<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.980> have<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> hold

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
need the screwdriver and I have to hold

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.650 
need the screwdriver and I have to hold
the<00:03:50.550> wrench<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:51.000> nothing<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.390> see<00:03:51.570> the

the wrench or nothing you see the
backside<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.110> there<00:03:53.150> you'll<00:03:54.150> also<00:03:54.330> notice

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
backside of there you'll also notice

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.620 
backside of there you'll also notice
that<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.930> welded<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:56.120> fender<00:03:57.120> tabs<00:03:57.360> here

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
that I welded on these fender tabs here

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.450 
that I welded on these fender tabs here
they<00:03:58.110> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.410> create<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:58.740> bit<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.130> a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
they kind of create a little bit of a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.240 
they kind of create a little bit of a
and<00:03:59.550> effect<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.990> wanted<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.100> little

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and effect and I wanted to go a little

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.640 
and effect and I wanted to go a little
larger<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:02.880> because<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.140> length<00:04:04.350> of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
larger but because of the the length of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.450 
larger but because of the the length of
the<00:04:05.360> defender<00:04:06.360> arch<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:07.590> was<00:04:07.740> about<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.040> is

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
the defender arch that was about it is

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.520 
the defender arch that was about it is
large<00:04:08.820> as<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.240> could<00:04:09.630> go<00:04:09.780> without<00:04:10.080> having<00:04:10.290> to

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
large as I could go without having to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.300 
large as I could go without having to
alter<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.890> fender<00:04:11.220> arch<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:12.500> like<00:04:13.500> those<00:04:13.680> fins<00:04:14.040> in

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
alter a fender arch I like those fins in

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.680 
alter a fender arch I like those fins in
that<00:04:14.490> they<00:04:14.610> add<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:15.090> bit<00:04:15.210> of<00:04:15.300> balance<00:04:15.450> to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that they add a little bit of balance to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.670 
that they add a little bit of balance to
the<00:04:15.960> frontward<00:04:16.470> finning<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.970> spork

the frontward finning of the spork
before<00:04:19.680> turned<00:04:19.980> out<00:04:20.100> pretty<00:04:20.250> good<00:04:20.489> it's

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
before turned out pretty good it's

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.770 
before turned out pretty good it's
traveling<00:04:21.750> very<00:04:22.410> well<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:24.150> was<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.540> was<00:04:24.630> quite

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
traveling very well it was it was quite

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.480 
traveling very well it was it was quite
a<00:04:24.900> difficult<00:04:25.140> thing<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.680> get<00:04:25.830> back<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.250> track

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
a difficult thing to get back on track

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.880 
a difficult thing to get back on track
there's<00:04:27.300> there's<00:04:27.810> actually<00:04:28.170> guide<00:04:28.410> slides

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
there's there's actually guide slides

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.040 
there's there's actually guide slides
that<00:04:29.670> would<00:04:29.850> originally<00:04:30.330> go<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.630> those<00:04:30.780> slots

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
that would originally go in those slots

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.490 
that would originally go in those slots
that<00:04:31.470> didn't<00:04:32.190> come<00:04:32.340> with<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.550> fork<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.510> had

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
that didn't come with the fork so I had

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.320 
that didn't come with the fork so I had
to<00:04:34.590> look<00:04:34.710> into<00:04:34.860> doing<00:04:35.310> some<00:04:35.670> other<00:04:35.790> options

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
to look into doing some other options

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.510 
to look into doing some other options
and<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.810> came<00:04:37.500> up<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.860> pretty<00:04:38.070> good<00:04:38.310> system

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
and I came up with a pretty good system

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.360 
and I came up with a pretty good system
here<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.030> uses<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:40.470> nylon<00:04:40.890> bushing

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
here that uses some nylon bushing

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.210 
here that uses some nylon bushing
washers<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.480> slide<00:04:42.780> as<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.440> slide<00:04:43.680> surface

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
washers to slide as the slide surface

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.700 
washers to slide as the slide surface
you<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.910> see<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.210> large<00:04:45.390> nylon<00:04:45.900> washer<00:04:46.410> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
you can see the large nylon washer the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.540 
you can see the large nylon washer the
white<00:04:46.890> disc<00:04:47.460> right<00:04:47.760> there<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:50.370> keeps

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
white disc right there that keeps

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.630 
white disc right there that keeps
everything<00:04:51.680> sliding<00:04:52.680> smooth<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.430> those

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
everything sliding smooth and those

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.490 
everything sliding smooth and those
pieces<00:04:53.940> are<00:04:54.240> fully<00:04:54.480> replaceable<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.350> when

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
pieces are fully replaceable so when

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.410 
pieces are fully replaceable so when
they<00:04:55.620> wear<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:56.250> ditch<00:04:56.430> them<00:04:56.610> pick<00:04:57.060> up<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.300> new

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
they wear just ditch them pick up a new

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.420 
they wear just ditch them pick up a new
new<00:04:58.050> nylon<00:04:58.410> washer<00:04:58.830> at<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.070> hardware<00:04:59.370> store

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
new nylon washer at the hardware store

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.520 
new nylon washer at the hardware store
and<00:04:59.790> slap<00:04:59.970> them<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.270> there<00:05:00.480> you'll<00:05:01.200> notice

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
and slap them on there you'll notice

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.920 
and slap them on there you'll notice
that<00:05:01.740> my<00:05:02.550> bottoms<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.330> my<00:05:03.450> fork<00:05:04.070> unbolt<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.930> it

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
that my bottoms of my fork unbolt and it

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.720 
that my bottoms of my fork unbolt and it
just<00:05:07.530> makes<00:05:07.680> more<00:05:07.890> sense<00:05:08.220> than<00:05:08.310> trying<00:05:08.640> to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
just makes more sense than trying to

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.640 
just makes more sense than trying to
spread<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.240> fork<00:05:09.570> legs<00:05:09.810> apart<00:05:10.140> like<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
spread the fork legs apart like the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.650 
spread the fork legs apart like the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
comparison I just I just did what I had

kind<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.240> did<00:05:30.360> my<00:05:30.389> own<00:05:30.660> thing<00:05:30.720> there<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.319> also

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
kind of did my own thing there I also

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.460 
kind of did my own thing there I also
added<00:05:32.340> this<00:05:32.460> distrust<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.629> fork<00:05:33.900> they<00:05:34.289> did

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
added this distrust to the fork they did

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.409 
added this distrust to the fork they did
have<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.949> truss<00:05:35.280> on<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.610> front<00:05:35.849> originally

have a truss on the front originally

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.110 
have a truss on the front originally
that<00:05:36.990> isn't<00:05:37.379> the<00:05:37.470> correct<00:05:37.680> trust<00:05:38.099> it

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
that isn't the correct trust it

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.490 
that isn't the correct trust it
it's<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.900> Schwinn<00:05:40.139> trust<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:40.830> extended<00:05:41.490> the

it's a Schwinn trust that I extended the
