 the super killed joy of the way that is the pedal 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:12.900
 but I would have liked to have a lot of pedal 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 it's a super mental even 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.909

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.570

 good people to be very easy to 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.040
 Wake me, I will not let go to you. 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040
 to feel 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.220
 or severe 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.200
 the medium 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180
 proud 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.840
 You can see that there are many 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.950
 combinations you can make with this 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.070
 pedal 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.440
 so it's very simple, I'll show you 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.560
 for you a sound that is used a lot in 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.300
 metal that is a good excuse or sound 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.300
 with very few means 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.109
 I am 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:35.140
 and more regulation dictates to him or 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.140
 solo then with a fair average 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.830

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:21.870
 submit the lightning bolts and a pedal 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.770
 works very well in combination with a 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.449
 piece of buster before and with several 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.599
 other metals such as laws or 6 to 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:37.499
 two modulations of the general form very 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:39.539
 cool and very heavy to enjoy and 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.960
