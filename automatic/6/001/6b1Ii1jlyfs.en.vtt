good probably going just over the run a
ball<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.700> would<00:00:47.879> assume<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.750> can't<00:00:49.410> really

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the game for our team after coming in

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.190 
the game for our team after coming in
with<00:01:06.750> two<00:01:07.260> overs<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.100> 12<00:01:08.729> runs<00:01:09.119> 12<00:01:09.840> balls<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.020 
with two overs to go 12 runs 12 balls to
go<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.700> 36<00:01:11.700> runs<00:01:11.880> required<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> very

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
go and 36 runs required so it was a very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
go and 36 runs required so it was a very
very<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.330> performance<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:17.100> us<00:01:17.189> over<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
very good performance to get us over the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
very good performance to get us over the
line<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.960> our<00:01:18.990> first<00:01:19.320> match<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
line there so when our first match the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.980 
line there so when our first match the
stars<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.090> good<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.900> gonna

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
stars are pretty good I think it's gonna

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.249 
stars are pretty good I think it's gonna
be<00:01:22.110> tough<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.470> beat<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.570> let's<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.229> if

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
be tough to beat them but let's see if

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.700 
be tough to beat them but let's see if
we<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.659> I'd<00:01:27.659> probably<00:01:28.259> need<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
we can do it here I'd probably need to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.789 
we can do it here I'd probably need to
take<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.159> three<00:01:29.670> wickets<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:31.439> suspect

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
take about three wickets I would suspect

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
take about three wickets I would suspect
I<00:01:32.490> can't<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.570> remember<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.960> happened<00:01:34.259> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
