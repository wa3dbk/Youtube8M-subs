hello<00:00:03.330> Internet<00:00:03.810> today<00:00:04.680> I'm<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.980> be

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hello Internet today I'm going to be

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.700 
hello Internet today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.580> different<00:00:05.730> kind<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.270> video

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
showing you a different kind of video

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
showing you a different kind of video
I'm<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.040> showing<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
I'm going to be showing you a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.060 
I'm going to be showing you a
lock-picking<00:00:09.059> technique<00:00:09.870> called<00:00:10.530> raking

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
lock-picking technique called raking

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
lock-picking technique called raking
that<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.730> find<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.179> much<00:00:12.509> more<00:00:12.690> practical

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that I find to be much more practical

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.620 
that I find to be much more practical
and<00:00:13.500> then<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> traditional<00:00:14.160> picking<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.700> mean

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and then a traditional picking I mean

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.140 
and then a traditional picking I mean
when<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.809> traditionally<00:00:16.379> pick<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> lock<00:00:16.890> on

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
when you traditionally pick a lock on

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.300 
when you traditionally pick a lock on
every<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.300> pen<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:19.050> tumbler<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
every little pen or tumbler in it you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.040 
every little pen or tumbler in it you
have<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.609> individually<00:00:21.240> push<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
have to individually push up in the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.679 
have to individually push up in the
proper<00:00:22.260> order<00:00:22.560> now<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.029> advantage<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
proper order now the advantage to that

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.599 
proper order now the advantage to that
would<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> pretty

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
would be that you can do that to pretty

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
would be that you can do that to pretty
much<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> tumbler<00:00:27.750> lock<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.890> any

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
much any kind of tumbler lock like any

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.720 
much any kind of tumbler lock like any
lock<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.609> may<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.090> harder<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
lock it may be harder but you can do it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
lock it may be harder but you can do it
to<00:00:32.820> any<00:00:32.969> lock<00:00:33.180> pretty<00:00:33.420> much<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> other

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to any lock pretty much that the other

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.790 
to any lock pretty much that the other
method<00:00:35.370> called<00:00:36.059> raking<00:00:36.540> well<00:00:37.380> by<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
method called raking well by other I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
method called raking well by other I
mean<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> other<00:00:38.250> popular<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.420> sure<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
mean the other popular one I'm sure you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.880 
mean the other popular one I'm sure you
can<00:00:40.410> find<00:00:40.559> another<00:00:40.829> method<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.520> where<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
can find another method but where you

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.080 
can find another method but where you
you<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.129> need<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.850> what

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you don't really need to know what

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
you don't really need to know what
you're<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.329> very<00:00:45.899> much<00:00:46.079> it'll<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.100> more

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
you're doing very much it'll be more

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.810 
you're doing very much it'll be more
luck<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.500> bit<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.680> technique<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.280> I'm

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
luck a little bit of technique but I'm

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.250 
luck a little bit of technique but I'm
going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.090> showing<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
going to be showing you how to do that I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.580 
going to be showing you how to do that I
can<00:00:52.770> open<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> lock<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:54.020> I<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.289> but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
can open a lock and one I don't know but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.520 
can open a lock and one I don't know but
we'll<00:00:56.039> find<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.640> quickly<00:00:57.090> though<00:00:57.530> I'm

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
trake I find I can open the lock very

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
trake I find I can open the lock very
quickly<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.380> gonna<00:01:13.470> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you need to get a tension wrench or

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.740 
you need to get a tension wrench or
torsion<00:01:27.600> wrench<00:01:27.860> tension<00:01:28.860> torsion<00:01:29.310> whatever

torsion wrench tension torsion whatever

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.819 
torsion wrench tension torsion whatever
it'll<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.960> flat<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:34.229> will<00:01:34.680> make

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
it'll be flat and bit and I will make

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
it'll be flat and bit and I will make
another<00:01:35.100> video<00:01:35.310> showing<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.960> how<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
technique you want to put it in the lock

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.280 
technique you want to put it in the lock
here<00:01:53.009> anywhere<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> make<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here anywhere you want to make sure you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.319 
here anywhere you want to make sure you
have<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> right<00:01:55.850> torsion<00:01:56.850> wrench<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.210> will

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
have the right torsion wrench that will

think<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.489> would<00:04:00.580> be<00:04:00.670> more<00:04:00.820> practical<00:04:01.180> for

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
think it would be more practical for

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.320 
think it would be more practical for
picking<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:03.489> really<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:04.000> take<00:04:04.150> your

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
picking you really have to take your

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.020 
picking you really have to take your
time<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:05.260> have<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.470> be<00:04:05.560> very<00:04:05.680> careful<00:04:06.280> for

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
time you have to be very careful for

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.830 
time you have to be very careful for
raking<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.600> can<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.959> don't<00:04:08.350> know

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
raking you can I don't know

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.449 
raking you can I don't know
because<00:04:09.590> on<00:04:09.770> one<00:04:10.640> rake<00:04:10.880> one<00:04:11.209> Rick<00:04:11.390> opened<00:04:11.959> a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
because on one rake one Rick opened a

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.780 
because on one rake one Rick opened a
high-quality<00:04:13.459> lock<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:15.250> think<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.430> find<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.760> be

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
high-quality lock I think I find to be

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.810 
high-quality lock I think I find to be
breaking<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.389> be<00:04:17.480> much<00:04:17.780> more<00:04:18.019> practical<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.820> I

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
breaking to be much more practical and I

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.480 
breaking to be much more practical and I
would<00:04:20.060> recommend<00:04:20.450> anybody<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:21.769> might<00:04:22.310> be
