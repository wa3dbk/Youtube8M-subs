that's<00:04:25.450> kind<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.690> tongue<00:04:25.840> twister<00:04:25.930> so

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
that's kind of a tongue twister so

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.390 
that's kind of a tongue twister so
there's<00:04:26.350> hcx

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
there's hcx

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.800 
there's hcx
then<00:04:27.639> your<00:04:27.759> regular<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.270> exes<00:04:28.630> are<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
then your regular the exes are the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.210 
then your regular the exes are the
latest<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.259> greatest<00:04:29.320> they're<00:04:29.919> very

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
latest and the greatest they're very

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.100 
latest and the greatest they're very
fast<00:04:30.430> they're<00:04:30.970> very<00:04:31.360> high<00:04:31.479> capacities<00:04:32.020> and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
fast they're very high capacities and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.060 
fast they're very high capacities and
you're<00:04:32.229> gonna<00:04:32.350> need<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:32.979> is

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
you're gonna need that because this is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.510 
you're gonna need that because this is
an<00:04:33.160> 18<00:04:33.790> megapixel<00:04:34.590> CMOS<00:04:35.590> sensor<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.340> can't

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
an 18 megapixel CMOS sensor so you can't

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.590 
an 18 megapixel CMOS sensor so you can't
see<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.729> in<00:04:36.820> there<00:04:36.910> but<00:04:37.060> behind<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.360> mirror

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
see it in there but behind that mirror

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.749 
see it in there but behind that mirror
there<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.139> very<00:04:38.500> large<00:04:38.860> sensor<00:04:39.400> an<00:04:39.490> 18

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
there is a very large sensor an 18

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.520 
there is a very large sensor an 18
megapixel<00:04:40.210> is<00:04:40.270> gonna<00:04:40.419> produce<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.810> huge<00:04:41.259> file

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
megapixel is gonna produce a huge file

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.490 
megapixel is gonna produce a huge file
especially<00:04:42.160> when<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.759> shoot<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.240> RAW<00:04:43.810> again

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
especially when you shoot in RAW again

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.600 
especially when you shoot in RAW again
if<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.710> don't<00:04:44.860> know<00:04:44.949> what<00:04:45.070> raw<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.550> you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
if you don't know what raw is and you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.650 
if you don't know what raw is and you
don't<00:04:45.699> know<00:04:45.850> what<00:04:45.970> kind<00:04:46.030> of<00:04:46.150> stuff<00:04:46.330> I'm<00:04:46.419> saying

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
don't know what kind of stuff I'm saying

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.170 
don't know what kind of stuff I'm saying
you<00:04:47.050> will<00:04:47.289> learn<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.650> use<00:04:47.979> this<00:04:48.190> but<00:04:48.460> most

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
you will learn is use this but most

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.640 
you will learn is use this but most

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
ability to shoot in RAW that's going to

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.210 
ability to shoot in RAW that's going to
give<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.600> lot<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:52.930> latitude<00:04:53.320> in<00:04:53.590> posts<00:04:54.100> when

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
give you a lot of latitude in posts when

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.740 
give you a lot of latitude in posts when
you<00:04:54.280> put<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.490> in<00:04:54.639> your<00:04:54.789> computer<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.330> have<00:04:55.720> a

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
you put this in your computer you have a

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.120 
you put this in your computer you have a
lot<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.020> great<00:04:56.259> things<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.620> do<00:04:56.860> with<00:04:57.009> it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
lot of great things you can do with it

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.590 
lot of great things you can do with it
another<00:04:57.940> thing<00:04:58.090> that's<00:04:58.180> really<00:04:58.300> great<00:04:58.509> about

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
another thing that's really great about

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.689 
another thing that's really great about
this<00:04:58.900> beyond<00:04:59.199> beyond<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.699> articulating

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
this beyond beyond the articulating

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.760 
this beyond beyond the articulating
screen<00:05:00.820> for<00:05:01.180> video<00:05:01.419> is<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:02.169> fact<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.680> has

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
screen for video is the fact that it has

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.620 
screen for video is the fact that it has
manual<00:05:03.160> audio<00:05:03.639> controls<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.360> one<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.570> the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
manual audio controls so one of the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.610 
manual audio controls so one of the
problem<00:05:04.900> with<00:05:04.990> taking<00:05:05.050> videos<00:05:05.470> on<00:05:05.560> these

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
problem with taking videos on these

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.469 
problem with taking videos on these
before<00:05:06.010> was<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.190> they<00:05:06.370> have<00:05:06.490> automatic<00:05:07.360> gain

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
before was that they have automatic gain

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.990 
before was that they have automatic gain
control<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.870> that's<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.470> big<00:05:08.830> no-no<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.669> makes

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
control and that's a big no-no it makes

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.360 
control and that's a big no-no it makes
your<00:05:10.150> sound<00:05:10.419> very<00:05:11.410> noisy<00:05:11.889> and<00:05:12.010> very<00:05:12.039> loud

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
your sound very noisy and very loud

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.890 
your sound very noisy and very loud
especially<00:05:12.520> when<00:05:12.850> it's<00:05:12.940> quiet<00:05:13.090> now<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:13.720> have

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
especially when it's quiet now you have

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.450 
especially when it's quiet now you have
manual<00:05:14.320> levels<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:14.830> can<00:05:14.949> adjust<00:05:15.070> them

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
manual levels and you can adjust them

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.010 
manual levels and you can adjust them
independently<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.720> when<00:05:16.810> you're<00:05:16.930> shooting

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
independently so when you're shooting

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.529 
independently so when you're shooting
Full<00:05:17.320> 1080p<00:05:17.440> video<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.820> kind<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.120> come<00:05:19.300> over

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
Full 1080p video you kind of come over

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.140 
Full 1080p video you kind of come over
here<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.530> plug<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:20.919> your<00:05:21.039> microphone

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
here you plug in your microphone

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.159 
here you plug in your microphone
actually<00:05:22.150> over<00:05:22.330> here<00:05:22.510> plug<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:22.900> your<00:05:22.990> mic

actually over here plug in your mic
right<00:05:23.800> there<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.220> then<00:05:24.639> you're<00:05:25.000> good<00:05:25.479> to<00:05:25.509> go

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
right there and then you're good to go

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.120 
right there and then you're good to go
and<00:05:25.930> you<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:26.080> automatically<00:05:26.710> control<00:05:27.009> that

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
and you can automatically control that

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.980 
and you can automatically control that
level<00:05:27.430> or<00:05:27.580> manually<00:05:28.330> control<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.720> level

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
level or manually control that level

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.870 
level or manually control that level
which<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.229> actually<00:05:29.620> much<00:05:29.860> better<00:05:30.039> there<00:05:30.849> are

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
which is actually much better there are
