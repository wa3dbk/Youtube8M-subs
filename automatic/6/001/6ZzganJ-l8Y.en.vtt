do<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.070> but<00:05:15.340> they<00:05:15.520> did<00:05:15.820> maybe<00:05:16.570> they<00:05:16.750> did<00:05:17.020> this

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
do that but they did maybe they did this

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.930 
do that but they did maybe they did this
so<00:05:17.409> people<00:05:17.740> could<00:05:17.860> utilize<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.490> vigilance

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
so people could utilize the vigilance

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.420 
so people could utilize the vigilance
before<00:05:19.330> declaring<00:05:19.659> attackers<00:05:20.380> even<00:05:21.190> then<00:05:21.400> you

before declaring attackers even then you

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.980
