 hello guys good today I bring you a 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.280
 tutorial 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:18.039
 or tips to defend your home and why 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.039
 many of which plays survival so 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.260
 I do not know in single player has many 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.890
 problems with the mods exploits you a 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.279
 clip in the face or other things happen to you 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 so I bring you 5 tips for 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.670
 defend your and so that it is not so 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 defenseless good first thing is the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 lighting so that mods put us 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.670
 near your home and combines well the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.649
 land where your thing is like that the monkeys 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 they will not come or they will have less confidence 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.190
 come to your house 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 second 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 have a place or place to change or 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.290
 to kill him without being seen or a place 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.830
 high 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.140
 why 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.140
 that is very useful since the clippers or 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.680
 zombie 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.320
 they come to your house and they explode and die 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.520
 but what you can do if you have a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.600
 house with two floors or a private 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.690
 you can do this 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.570
 go up here on the roof 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.300
 and here you take a bow or something like that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.910
 for you the juani 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.040
 then he had the barricades that would be 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.050
 the best for clippers and zombies 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.050
 that would be barricaded I do not know 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.460
 and lose 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.939
 so that the zombies or creepers will 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.090
 guys fall the dunks or fall into the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.259
 fence if you do not have so many problems with 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.579
 the entrance to your house since the zombies 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.509
 break the doors in this new 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.180
 update and that complicates it a lot and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 nothing these barrels are only very 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.760
 important but very important to them 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.860
 I recommend a lot 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.400
 well 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.990
 the doors this is always going to be what 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.550
 survival and in other series that I did 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.520
 what 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.290
 sometimes like this I do not have wood and I'm going to 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 look for a tree that is in front of me 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.819
 house but left the door open 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.780
 or decoration or by some way not 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.060
 I can explain how d 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.270
 for these videos 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.680
 and I'm short the tree I go back to my house 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.290
 and a cri enters but you exploit everything 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:03.350
 then it 's like very stupid and sometimes 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:07.030
 you die and the last thing to you for not 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.330
 be people who live underground 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.420
 more advanced things is with remains and this 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.030
 It has helped me a lot in a survival 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.110
 and it's very easy to do you do not have to 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.110
 use so many materials 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.640
 good 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.430
 they will not believe me but in my class 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.409
 they can make turrets the turrets have 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.349
 seen in dispensers and all those 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.470
 things that but sometimes this stretch 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.560
 slow then that makes them annoy them 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.209
 they can enter and we do not want that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.400
 then we do this next put 2 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:51.360
 copper or other reston material 3 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.750
 this torch then we needed a 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.190
 they are going to throw away 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.150
 slow 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:06.500
 then what you can do is join 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.500
 this cable to your house if underground 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.620
 you like that 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.400
 you have a slight 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.109
 so you see a zombie or something like that comes to you 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.519
 home 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.519
 you fill it with arrows 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.270
 Y 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.560
 this is going to throw the arrows but 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.870
 way very very very very slow so what 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.660
 what are you going to do 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.660
 make a direct cable to this 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 fuck 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.639
 double direct to the dispenser and that 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.380
 come to your house or to an accessible place 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:00.320
 so that to give exit and you put the slight 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.520
 As you can see, it's going to be very slow shooting the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.629
 arrow 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.629
 with the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.540
 missing here and here and here strict and that 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.740
 put except here and will throw the dates 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.510
 but slowly chile so for 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.500
 that shoots much faster makes it a 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:28.100
 external source and well as is 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.550
 and this is for the bric pursues are 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.440
 so I do not think that's all and I hope that 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:40.160
 they like these 5 tips to protect their 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.670
