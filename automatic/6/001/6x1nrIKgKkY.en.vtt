00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi guys welcome back to the bike man for

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi guys welcome back to the bike man for
you<00:00:03.589> instructional<00:00:04.589> video<00:00:06.020> today<00:00:07.020> we're

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
you instructional video today we're

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.890 
you instructional video today we're
doing<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.710> difference<00:00:08.189> between<00:00:08.370> gear<00:00:09.090> cable

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
doing a difference between gear cable

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.379 
doing a difference between gear cable
casing<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.040> casing<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> black<00:00:11.790> stuff<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
casing the casing the black stuff and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.490 
casing the casing the black stuff and
brake<00:00:13.200> casing<00:00:14.130> there<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> very<00:00:15.719> much<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
brake casing there is a very much of a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.950 
brake casing there is a very much of a
difference<00:00:17.039> between<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.789> two<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.600> big

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
difference between the two a very big

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
difference between the two a very big
difference<00:00:19.199> between<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.939> can't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
difference between the two and you can't

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.080 
difference between the two and you can't
mix<00:00:21.570> them<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.400> it's<00:00:23.400> important<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
mix them up and it's important that you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.410 
mix them up and it's important that you
don't<00:00:24.480> mix<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.580> because<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> built

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
don't mix them up because one is built

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
don't mix them up because one is built
for<00:00:27.630> rigidity<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> built<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.949> stress

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
for rigidity and one is built for stress

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
for rigidity and one is built for stress
and<00:00:31.980> torque<00:00:32.520> okay<00:00:33.270> let<00:00:34.170> me<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and torque okay let me show you the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.740 
and torque okay let me show you the
difference

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
difference

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.830 
difference
let<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.840> skin<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.739> off<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.190> here

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
let me skin some of this off of here

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.010 
let me skin some of this off of here
okay

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
okay

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.730 
okay
and<00:00:40.969> let<00:00:41.969> me<00:00:42.059> skin<00:00:42.329> some<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.780> off

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.030 

big<00:00:51.400> difference<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.110> what<00:00:53.350> these<00:00:53.560> two<00:00:53.830> look

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
big difference and what these two look

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.110 
big difference and what these two look
like

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.170 

in<00:00:57.240> your<00:00:57.840> new<00:00:58.050> clique<00:00:58.530> shifting<00:00:59.220> systems<00:00:59.880> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
in your new clique shifting systems it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.979 
in your new clique shifting systems it
is<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.900> important<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.640> cable<00:01:03.270> runs

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
is so important that your cable runs

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.040 
is so important that your cable runs
very<00:01:04.379> smooth<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.150> shifting<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.870> work

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
very smooth for your shifting to work

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.070 
very smooth for your shifting to work
right<00:01:07.520> now<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.479> difference<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
right now you can see the difference of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
right now you can see the difference of
these<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.400> both<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:11.970> Teflon<00:01:12.870> inner

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
these two they both have a Teflon inner

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.750 
these two they both have a Teflon inner
core<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> cable<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.990> runs<00:01:16.470> in

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.389 

your<00:01:23.760> casing<00:01:24.590> your<00:01:25.590> cable<00:01:28.070> runs<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
your casing your cable runs on the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.139 
your casing your cable runs on the
inside<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:31.369> okay<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> all

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
inside of that okay but this is all

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.969 
inside of that okay but this is all
built<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.660> strength<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.259> ease<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
built for strength and ease this is a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.680 
built for strength and ease this is a
gear<00:01:35.750> right<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.080> gear<00:01:37.470> cable<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:39.330> is

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
gear right here is gear cable this is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.280 
gear right here is gear cable this is
brake<00:01:40.619> cable<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.149> way<00:01:42.300> it's<00:01:42.479> twisted<00:01:43.080> like

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
brake cable the way it's twisted like

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.249 
brake cable the way it's twisted like
that<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:44.009> casing<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:44.850> thank<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> thank

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that your casing right thank you thank

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
that your casing right thank you thank
you<00:01:46.320> Sandow<00:01:46.710> brake<00:01:47.399> casing<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.390> twisted

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you Sandow brake casing and it's twisted

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.460 
you Sandow brake casing and it's twisted
and<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.830> how<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.479> whole<00:01:51.479> thing

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and you can see how that whole thing

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.830 
and you can see how that whole thing
works<00:01:53.160> okay<00:01:55.160> now<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:57.000> important<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
works okay now it is important when you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.740 
works okay now it is important when you
cut<00:01:58.289> your<00:01:58.590> casing<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.000> cut<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> properly

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
cut your casing that you cut it properly

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.859 
cut your casing that you cut it properly
and<00:02:01.319> with<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> good<00:02:01.830> tool<00:02:02.479> sometimes<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.690> can

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and with a good tool sometimes you can

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.449 
and with a good tool sometimes you can
get<00:02:03.990> away<00:02:04.050> with<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.500> pair<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.890> diagonal

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
get away with a pair of diagonal

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.240 
get away with a pair of diagonal
snippers<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.410> really<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.100> if

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
snippers but I would really like it if

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
snippers but I would really like it if
you<00:02:08.429> use<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.030> proper<00:02:09.360> tool<00:02:09.840> which<00:02:10.110> our<00:02:10.289> parent

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you use the proper tool which our parent

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.490 
you use the proper tool which our parent
knows<00:02:11.039> cable<00:02:11.819> cutters<00:02:12.240> we<00:02:12.480> only<00:02:12.720> use<00:02:13.230> our

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
knows cable cutters we only use our

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
knows cable cutters we only use our
cable<00:02:13.890> cutters<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> cut<00:02:14.370> casing<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.240> cable<00:02:15.750> we

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
cable cutters to cut casing and cable we

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
cable cutters to cut casing and cable we
don't<00:02:16.050> cut<00:02:16.349> string<00:02:16.770> it'll<00:02:17.310> dull<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:18.150> don't

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
don't cut string it'll dull it we don't

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.230 
don't cut string it'll dull it we don't
cut<00:02:18.599> wire<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.709> cut<00:02:19.950> cable<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.610> casing

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
cut wire we just cut cable in casing

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.480 
cut wire we just cut cable in casing
with<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.319> important<00:02:22.860> stuff<00:02:22.980> because

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
with it this is important stuff because

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.839 
with it this is important stuff because
you<00:02:23.610> want<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.240> smooth<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:26.280> gear

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
you want it to be smooth now your gear

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.870 
you want it to be smooth now your gear
cable<00:02:27.360> gear<00:02:28.349> casing<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.400> bad<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
cable gear casing it's not that bad you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.250 
cable gear casing it's not that bad you
just<00:02:30.090> give<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.420> little<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.810> keep<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
just give it a little you know keep it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.020 
just give it a little you know keep it
straight<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.740> boom<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.280> cut<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.760> flush

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
straight and boom you just cut it flush

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.410 
straight and boom you just cut it flush
right<00:02:33.660> off<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:35.240> with<00:02:36.240> it

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
right off like that and then with it

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.410 
right off like that and then with it
with<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.230> want<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.940> just<00:02:38.940> give<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
with this you want to just give it I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.229 
with this you want to just give it I
give<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.750> little<00:02:39.780> squish<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.239> just

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
give it a little squish like that just

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.780 
give it a little squish like that just
to<00:02:42.420> keep<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.349> make<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.920> keep<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.250> round<00:02:44.520> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to keep to make it to keep it round to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.210 
to keep to make it to keep it round to
get<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.060> round<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.870> then<00:02:46.349> I'll<00:02:46.530> use<00:02:46.739> my<00:02:46.770> little

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
get it round and then I'll use my little

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.040 
get it round and then I'll use my little
all<00:02:47.459> right<00:02:49.489> where<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.870> get<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:54.050> piece

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
all right where that to get that piece

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.140 
all right where that to get that piece
of<00:02:55.260> Teflon<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.430> talked<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:56.819> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
of Teflon like we talked about the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.670 
of Teflon like we talked about the
Teflon<00:02:57.420> housing<00:02:58.260> opened<00:02:58.709> up<00:02:59.840> okay<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:01.050> there

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
Teflon housing opened up okay in there

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.339 
Teflon housing opened up okay in there
to<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:01.980> able<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.250> receive<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.030> cable<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
to be able to receive the cable and

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.209 
to be able to receive the cable and
you're<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.770> do<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.189> both

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
you're going to have to do that on both

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.259 
you're going to have to do that on both
ends<00:03:06.469> with<00:03:07.469> the<00:03:07.590> break<00:03:07.860> casing<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.819> little

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
ends with the break casing it's a little

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:09.570 
ends with the break casing it's a little
bit

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
bit

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.880 
bit
different<00:03:09.970> because<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.960> spiraled<00:03:11.710> like

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
different because it is spiraled like

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.290 
different because it is spiraled like
that<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.760> get<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.270> bear<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:15.300> that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
that and you get a little bear and that

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.710 
that and you get a little bear and that
little<00:03:16.600> burr<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.730> can<00:03:18.910> see<00:03:19.210> how<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.420> little

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
little burr you can see how that little

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.630 
little burr you can see how that little
burr<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.230> right<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:20.980> you're<00:03:21.460> going<00:03:21.580> to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
burr is right there and you're going to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.490 
burr is right there and you're going to
have<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.910> get<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.180> on<00:03:22.270> an<00:03:22.450> angle<00:03:22.720> like<00:03:23.080> this<00:03:23.110> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
have to get it on an angle like this and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.560 
have to get it on an angle like this and
give<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> little<00:03:24.130> snip<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.090> cut<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
give it a little snip and cut that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.650 
give it a little snip and cut that
little<00:03:25.930> burr<00:03:26.140> right<00:03:26.530> off<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:28.300> it's<00:03:28.450> nice

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
little burr right off so then it's nice

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.380 
little burr right off so then it's nice
and<00:03:28.930> clean<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.440> open<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.010> then<00:03:30.370> again<00:03:30.760> use

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
and clean and open and then again use

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.230 
and clean and open and then again use
your<00:03:31.420> all<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.490> in<00:03:36.580> that<00:03:36.640> little<00:03:36.880> hole

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
your all to get it in that little hole

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.370 
your all to get it in that little hole
and<00:03:37.600> open<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.380> up<00:03:38.440> very<00:03:40.380> important

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
and open that up very important

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.650 
and open that up very important
obviously<00:03:42.150> always<00:03:43.150> use<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> furrow<00:03:45.780> after

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
obviously always use a furrow after

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.180 
obviously always use a furrow after
you've<00:03:49.660> cut<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.080> either<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.380> gear<00:03:50.740> casing

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
you've cut it either a gear casing

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.390 
you've cut it either a gear casing
ferrule<00:03:51.550> or<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.760> brake<00:03:52.120> casing<00:03:52.600> ferrule

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
ferrule or a brake casing ferrule

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.500 
ferrule or a brake casing ferrule
so<00:03:54.400> there's<00:03:54.610> your<00:03:54.790> difference<00:03:54.910> between<00:03:55.209> a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
so there's your difference between a

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.890 
so there's your difference between a
gear<00:03:56.020> casing<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.870> brake<00:03:59.370> Aysen

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
gear casing and the brake Aysen

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.949 
gear casing and the brake Aysen
very<00:04:01.900> important<00:04:02.320> don't<00:04:02.680> mix<00:04:02.920> them<00:04:03.010> up<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.959> want

you to never fear the bike man for you

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.470 
you to never fear the bike man for you
is<00:04:08.350> here<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.030> do<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.120> do<00:04:16.269> with<00:04:16.359> this
