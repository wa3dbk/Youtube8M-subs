00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.330
 for centuries the human being has 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.910
 studied its author making use of his 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.579
 more sense will be worth the sight first 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.110
 we are naked and later with 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.599
 instruments that powers at the most 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.400
 this ability as Mali saw with his 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.189
 telescope when he observed the actions of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.689
 Jupiter in colors that thanks to the use 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.180
 of the microscope published his book 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.850
 where micrograph is first 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.530
 spoke of the acb from that moment 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.870
 these instruments have been improving 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.250
 and perfecting making telescopes and 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.989
 microscopes of greater power and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.360
 resolution and looking for better environments 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.640
 observational 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.200
 however although it helps the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.270
 humans with this kind of tools 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 you will always be limited by your own 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.520
 meaning to be able only 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.170
 capture light in the visible range the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.790
 study of physics has taught us that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.350
 to be able to distinguish two objects 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.760
 we must observe them with light whose 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.100
 wavelength is less than the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.930
 separation between both objects so 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.370
 to observe smaller structures of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 a few hundred nanometers will be 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.090
 necessary the use of light with lengths 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 of minor wave like ultraviolet light or 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 the x-rays 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.310
 light is an electromagnetic wave of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.110
 so that although the human being is not 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.000
 able to catch her with her eyes out 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.980
 of the visible range can be registered 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 by detectors interpreting that signal 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.990
 with computers 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.670
 when a charged particle is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 accelerated it emits radiation 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.430
 electromagnetic 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.020
 that is to say photons that are particles 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.790
 elementary carriers of the field 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.920
 electromagnetic and constituents of the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.930
 light is in this phenomenon where you 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 base the synchrotrons 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.560
 these radiations emitted in the plane 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.630
 perpendicular to the direction of the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.550
 acceleration but if the particles are 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.530
 move at very high speeds nearby 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.450
 at the speed of light this radiation 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.010
 focuses on a cone whose base can 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.390
 measure less than one square millimeter to 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.350
 several regions of meters away 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.119
 Currently there are many facilities 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.090
 synchrotron around the world and in america 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.280
 14 in Asia and 19 in Europe, there is also 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 another 10 in project two of the introns 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.170
 Europe's most important are the srf in 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.520
 Re noble france and the beige and two in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.470
 Berlin Germany 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.209
 one of these 19 synchrotrons is Europeans 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.860
 is the newly incorporated among 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.760
 Another nalvarte is found in cerdañola 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 from Vallès barcelona 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.560
 these facilities are in the form of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.630
 ring whose perimeter goes from some 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.740
 tens of meters to about 300 in the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.740
 newer synchrotrons 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.370
 the synchrotrons are composed 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.230
 mainly from three parts a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.090
 linear accelerator in which they are injected 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 charged and accelerated particles 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.569
 initially to move to an accelerator 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.519
 circular which is the synchrotron 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.840
 properly said where the particles 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.329
 are accelerated at these speeds 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.590
 next to the light and finally it 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.540
 introduce into the ring 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.489
 storage where the particles already 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.290
 they do not increase their speed anymore from there 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.670
 the particle beams are drifted towards 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.319
 the light lines so that the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.590
 researchers can take advantage of this 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.590
 radiation 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.400
 as charged particles are usually 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.140
 use electrons since thanks to its 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.910
 small dough are easy to accelerate 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.890
 inside the ring the electrons 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.110
 circulate in packages so that light 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.060
 produced by a synchrotron is emitted 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.040
 in the form of short pulses the order of 5 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.140
 seconds separated by periods in light 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.879
 however being these periods so 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.650
 fast most of the detectors 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.260
 they capture the radiation as if it were 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.180
 continue so if you want to study 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.739
 phenomena of very short duration is 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.810
 necessary to use detectors 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.819
 special high frequency addition 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.049
 you can inject at least packages for 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.049
 increase the time between pulses 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.849
 the synchrotron light has very properties 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.620
 interesting that place it in a place 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.230
 privileged in front of another type of light 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.150
 the most interesting of its properties its 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.890
 great spectral range that covers so 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.019
 continues from the infrared to the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.189
 x-rays more energetic although the 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.540
 region that interests the most 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.879
 is the ultraviolet 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500
 far away and x-rays - since for 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.390
 ranges of visible and infrared light 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.629
 can be used in large series 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.629
 quality 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.830
 another important property is its great 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.420
 intensity density or brightness to be 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.580
 concentrated in a very solid angle 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.500
 narrow what gives the possibility of 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.660
 select a certain energy with 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.280
 a very small dispersion so that 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.800
 a great resolution is achieved in the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.870
 energy you also have to mention the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.850
 polarization of the beam that is linear in the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.530
 plane of the electron orbit and 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.030
 this circular mind polarized by 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.160
 above or below said plan 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.389
 making use of depths can 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.100
 obtained from circular polarization 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.100
 also in the plane of the orbit 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.500
 the technology used for the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.420
 selection of energies has 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.680
 evolved a lot to be able to take advantage 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.690
 maximize the advantages of 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.460
 synchrotrons to select a 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.440
 determined energy is made use of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.540
 monochrome players who disguise each 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 energy at a certain equal angle 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.570
 that makes a prism with visible light 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.280
 after the monochrome door it 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.500
 place a slit to a certain 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.810
 angle collecting energy health 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.550
 desired resolution in the selection of 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.740
 the energy depends on the opening of the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.860
 slit the more the slit is closed 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.479
 higher is the resolution 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.610
 within the possible techniques 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.009
 experimental that can be used in 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.560
 a synchrotron highlight diffraction and 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.629
 the spectroscopies the techniques of 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.370
 diffraction make use of the law of brad and 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.530
 are used to know the structure of 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.240
 the matter at the atomic level the technique 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.680
 consists in making an impact on the light 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.469
 over the sample and analyze the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.389
 scattering that the beam suffers in the shock 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.699
 among the spectroscopies highlights the 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.349
 photoelectric spectroscopy electronics in 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.699
 this technique you get information from 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.310
 the electronic structure of 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.289
 materials the spectroscopies are 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.669
 mainly used to determine 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.770
 the electronic structure of 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.750
 materials while being bombarded with 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.610
 x- rays the surface of the sample is 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.259
 measures the kinetic energy and the number of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.210
 electrons that escape from the layers more 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.770
 superficial electrons that 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.539
 they get away from the sample they are 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.759
 filtered by a shape analyzer 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.680
 hemispherical and only those electrons 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.069
 with certain energies come to 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.069
 detector 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.590
 like the electrons in the states of 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.719
 minimum excitation are quantified on 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.340
 resulting energy spectrum generated 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.960
 by the detector shows peaks of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.150
 resonance characteristic of the 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.370
 electronic structure of the atoms that 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.629
 they are on the surface 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.280
 thus allowing a characterization of 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.770
 the composition of the surface of the 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.780
 material the applications of light 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.969
 synchrotron are innumerable and at most 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.099
 diverse besides those already mentioned 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.409
 cover a broad spectrum that ranges from 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.030
 the art to determine the composition and 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.580
 painting techniques of hundreds 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.770
 from years to archeology to 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.349
 study small objects embedded in 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.539
 resins like insects in amber and going on 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.729
 for example medicine to discover 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.620
 how a bacterium like ere coli produces 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.750
 and secretes adhesive substances called 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.189
 pili that help the microbes get 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.129
 adhere to human cells 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.689
 for example in chemistry for the study 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.729
 of the development of molecules and 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:51.189
 very fast chemical processes in time 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.650
 real with physics among other applications 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:55.150
 is used to study the phases of 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.189
 balance of a compound at high 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.960
 temperatures or the study of 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.880
 structure of the molecules 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.130
 besides infinity of applications in 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.050
 the industry as in aeronautics for the 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.630
 study of materials in pharmacy and 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.370
 biotechnology for medicines energy 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.740
 and environment for energy 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.569
 more efficient even in 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.089
 higher quality food cosmetics 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.279
 On the other hand, the technique has also been 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:21.199
 seen benefited given that in the design 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.699
 and development of synchrotrons as well 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.629
 as in the elements that
