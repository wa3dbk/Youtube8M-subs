00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.130
 the triangle is the geometrical element of the indeformable nature by 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.009
 definition 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.889
 thanks to its triangle inner continuous action it is possible to obtain an optimum 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.390
 transmission of loads making both sides of the panel work in 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.539
 joint 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.640
 more than 1200 welding points per square meter in the case of the panel 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.360
 structural 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.840
 is a foal factor of great importance in its final composition this allows 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 only the stucco levy the final structural capacity 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.739
 both the structural panel and the master have thicknesses of 7 points 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.399
 6 centimeters of wire and wire in both cases is a free separation 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.380
 of 1 point one centimeters between the polystyrene and the wire 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.940
 this is of great importance since it is the only way to get two 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.530
 small reinforced concrete walls where the concrete is replaced by this 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 any iron ahead 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.960
 the scattered committee panels tested by infield of the University of Chile and 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 they are certified by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.990
 the construction with structural panels with intelligence placing 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.780
 8 mm diameter irons anchored to the Syrian envelope 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.820
 these sheets are placed every 60 centimeters at the most and with a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.570
 height of 40 centimeters above the level of its growth or whatever 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.400
 the separation between these times of 66 centimeters 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 so that it is inside the panel mesh 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.450
 the panels are placed and these are tied together 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 buys peace every 30 cents 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.620
 subsequently the largest in the world is placed 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.460
 which ensures continuity between the fans 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.230
 this May also tied by steps that were in the form of zigzag 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 in all its height 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.180
 the panel is tied to the anchoring sky with wire and if on top the polystyrene 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.480
 that is in contact with mess 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.020
 in the corners the union is made through greater agility as it 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 Place both inside and outside 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.600
 In addition, the perimeter walls should be placed a reinforcement consisting of 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 an eight-millimeter iron in the shape of an 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.390
 and that will have 40 centimeters per side 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.769
 this closures will be tied alternately on the inside and outside of the panel 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.369
 the openings of doors and windows can be done by cutting the panel and 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:22.409
 installed obie modulating their brushes and parapets in this case you should leave a 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.459
 pompous in the panel that resides the inkwell are subsequently placed 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.099
 through peace the ladders that will reinforce the singing of the hand in their 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 three races 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.049
 the lintels longer than 1 points 5 meters should be reinforced internally 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.439
 with 8 mm iron bars 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.680
 has been superior is made based on a metal channel 80 40 2 which is 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680
 welded anchor enclosures similar to those of peace 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.349
 this channel will have the purpose of receiving the trusses of the roof 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.059
 that alternate to pieces of channel perforated and soldiers to this same 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.609
 for the placement of the pipes and installations, the 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.489
 polystyrene using a bishop heat wave torch and then pass these 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.489
 pipes in the morning 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.589
 in the case of copper pipes this should not be insulated by lining the 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.480
 filter paper there was another element to avoid direct contact with magic 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.869
 of the panel 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.169
 on the other hand every time you're going to break the panel mesh for the 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.929
 placement of the pipes this must be reconstituted with a piece of sea and 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.929
 that ensures the continuity of this 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.009
 the panel covite that structural can also be used as a wife and lights and 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:49.019
 free up to 4 points 2 meters these slabs should be reinforced by the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.709
 placement of iron according to Castro 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.479
 the stucco can be done by means of a chicote or manual which is mechanized 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.919
 finally for the placement of the door and window frames once 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.549
 explained its walls burns the polystyrene of the singing up to 1 5 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.079
 centimeters deep that once filled with mortar leaves a load 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.079
 enough for tortillas such frames 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.939
 It is very important in the stucco layer to make a rigorous jury
