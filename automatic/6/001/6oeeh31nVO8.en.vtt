00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.779
 I am brosio learned I am not responsible 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.430
 of gastroenterology and endoscopy 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.420
 digestive of the company 3 high friuli for 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.040
 make you understand what the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.450
 gastroenterology digestive endoscopy 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.219
 modern 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.800
 I'll show you some little movies 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.050
 of our daily activity 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.420
 keeping in mind that the modern gas 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.619
 technology is halfway between the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.109
 surgery and the internist specialty 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.960
 the gastroenterologist is generally like 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.469
 we are an internist but to that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.699
 do with manual techniques that 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.280
 they also become their own little ones 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.260
 operative surgical operations that it 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.469
 very close to the surgeon's activity 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.999
 in this sense it talks to a great person 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.559
 number of other specialists 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:53.600
 to do this the gas and theologian 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.909
 has been using it for many years 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.519
 very advanced endoscopic instrumentation 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.829
 this instrumentation for the purpose is 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.239
 represented by tools that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.790
 initially they were optical fibers 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.210
 currently consist of one 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.580
 small camera mounted at the end 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.910
 of the instrument that you introduced in 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.640
 digestive cavities in the viscera allow 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:24.770
 a very accurate and even exploration 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.110
 withdrawals of biotic material then 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.490
 these are evaluated histologically 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 maneuvers are very refined and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.100
 they are practically performed with 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.380
 an absolutely excellent condition 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 tolerability on the part of the patient e 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.710
 even where there was a minimum 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.479
 this annoys generally comes 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.289
 attenuated through the use of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.810
 sedatives or energy 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.689
 obviously this requires staff 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.079
 properly trained and one 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.159
 technology that must always be in 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.159
 optimal conditions 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.030
 one of the fundamental conditions 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.329
 requests for the use of these 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.090
 safety equipment and safety 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.459
 which derives from the ability of the staff 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.370
 that uses it 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.950
 and also from preventing us from being able to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.410
 be risky situations for the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.799
 patient regarding the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.930
 possibility of transmitting infections 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.519
 and we have the possibility to arrive at 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.829
 of high disinfection conditions 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.970
 using equipment 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.549
 specially designed built that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.579
 they guarantee one hundred percent 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.260
 an adequate exploration of the viscera in 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.169
 safety 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.609
 this allowed to avoid the 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:59.609
 appearance of complications which also are 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:02.599
 inherent in any operational maneuver ed 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.280
 endoscopic or surgical in general 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.579
 these complications are now 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.799
 extremely rare and practically almost 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.500
 null for what concerns the maneuvers 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.260
 standard operating instruments 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.310
 employed has different characteristics 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.830
 depending on the indications and the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.920
 results that you want to reach 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.320
 there are dedicated instruments 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.840
 that even allow one 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.690
 magnification ie the possibility of 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.830
 use a zoom and then increase 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.270
 enormously the exploratory capacity 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.300
 identifying also lesions of 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.560
 very small one of the 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.370
 more common maneuvers implemented 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.220
 daily in a center left 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.040
 digestive scopia is represented by the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.070
 endoscopic polypectomy generally a 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.950
 colon level that includes one 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.620
 huge possibility with regards to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.610
 the screening and that is the prevention of 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.580
 those evolved injuries that can 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.990
 create oneself generated by the polyps 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.680
 intestinal 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.709
 the maneuver basically consists of 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.980
 the polyps that have a size la 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:28.890
 greater consistency in creating an in 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.990
 a liquid interface between the wall 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.450
 intestinal that is very thin is the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.210
 polyp itself in such a way as to 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.550
 allow and then resection 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.220
 using electricity 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.110
 another innovative technique he took 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.720
 a lot of foot in recent years is 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.410
 represented by when he discovered that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.020
 consists of integration with 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.900
 ultrasound endoscopy only 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.300
 that ultrasound is not implemented 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.310
 from outside to inside but 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.220
 from the inside to the outside, that is, there is 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.830
 a miniature ultrasound probe 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.960
 on top of the endoscope that 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.139
 introduced into the digestive tract 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.259
 superior infirm 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.759
 lower allows a display 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.110
 ultrasound of internal viscera with 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.949
 extreme precision 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.249
 this because the closeness with what 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.590
 there is to be studied and very close 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:27.520
 this not only allows one more study 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.090
 accurate but also the collection of small 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.580
 pieces of fabric that then come 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.020
 designed for a diagnostic definition 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.279
 best 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.590
 another advanced technique he found 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.960
 broad development in recent years is 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.120
 that of the angiography of the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.740
 pearson with retrograde geography 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.229
 endoscopic study 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:57.639
 endoscopic and radiological structures 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.289
 like the bile ducts and the pancreas but that 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.759
 especially allows at the same time 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:06.490
 care through a small intervention 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:09.249
 of pathologies that once up either 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.289
 many years ago they were treated only 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:13.599
 through surgery and 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.870
 then through a laparotomy that is 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.330
 at the opening of the abdomen 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.629
 this technique geography icon 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.599
 retrograde allows the extraction of 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:28.210
 calculations allows the placement of 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.129
 prostheses, that is, small tubes in the streets 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.919
 gallstones and in the pancreas to be able to 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.349
 allow the normal flow of water 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:39.219
 substances that are produced in the liver 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:43.689
 and the pancreas itself in addition to a whole 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:45.610
 set of other procedures they make 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.039
 the intervention is almost useless 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.419
 surgical into a significant one 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:53.680
 percentage of cases to conclude 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.550
 endoscopy represents a part 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.080
 important in gastroenterology 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.599
 certainly in the last decades the 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.430
 most predominantly part malga si 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.190
 he questioned is not alone and should not be 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.010
 only 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.310
 I know track as the patient 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:13.160
 in addition to wanting to be explored when there 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.920
 nor obviously the need requires 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.920
 also then the interpretation of that 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.440
 which was found and care of 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.660
 pathologies that have been found 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.350
 accordingly fate is also a 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:30.650
 clinic a dedicated clinical specialist 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:33.200
 but that needs to broaden its point of 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.630
 especially seen by interfacing as 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.810
 he said to start with other specialties and 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.840
 then to find solutions through 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.130
 a multidisciplinary approach in which 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.010
 radiologist surgeons also intervene 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.010
 inter seen the oncologists and so on
