00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
it's like an infinite zombie round and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.020 
it's like an infinite zombie round and
what<00:02:00.530> happens<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.039> all<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.280> zombie<00:02:01.820> have

what happens is all the zombie have
infinite<00:02:02.509> health<00:02:02.719> freegans<00:02:03.439> that<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:03.710> know

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
infinite health freegans that don't know

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.920 
infinite health freegans that don't know
you<00:02:04.430> know<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.700> more<00:02:04.909> rounds<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.479> go<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
you know the more rounds you go up the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.450 
you know the more rounds you go up the
tougher<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> zombies<00:02:06.740> getting<00:02:06.979> since<00:02:07.280> its

tougher the zombies getting since its

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
tougher the zombies getting since its
infinite<00:02:08.000> rounds<00:02:08.660> since<00:02:09.229> its<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.619> round

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
infinite rounds since its you know round

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.500 
infinite rounds since its you know round
infinite<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.550> means<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> zombies

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
infinite this means that the zombies

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.970 
infinite this means that the zombies
have<00:02:11.690> infinite<00:02:12.200> health<00:02:12.350> which<00:02:12.620> means<00:02:12.860> you

have infinite health which means you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.220

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
one or it's going to be a max this one

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.059 
one or it's going to be a max this one
because<00:03:18.239> again<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:18.810> gave<00:03:18.989> us<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.260> choice<00:03:19.440> to

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
because again they gave us a choice to

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.009 
because again they gave us a choice to
choose<00:03:20.280> which<00:03:20.519> ending<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:20.970> wanted<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.540> we

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
choose which ending we wanted so we

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.449 
choose which ending we wanted so we
don't<00:03:22.170> know<00:03:22.230> what's<00:03:22.349> going<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.500> happen<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:22.980> you

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
don't know what's going to happen if you

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.860 
don't know what's going to happen if you
guys<00:03:23.579> decided<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.150> ending<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> other

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
guys decided one ending or the other

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110 
guys decided one ending or the other
maybe<00:03:25.470> it'll<00:03:25.680> transition<00:03:26.220> over<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:27.000> next

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
maybe it'll transition over to the next

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.150 
maybe it'll transition over to the next
map<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:27.600> doubt<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.870> will<00:03:28.139> though<00:03:28.319> because<00:03:28.500> you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
map I doubt it will though because you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.949 
map I doubt it will though because you
know<00:03:29.250> having<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.000> major<00:03:30.180> plot<00:03:30.510> twist<00:03:30.840> like

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
know having a major plot twist like

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.360 
know having a major plot twist like
losing<00:03:31.380> all<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.620> characters<00:03:32.040> would<00:03:32.250> be

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
losing all the characters would be

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.129 
losing all the characters would be
something<00:03:32.579> difficult<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.299> we'll<00:03:33.930> see<00:03:34.049> what

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
something difficult so we'll see what

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.539 
something difficult so we'll see what
happens<00:03:34.200> with<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.280> hope<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> guys

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
happens with that and I hope you guys
