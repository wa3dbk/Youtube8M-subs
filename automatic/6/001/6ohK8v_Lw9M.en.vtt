00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
want that's that's pretty clear but I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.620 
want that's that's pretty clear but I
thought<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.400> second<00:01:00.730> half<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.150> even<00:01:01.360> at<00:01:01.540> the

thought the second half and even at the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.730 
thought the second half and even at the
end<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.870> first<00:01:02.080> half<00:01:02.200> when<00:01:02.380> we<00:01:02.530> were<00:01:02.590> down

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
end of the first half when we were down

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.120 
end of the first half when we were down
2-0<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.340> response<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.470> push<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.650> game<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.070> to

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
2-0 the response to push the game and to

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.099 
2-0 the response to push the game and to
keep<00:01:06.250> running<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.789> fighting<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.270> just<00:01:07.329> just

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:08.109 
keep running and fighting and just just

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.709 
keep running and fighting and just just
to<00:01:08.170> keep<00:01:08.320> going<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.740> thought<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.130> was<00:01:09.310> a

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
to keep going I thought that was a

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.149 
to keep going I thought that was a
thought<00:01:10.719> that<00:01:10.749> was<00:01:10.990> really<00:01:11.229> good<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:11.619> I'm<00:01:11.710> on

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
thought that was really good so I'm on

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.389 
thought that was really good so I'm on
that<00:01:12.369> end<00:01:12.609> you<00:01:13.240> know<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.649> be<00:01:14.799> really

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
that end you know we can all be really

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.099 
that end you know we can all be really
proud<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.700> ourselves<00:01:15.880> thing<00:01:16.299> I<00:01:16.570> think<00:01:16.960> you

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
proud of ourselves thing I think you

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.169 
proud of ourselves thing I think you
know<00:01:17.229> when<00:01:17.530> anything<00:01:17.770> goes<00:01:18.009> down<00:01:18.219> you<00:01:18.399> know<00:01:18.549> it

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
know when anything goes down you know it

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.399 
know when anything goes down you know it
becomes<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.539> little<00:01:19.630> bit<00:01:19.719> more<00:01:19.840> urgent<00:01:20.259> but<00:01:20.350> I

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
becomes a little bit more urgent but I

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.450 
becomes a little bit more urgent but I
think<00:01:20.619> we<00:01:20.679> have<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.829> do<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.009> from<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.189> get-go

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
think we have to do that from the get-go

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.279 
think we have to do that from the get-go
I<00:01:21.579> think<00:01:21.850> we're<00:01:21.999> too<00:01:22.119> lackadaisical<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:23.109> the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
I think we're too lackadaisical in the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.050 
I think we're too lackadaisical in the
first<00:01:23.499> half<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.310> lot<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.520> us<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:24.999> think

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
first half of a lot of us and I think

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.669 
first half of a lot of us and I think
I'm<00:01:25.240> second<00:01:25.509> half<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.079> energy<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.499> never

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
I'm second half the energy was never

I'm second half the energy was never
matched<00:01:26.920> their<00:01:27.130> match<00:01:27.640> them<00:01:27.819> physically<00:01:28.210> and

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
matched their match them physically and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.059 
matched their match them physically and
then<00:01:28.869> we<00:01:28.960> got<00:01:29.109> more<00:01:29.259> chances<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:29.859> you<00:01:29.979> know

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
then we got more chances and you know

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.499 
then we got more chances and you know
fortunately<00:01:30.399> for<00:01:30.579> us<00:01:30.609> we<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:30.909> them<00:01:30.999> away<00:01:31.090> even

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
fortunately for us we put them away even

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.940 
fortunately for us we put them away even
at<00:01:31.600> halftime<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:32.049> think<00:01:32.350> we<00:01:32.439> were<00:01:32.530> all<00:01:32.649> looking

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
at halftime I think we were all looking

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.620 
at halftime I think we were all looking
around<00:01:33.009> ourselves<00:01:33.399> going<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.060> know<00:01:34.179> we<00:01:34.450> get

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
around ourselves going you know we get

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.270 
around ourselves going you know we get
one<00:01:34.840> we're<00:01:35.049> getting<00:01:35.259> two<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:35.679> three<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.219> you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
one we're getting two and three so you

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.859 
one we're getting two and three so you
know<00:01:36.520> tonight<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.999> third<00:01:37.240> didn't<00:01:37.539> come<00:01:37.689> but

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
know tonight the third didn't come but

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.139 
know tonight the third didn't come but
on<00:01:38.109> another<00:01:38.439> night<00:01:38.619> at<00:01:38.770> will<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.159> think<00:01:39.549> we're

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
on another night at will I think we're

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.940 
on another night at will I think we're
just<00:01:40.179> so<00:01:40.389> unlucky<00:01:40.749> to<00:01:40.869> that<00:01:41.020> effect<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:41.829> need

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
just so unlucky to that effect you need

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.499 
just so unlucky to that effect you need
to<00:01:42.069> get<00:01:42.310> those<00:01:42.460> chances<00:01:42.729> back<00:01:42.939> from<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.210> lot<00:01:43.329> of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
to get those chances back from a lot of

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.730 
to get those chances back from a lot of
us<00:01:43.600> when<00:01:43.719> we<00:01:43.780> put<00:01:43.960> them<00:01:44.049> away

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
us when we put them away

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.289 
us when we put them away
I<00:01:44.770> think<00:01:45.310> they're<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.549> over<00:01:45.760> excitement<00:01:46.270> a

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
I think they're just over excitement a

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.510 
I think they're just over excitement a
lot<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.600> things<00:01:46.810> but<00:01:47.049> fermions<00:01:47.830> justice<00:01:48.340> you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
lot of things but fermions justice you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.620 
lot of things but fermions justice you
know<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.640> don't<00:01:48.970> think<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.180> deserve<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.479> lose

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
