00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.530 
the sub so we look important finally is
a<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> emphasis<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> t20<00:00:45.059> we're

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
a bit of emphasis on the t20 we're

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.000 
a bit of emphasis on the t20 we're
getting<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:45.989> games<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.710> used<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
getting a lot more games and we used to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
getting a lot more games and we used to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
Cup so that's great its outstanding

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.689

preparation<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:55.039> India<00:00:56.039> probably<00:00:56.280> similar

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
preparation for India probably similar

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
preparation for India probably similar
conditions<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> faced<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> over

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
conditions to what we faced it over

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
conditions to what we faced it over
these<00:00:58.829> next<00:00:59.039> couple<00:00:59.250> days<00:00:59.550> we're<00:00:59.850> spends

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
these next couple days we're spends

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
these next couple days we're spends
gonna<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> big<00:01:00.660> factor<00:01:01.550> probably<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
gonna be a big factor probably the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.249 
gonna be a big factor probably the
weakest<00:01:02.850> nothing<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> bounce<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
weakest nothing the bounce is much be a

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.540 
weakest nothing the bounce is much be a
little<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.559> slower<00:01:04.800> than<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.160> accustomed

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
little bit slower than we're accustomed

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.850 
little bit slower than we're accustomed
to<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.899> lot<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> cricket<00:01:07.350> needs<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:07.770> be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to so it's a lot of cricket needs to be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
to so it's a lot of cricket needs to be
played<00:01:08.100> between<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.789> World<00:01:08.970> Cup<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
played between now and the World Cup and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
played between now and the World Cup and
we<00:01:10.229> don't<00:01:10.410> have<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:11.160> perfect<00:01:11.430> now

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
we don't have to get things perfect now

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
we don't have to get things perfect now
we<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:13.020> things<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.350> close

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we want to try and get things as close

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.930 
we want to try and get things as close
to<00:01:13.710> perfect<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.130> possible<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> World<00:01:14.880> Cup

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940
