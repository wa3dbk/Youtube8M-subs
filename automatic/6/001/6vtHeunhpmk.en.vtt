redstone a blaze rod lapis and a raw
pork<00:01:44.909> chop<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> beat<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pork chop so you will have to beat the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
pork chop so you will have to beat the
weather<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.240> able<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.750> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
weather to actually be able to do this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
weather to actually be able to do this
so<00:01:49.079> maybe<00:01:49.560> listen<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.130> changed<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.610> bit

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so maybe listen get changed a little bit

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
so maybe listen get changed a little bit
this<00:01:51.000> recipe<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.750> could<00:01:51.899> always<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.259> do

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this recipe or you could always just do

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
this recipe or you could always just do
the<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:52.710> ol<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.130> let<00:01:53.280> me<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.369> spawn

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the good ol you know let me just spawn

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.510 
the good ol you know let me just spawn
that<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.780> no<00:01:54.990> one's<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.250> yeah

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that in no one's gonna know but yeah

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
that in no one's gonna know but yeah
once<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.570> items<00:01:57.719> guys<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.590> could

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
once you have these items guys you could

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
once you have these items guys you could
now<00:01:58.979> make<00:01:59.219> yourself<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.880> fired<00:02:00.450> mold<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
now make yourself a fired mold and to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.020 
now make yourself a fired mold and to
get<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
get that it's going to be the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.310 
get that it's going to be the
Philosopher's<00:02:03.540> core<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> middle<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
Philosopher's core in the middle and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.740 
Philosopher's core in the middle and
then<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> two<00:02:04.710> fired<00:02:04.979> molds<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.240> left<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
then the two fired molds on the left and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.690 
then the two fired molds on the left and
the<00:02:07.200> right<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.580> be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the right and then you're going to be

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.380 
the right and then you're going to be
able<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.300> cook<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.560> molds

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
able to cook that that molds

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.500 
able to cook that that molds
in<00:02:11.830> cubed<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.310> throw<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> furnace<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
in cubed so throw in the furnace and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.630 
in cubed so throw in the furnace and
then<00:02:14.930> after<00:02:15.380> that's<00:02:15.560> all<00:02:15.800> said<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.220> done<00:02:16.280> it's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
then after that's all said and done it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.820 
then after that's all said and done it's
going<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.120> give<00:02:17.330> us<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.080> Philosopher's<00:02:18.800> Stone

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
going to give us the Philosopher's Stone

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.449 
going to give us the Philosopher's Stone
so<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:20.300> gonna<00:02:20.420> show<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.690> right<00:02:21.050> now<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
so it's gonna show up right now and a

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.870 
so it's gonna show up right now and a
cook<00:02:23.709> BAM<00:02:24.740> we<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.160> our<00:02:25.340> self<00:02:25.580> and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
cook BAM we have our self and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.699 
cook BAM we have our self and
Philosopher's<00:02:26.690> Stone<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.440> what<00:02:27.620> it

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
Philosopher's Stone so this is what it

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.370 
Philosopher's Stone so this is what it
looks<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.350> a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
looks like and you can see this is a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.699 
looks like and you can see this is a
fired<00:02:31.010> Philosopher's<00:02:31.640> Stone<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.230> yeah<00:02:33.230> so

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
fired Philosopher's Stone and yeah so

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.980 
fired Philosopher's Stone and yeah so
basically<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.430> says<00:02:34.700> power<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.750> owner

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
basically it says power and the owner

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.070 
basically it says power and the owner
and<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.800> absorb<00:02:37.310> mode<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:37.970> right<00:02:38.180> now<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
and it's in absorb mode so right now you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.590 
and it's in absorb mode so right now you
can<00:02:39.110> absorb<00:02:39.680> blocks<00:02:40.550> with<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.239> look<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
can absorb blocks with this so look you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.150 
can absorb blocks with this so look you
could<00:02:41.780> absorb<00:02:42.170> blocks<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.830> pretty<00:02:43.010> much

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
could absorb blocks just to pretty much

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.460 
could absorb blocks just to pretty much
gain<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.060> power<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.600> take<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> energy<00:02:45.080> out

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
gain the power and take the energy out

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.470 
gain the power and take the energy out
of<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.709> block<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.190> can<00:02:46.310> see<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:46.910> using<00:02:47.239> it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
of the block so you can see I'm using it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.820 
of the block so you can see I'm using it
on<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.870> dirt<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.290> basically<00:02:48.440> sucks

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
on the dirt and it basically sucks

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
on the dirt and it basically sucks
everything<00:02:49.160> out<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.610> turns<00:02:49.820> into<00:02:50.000> sand<00:02:50.330> and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
everything out of it turns into sand and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.270 
everything out of it turns into sand and
that<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:50.720> take<00:02:50.900> whatever<00:02:51.410> power<00:02:51.830> was<00:02:51.980> left<00:02:52.160> in

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that we take whatever power was left in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.040 
that we take whatever power was left in
that<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.850> now<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.300> see<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:53.570> have<00:02:53.750> 12

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
that and now you can see we have 12

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.900 
that and now you can see we have 12
power<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.010> don't<00:02:55.190> get<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.370> lot<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.640> power

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
power so you don't get a lot of power

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.640 
power so you don't get a lot of power
from<00:02:56.180> Bruce<00:02:56.390> regular<00:02:56.810> blocks<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.350> think<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
from Bruce regular blocks I think you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.120 
from Bruce regular blocks I think you
literally<00:02:57.950> get<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.550> let's<00:02:59.360> see<00:02:59.980> yeah<00:03:01.010> each

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
literally get one let's see yeah each

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.670 
literally get one let's see yeah each
right<00:03:01.370> click<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:01.670> gonna<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.030> one<00:03:02.300> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
right click it's gonna be like one and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.199 
right click it's gonna be like one and
you're<00:03:03.680> gaining<00:03:03.920> yourself<00:03:04.519> some<00:03:04.730> power<00:03:04.910> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
you're gaining yourself some power and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.550 
you're gaining yourself some power and
what<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.390> power<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.720> used<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.989> do<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.440> use

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
what the power is used to do is to use

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.979 
what the power is used to do is to use
alchemy<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.280> change<00:03:07.850> blocks<00:03:08.420> out<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.720> their

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
alchemy to change blocks out of their

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.740 
alchemy to change blocks out of their
form<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.610> basically<00:03:10.610> guys<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.269> best<00:03:11.450> way<00:03:11.720> to

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
form and basically guys the best way to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.040 
form and basically guys the best way to
get<00:03:12.380> more<00:03:12.680> power<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:14.000> absorb<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
get more power for this is to absorb the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.560 
get more power for this is to absorb the
power<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:16.340> ores<00:03:16.820> here<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.299> can<00:03:17.450> do

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
power of these ores here so you can do

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.560 
power of these ores here so you can do
it<00:03:17.690> at<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> coal<00:03:18.140> iron<00:03:18.709> gold<00:03:18.950> lapis<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.060> diamond

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
it at a coal iron gold lapis and diamond

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.330 
it at a coal iron gold lapis and diamond
depending<00:03:21.079> on<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.230> rarity<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.890> or<00:03:22.040> it'll

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
depending on the rarity of the or it'll

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.370 
depending on the rarity of the or it'll
give<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.640> more<00:03:23.480> power<00:03:23.690> I'm<00:03:23.900> pretty<00:03:24.110> sure<00:03:24.260> so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
give you more power I'm pretty sure so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.259 
give you more power I'm pretty sure so
you<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.560> see<00:03:24.680> we<00:03:25.130> are<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.400> 42<00:03:25.850> let's<00:03:26.000> go<00:03:26.090> ahead

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
you can see we are at 42 let's go ahead

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.199 
you can see we are at 42 let's go ahead
and<00:03:26.420> absorb<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.750> coal<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.230> we<00:03:27.860> are<00:03:27.980> now<00:03:28.130> at<00:03:28.310> 106

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
and absorb a coal and we are now at 106

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.780 
and absorb a coal and we are now at 106
I<00:03:29.420> believe<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:30.140> Jesus<00:03:30.980> gotta<00:03:31.250> do<00:03:31.400> some<00:03:31.579> math

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
I believe that Jesus gotta do some math

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.090 
I believe that Jesus gotta do some math
I<00:03:32.150> believe<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.110> 64<00:03:33.739> right<00:03:34.579> 64<00:03:35.260> 21<00:03:36.260> what's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
I believe that 64 right 64 21 what's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.240 
I believe that 64 right 64 21 what's
9+10<00:03:37.370> 21<00:03:38.410> no<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:39.709> seriousness<00:03:39.890> let's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
9+10 21 no but in all seriousness let's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.069 
9+10 21 no but in all seriousness let's
go<00:03:40.370> ahead<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:40.700> take<00:03:40.820> an<00:03:40.970> iron<00:03:41.180> that's<00:03:41.780> going

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
go ahead and take an iron that's going

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.870 
go ahead and take an iron that's going
to<00:03:42.200> put<00:03:42.410> us<00:03:42.500> up<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.769> 360<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.340> die<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.640> get<00:03:43.760> more

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
to put us up to 360 to die and get more

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.750 
to put us up to 360 to die and get more
math<00:03:44.090> har<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:45.860> need<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> calculator

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
math har this is I I need a calculator

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.789 
math har this is I I need a calculator
I'm<00:03:47.750> just<00:03:47.900> gonna<00:03:48.019> open<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.200> calculator<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.650> to

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
I'm just gonna open a calculator just to

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.949 
I'm just gonna open a calculator just to
kind<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:48.980> speed<00:03:49.190> things<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.810> were<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
kind of speed things up so we were a

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.440 
kind of speed things up so we were a
hundred<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.739> six<00:03:52.370> right<00:03:52.579> so<00:03:53.410> 362<00:03:54.410> -<00:03:55.239> 106

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
hundred and six right so 362 - 106

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.280 
hundred and six right so 362 - 106
that<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:57.280> 256<00:03:58.280> from<00:03:59.000> iron<00:03:59.239> let's<00:03:59.840> go<00:03:59.989> ahead<00:04:00.079> and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
that is 256 from iron let's go ahead and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.720 
that is 256 from iron let's go ahead and
move<00:04:00.380> on<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.709> our<00:04:00.739> next<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:01.280> which<00:04:01.489> would<00:04:01.579> be

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
move on to our next one which would be

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.080 
move on to our next one which would be
gold<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.239> we're<00:04:02.360> at<00:04:02.480> 362<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.799> we<00:04:04.519> are<00:04:04.610> now<00:04:04.790> at

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
gold so we're at 362 and we are now at

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.180 
gold so we're at 362 and we are now at
874<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.110> as<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.350> can<00:04:06.470> see<00:04:06.590> as<00:04:06.799> we're<00:04:07.040> getting

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
874 so as you can see as we're getting

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.990 
874 so as you can see as we're getting
to<00:04:07.340> like<00:04:07.549> Rare<00:04:07.820> or<00:04:08.090> as<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.359> goes<00:04:08.480> up<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:08.900> I'd<00:04:09.799> be

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
to like Rare or as it goes up so I'd be

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.900 
to like Rare or as it goes up so I'd be
874<00:04:11.000> -<00:04:11.690> 362<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.400> going<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.700> give<00:04:13.820> us

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
874 - 362 and that is going to give us

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.449 
874 - 362 and that is going to give us
512<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.780> every<00:04:15.380> gold<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.799> absorb<00:04:16.130> what<00:04:16.340> the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
512 so every gold you absorb what the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.890 
512 so every gold you absorb what the
Philosopher's<00:04:16.940> Stone<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.329> going<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.630> give<00:04:17.780> you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
Philosopher's Stone is going to give you

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.279 
Philosopher's Stone is going to give you
512<00:04:18.769> power<00:04:19.070> we<00:04:19.760> go<00:04:19.880> ahead<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.209> take<00:04:21.019> one<00:04:21.200> for

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
512 power we go ahead and take one for

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.930 
512 power we go ahead and take one for
the<00:04:21.380> lab<00:04:21.530> let<00:04:21.709> me<00:04:21.799> just<00:04:21.950> see<00:04:22.039> we're<00:04:22.250> at<00:04:22.310> 874

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
the lab let me just see we're at 874

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.770 
the lab let me just see we're at 874
that<00:04:23.360> might<00:04:23.510> give<00:04:23.660> us

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
that might give us

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.530 
that might give us
less<00:04:24.050> oh<00:04:24.410> my<00:04:24.920> gosh<00:04:25.130> no<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.639> didn't<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.060> gave

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
less oh my gosh no it didn't that gave

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.350 
less oh my gosh no it didn't that gave
us<00:04:29.800> 1,024<00:04:30.800> what<00:04:31.400> was<00:04:31.520> her<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.940> forgot<00:04:32.240> our

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
us 1,024 what was her that I forgot our

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.900 
us 1,024 what was her that I forgot our
last<00:04:32.570> number<00:04:32.780> over<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> thousand<00:04:34.040> weird<00:04:34.820> I'm

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
last number over a thousand weird I'm

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.370 
last number over a thousand weird I'm
gonna<00:04:35.120> see<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.510> you're<00:04:35.780> just<00:04:35.840> gonna<00:04:35.960> see<00:04:36.200> this

gonna see it you're just gonna see this

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.530 
gonna see it you're just gonna see this
gives<00:04:36.590> us<00:04:36.740> more<00:04:36.889> power<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.310> lapis<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.970> diamond

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
gives us more power so lapis and diamond

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.270 
gives us more power so lapis and diamond
give<00:04:38.750> us<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.960> most<00:04:39.139> power<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.770> you'll<00:04:40.100> see

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
give us the most power and you'll see

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.490 
give us the most power and you'll see
that<00:04:40.460> when<00:04:40.669> we<00:04:40.820> take<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.360> ore<00:04:41.780> or<00:04:42.020> like<00:04:42.169> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
that when we take the ore or like the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.290 
that when we take the ore or like the
power<00:04:42.740> or<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.250> energy<00:04:43.430> out<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.060> block

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
power or the energy out of the block

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.680 
power or the energy out of the block
itself<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:45.169> transforms<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.310> ore<00:04:46.460> into<00:04:47.060> gravel

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
itself it transforms the ore into gravel

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.360 
itself it transforms the ore into gravel
that's<00:04:48.169> how<00:04:48.290> much<00:04:48.440> power<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.889> sucked<00:04:49.160> out<00:04:49.310> of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
that's how much power we sucked out of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.909 
that's how much power we sucked out of
it<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:50.419> go<00:04:50.540> ahead<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.139> destroy<00:04:51.710> all

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
it just go ahead and just destroy all

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.220 
it just go ahead and just destroy all
these<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.730> can<00:04:52.880> see<00:04:52.940> stone<00:04:53.450> will<00:04:54.050> turn

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
these and you can see stone will turn

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.340 
these and you can see stone will turn
into<00:04:54.380> cobble<00:04:54.860> iron<00:04:55.570> it's<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.660> regular<00:04:56.960> stone<00:04:57.200> as

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
into cobble iron it's a regular stone as

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.990 
into cobble iron it's a regular stone as
well<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.860> then<00:04:57.950> it's<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.130> cobble<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.730> then

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
well and then it's a cobble and then

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.790 
well and then it's a cobble and then
from<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.270> cobble<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.900> gravel<00:05:00.290> from<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
from the cobble to the gravel from the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.500 
from the cobble to the gravel from the
gravel<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.250> sand<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.730> then<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.150> kind<00:05:02.480> of

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
gravel to sand and then you just kind of

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.000 
gravel to sand and then you just kind of
suck<00:05:02.720> up<00:05:02.840> all<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.080> power<00:05:03.230> but<00:05:03.470> these<00:05:03.680> blocks

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
suck up all the power but these blocks

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.080 
suck up all the power but these blocks
are<00:05:04.190> lowered<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.520> your<00:05:04.640> blocks<00:05:04.820> they<00:05:04.940> don't

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
are lowered to your blocks they don't

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.159 
are lowered to your blocks they don't
really<00:05:05.210> give<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.419> power<00:05:05.690> so<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:05.930> really<00:05:06.080> not

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
really give you power so it's really not

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.250 
really give you power so it's really not
worth<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:07.040> babe<00:05:07.640> just<00:05:07.880> completely<00:05:08.360> strip

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
worth it and babe just completely strip

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.590 
worth it and babe just completely strip
the<00:05:09.860> ore<00:05:10.070> out<00:05:10.490> of<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.760> block<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.480> just

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
the ore out of the block and it's just

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.940 
the ore out of the block and it's just
regular<00:05:12.020> stone<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.380> now<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.590> can<00:05:12.680> see<00:05:12.770> we<00:05:12.860> have

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
regular stone so now you can see we have

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.040 
regular stone so now you can see we have
over<00:05:13.210> 15,000<00:05:14.210> power<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.600> we're<00:05:14.720> still<00:05:14.900> in

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
over 15,000 power and we're still in

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.110 
over 15,000 power and we're still in
absorb<00:05:15.380> mode<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.160> well<00:05:16.340> what<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.729> could<00:05:16.910> do

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
absorb mode so well what we could do

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.430 
absorb mode so well what we could do
with<00:05:17.360> this<00:05:17.479> is<00:05:17.690> we<00:05:17.900> could<00:05:18.050> shift<00:05:18.290> a

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
with this is we could shift a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.680 
with this is we could shift a
right-click<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.070> we<00:05:19.580> are<00:05:19.760> now<00:05:20.030> going<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.600> be

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
right-click and we are now going to be

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.540 
right-click and we are now going to be
in<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:21.050> mint<00:05:21.320> mode<00:05:21.530> so<00:05:21.800> what<00:05:21.979> we<00:05:22.070> could<00:05:22.220> do<00:05:22.400> with

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
in a mint mode so what we could do with

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.100 
in a mint mode so what we could do with
this<00:05:22.760> for<00:05:23.030> right<00:05:23.120> now<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.540> mod<00:05:23.690> maker<00:05:23.930> is

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110

the<00:06:24.470> mod<00:06:24.620> maker<00:06:24.830> sees<00:06:25.070> I'll<00:06:25.220> send<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.640> to<00:06:25.669> him

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
the mod maker sees I'll send it to him

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.580 
the mod maker sees I'll send it to him
and<00:06:26.060> you<00:06:26.780> know<00:06:26.870> we<00:06:27.050> could<00:06:27.169> see<00:06:27.289> if<00:06:27.380> he<00:06:27.470> could

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
and you know we could see if he could

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.870 
and you know we could see if he could
work<00:06:27.680> his<00:06:27.740> magic<00:06:28.039> so<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.400> think<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.700> is<00:06:28.760> a

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
work his magic so I think this is a

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.870 
work his magic so I think this is a
really<00:06:29.780> really<00:06:30.560> cool<00:06:30.770> idea<00:06:31.100> of<00:06:31.400> like<00:06:31.520> alchemy

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
really really cool idea of like alchemy

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.640 
really really cool idea of like alchemy
science<00:06:32.300> and<00:06:32.419> stuff<00:06:32.599> like<00:06:32.750> that<00:06:32.960> you're<00:06:33.530> also

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
science and stuff like that you're also

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.680 
science and stuff like that you're also
gonna<00:06:33.800> see<00:06:33.890> guys<00:06:34.130> if<00:06:34.310> we<00:06:34.490> go<00:06:34.640> ahead<00:06:34.789> and<00:06:34.970> go

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
gonna see guys if we go ahead and go

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.420 
gonna see guys if we go ahead and go
back<00:06:35.960> into

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
back into

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.800 
back into
let's<00:06:37.850> actually<00:06:38.590> go<00:06:39.590> back<00:06:39.860> into<00:06:40.040> absorb<00:06:40.460> mode

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
let's actually go back into absorb mode

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.480 
let's actually go back into absorb mode
this<00:06:41.810> is<00:06:41.870> just<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.260> entire<00:06:42.770> process<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:43.400> if

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
this is just the entire process and if

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.950 
this is just the entire process and if
you<00:06:43.580> guys<00:06:43.700> really<00:06:43.940> wanted<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.540> while<00:06:44.810> in

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
you guys really wanted to while in

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.510 
you guys really wanted to while in
absorb<00:06:45.320> mode<00:06:45.470> you<00:06:45.650> could<00:06:45.770> basically<00:06:45.950> change

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
absorb mode you could basically change

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.430 
absorb mode you could basically change
an<00:06:46.639> entire<00:06:46.730> biome<00:06:47.510> let's<00:06:48.050> say<00:06:48.139> you<00:06:48.200> needed

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
an entire biome let's say you needed

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.900 
an entire biome let's say you needed
some<00:06:48.650> sand<00:06:48.950> or<00:06:49.100> something<00:06:49.310> you<00:06:49.580> could<00:06:49.760> just

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
some sand or something you could just

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.120 
some sand or something you could just
keep<00:06:50.270> doing<00:06:50.600> this<00:06:50.740> like<00:06:51.740> whatever<00:06:51.980> you<00:06:52.040> got

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
keep doing this like whatever you got

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.500 
keep doing this like whatever you got
you<00:06:52.280> no<00:06:52.400> longer<00:06:52.550> have<00:06:52.760> to<00:06:52.880> go<00:06:53.060> and<00:06:53.330> find

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
you no longer have to go and find

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.850 
you no longer have to go and find
yourself<00:06:53.900> a<00:06:53.990> beach<00:06:54.169> or<00:06:54.350> desert<00:06:54.650> you<00:06:54.710> could

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
yourself a beach or desert you could

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.470 
yourself a beach or desert you could
just<00:06:55.040> turn<00:06:55.490> whatever<00:06:55.790> block<00:06:56.090> you're<00:06:56.300> on<00:06:56.389> the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
just turn whatever block you're on the

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.210 
just turn whatever block you're on the
grass<00:06:56.720> and<00:06:57.110> you<00:06:57.169> could<00:06:57.320> turn<00:06:57.500> it<00:06:57.680> into<00:06:57.740> sand

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
grass and you could turn it into sand

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.920 
grass and you could turn it into sand
and<00:06:58.910> you<00:06:59.270> know<00:06:59.330> I<00:06:59.389> thought<00:06:59.540> that<00:06:59.690> that<00:06:59.810> was

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
and you know I thought that that was

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.480 
and you know I thought that that was
pretty<00:06:59.990> freakin<00:07:00.650> useful<00:07:00.980> I<00:07:01.070> don't<00:07:01.310> know<00:07:01.400> I

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
pretty freakin useful I don't know I

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.980 
pretty freakin useful I don't know I
think<00:07:01.550> that's<00:07:01.730> a<00:07:01.910> pretty<00:07:02.570> neat<00:07:02.840> little

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
think that's a pretty neat little

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.659 
think that's a pretty neat little
feature<00:07:03.410> there<00:07:03.530> are<00:07:03.710> pretty<00:07:03.889> nifty<00:07:04.220> stuff

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
feature there are pretty nifty stuff

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.340 
feature there are pretty nifty stuff
indeed<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.540> you<00:07:05.600> can<00:07:05.720> see<00:07:05.780> if<00:07:05.870> we<00:07:05.900> absorb<00:07:06.260> it

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
indeed and you can see if we absorb it

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.320 
indeed and you can see if we absorb it
again<00:07:06.530> it<00:07:06.680> just<00:07:06.889> completely<00:07:07.340> disappears<00:07:08.060> the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
again it just completely disappears the

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.450 
again it just completely disappears the
block<00:07:08.540> is<00:07:08.720> just<00:07:08.870> no<00:07:09.020> longer<00:07:09.229> there<00:07:09.530> but<00:07:10.280> yeah
