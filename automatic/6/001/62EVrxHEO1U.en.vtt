00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.070
 the bean is a vegetable that counts 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.260
 different varieties all linked by 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.630
 some features like for example 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.810
 the ability to enrich the terrain of 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.610
 nitrogen thanks to bacteria that develop 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.230
 close to the roots 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 therefore they are usually employed in 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.160
 a second moment of rotation 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.370
 cultivation and do not need to 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.980
 special fertilizations a first 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 variety and that of the dwarf green beans that 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.809
 they are planted in the ground 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.940
 only after the last frost of the year la 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.000
 distance between the rows is 50 60 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.070
 centimeters while on each row comes 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.930
 planted one plant every five 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.580
 centimeters 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.780
 the fruits are harvested as and when 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.780
 they ripen on the plant 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.530
 as for climbing beans 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.330
 need more space e 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.890
 nourishment than dwarf ones 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.670
 positioned wooden metal racks 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.490
 at the mutual distance of 50 x 100 cm 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.340
 at whose feet soul will be dug 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.070
 you deepen three centimeters in which you 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.370
 will sow from the end of May when 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.950
 the earth will be warm enough 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.760
 first collection comes after 75 days 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.760
 about 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.519
 finally the beans for their resistance to 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.019
 cold can already be sown in 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.169
 starting in March 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.740
 for the 5 centimeters deep and distant 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.310
 between them 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.210
 20 25 while the distance between the rows 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.699
 will be 40 the first crops both year a 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.699
 late May and continue until June
