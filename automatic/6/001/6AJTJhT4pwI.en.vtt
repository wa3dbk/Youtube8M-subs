00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.909
 ambulatory 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.969
 and is that you have to go so many times to a 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.979
 group of psychologists who sell you a 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.799
 medication as a group of psychologists

 well with myself I feel at peace 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.910
 with myself 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.050
 I love myself today I am my best friend with 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.040
 and wonderful people 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.560
 my friends in there that I've done 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 When I left, I just managed to cry. 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.899
 They seemed pretty and I 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.170
 the truth that grateful I think it is a 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 cute human group and it 's all people that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.409
 it's hard for them to live because 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.030
 they are weak because they are fragile because they are 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.030
 sensitive because 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 because there are people that when life 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.000
 It hurts sale it hurts others 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 and there are people who self-destruct in the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 time I said I have enough a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.060
 prison was I saw myself on screen and I 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 I realized that it was not me or I was 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.019
 many mistakes throughout my life 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.650
 but I know I'm a good mine I know that 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.280
 I am a good person and that in fact this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.620
 pass 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.890
 largely because of that we can not know 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.569
 some hurt the other person by 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.760
 things when you get angry with life you 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.900
 angry with the world not going out to punish 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.440
 the next punishment is yourself is a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.440
 way to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.790
 and decided to take out the hatred until the day 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.200
 today does not present any trait of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 abstinence or any symptoms of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.850
 abstinence at the same time I said 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.400
 good enough you attack and entered by motus 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.050
 own to a hospital 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.120
 to intern me and cure me 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.120
 there is the first big change
