boilers<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.520> boil<00:02:02.820> short<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.720> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
boilers to boil short I think that was a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
boilers to boil short I think that was a
very<00:02:03.900> crucial<00:02:04.170> wicket<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.550> reason<00:02:06.150> being<00:02:06.330> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
very crucial wicket the reason being you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
very crucial wicket the reason being you
know<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.260> kind<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.590> opening<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.100> was

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
know it was the kind of opening that was

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.910 
know it was the kind of opening that was
really<00:02:08.729> needed<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:10.229> would<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.500> wrong<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
really needed but it would be wrong to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
really needed but it would be wrong to
say<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.220> was<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> turning<00:02:12.420> point<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.810> know

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
say that was the turning point you know

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.360 
say that was the turning point you know
putting<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.470> pressure<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.950> him<00:02:14.070> saying

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
putting all the pressure on him saying

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
putting all the pressure on him saying
okay<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:15.030> out<00:02:15.240> that's<00:02:15.480> why<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.840> won<00:02:15.960> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170

okay you got out that's why we won the
game<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.470> know<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.710> not<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.930> at

he<00:02:32.310> got<00:02:32.520> out<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.300> others<00:02:33.570> came<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.930> they

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
he got out then the others came in they

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.420 
he got out then the others came in they
had<00:02:34.170> their<00:02:34.350> different<00:02:34.709> approach<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
had their different approach but it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.220 
had their different approach but it
didn't<00:02:35.670> work<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> particular<00:02:36.510> day<00:02:37.020> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
didn't work on this particular day and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.430 
didn't work on this particular day and
you<00:02:37.770> know<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:37.980> ended<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.490> getting<00:02:38.640> quite<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> few

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you know we ended up getting quite a few

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.960 
you know we ended up getting quite a few
catches<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.890> white<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> few<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.520> catches

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
catches and the white a few good catches

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.330 
catches and the white a few good catches
that<00:02:42.120> were<00:02:42.270> taking<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.830> overall<00:02:44.160> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that were taking so I think overall it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.949 
that were taking so I think overall it
was<00:02:44.459> good<00:02:44.640> pulling<00:02:44.910> effort<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.570> at<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> same

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
was good pulling effort and at the same

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.350 
was good pulling effort and at the same
time<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.530> good<00:02:46.890> feeling<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.459> was<00:02:47.670> done

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
time you know good feeling that was done

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.510 
time you know good feeling that was done
by<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.570> fielders<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> specialist

you<00:03:01.830> may<00:03:02.010> need<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.220> spinner<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.790> second

you may need a spinner in the second

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.990 
you may need a spinner in the second
innings<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:04.080> whether<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.430> go<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.790> with

two<00:03:06.030> two<00:03:06.420> combination<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.200> I'm<00:03:07.380> not

two two combination you know I'm not

between<00:04:43.690> me<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.260> him<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.310> plan<00:04:45.520> was<00:04:45.550> to

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
between me and him so the plan was to

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.840 
between me and him so the plan was to
stand<00:04:46.600> behind<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.140> can<00:04:47.320> cover<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:48.610> if

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
stand behind so I can cover that but if

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.850 
stand behind so I can cover that but if
the<00:04:48.970> bat<00:04:49.150> man<00:04:49.390> steps<00:04:49.630> out<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.260> keeps<00:04:50.530> playing

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
the bat man steps out and keeps playing

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.710 
the bat man steps out and keeps playing
by<00:04:51.130> stepping<00:04:51.640> out<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:52.000> know<00:04:52.090> then<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.360> had<00:04:52.570> to

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
by stepping out you know then I had to

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.750 
by stepping out you know then I had to
go<00:04:52.900> in<00:04:53.110> but<00:04:53.410> they<00:04:53.920> didn't<00:04:54.190> really<00:04:54.400> step<00:04:54.640> out

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
go in but they didn't really step out

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.400 
go in but they didn't really step out
which<00:04:55.000> meant<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.390> could<00:04:55.570> have<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:55.840> liberty<00:04:56.290> of

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
which meant I could have that liberty of

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.620 
which meant I could have that liberty of
