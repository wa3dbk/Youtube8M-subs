00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:14.070
 Law 8080 of 1990 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.049
 is an organic health law because 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.130
 provisions on the conditions for 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 promotion of health protection and recovery 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 organizing the operation of the services 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.360
 correspondence and give other 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.360
 measures 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.960
 according to article 1, this law regulates 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.540
 throughout the national territory, the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.150
 health services performed in isolation or 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 together permanently the 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.120
 possible by natural persons or 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.730
 public or private law 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 as we have seen do 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.970
 part of their 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 those people who make up the power 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.309
 executive in the health area are the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 legal persons governed by public law 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.489
 make up direct management at the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.790
 Federal would be the health ministry their 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 agencies at state level secretaries 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.770
 municipal health departments or 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.380
 equivalent in case if they have names 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.290
 different organs and their 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.619
 direct administration and at the state level 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.170
 within the executive power to the secretaries 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.440
 municipal health systems and all their 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 organs of direct administration beyond 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.189
 Moreover, in the three levels of government 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.990
 of health that make up the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 will be part of their 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.260
 Moreover, as we read in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.189
 federal constitution of 1988 there are 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.290
 those people from the private area 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.170
 whether they are natural persons 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.360
 or legal entities under private law that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.750
 the principle of complementarity 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.060
 the private sector can be part of the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.180
 their 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.880
 health is a public service and the whole 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.909
 public service is one that the law 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310
 what determines the public services are 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.459
 those whose dark entitlement 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.390
 riva is of the state means to say that the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.390
 withdraws the company's choice of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.910
 certain activities such as 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.880
 example transport services 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.510
 the collective supply services of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.050
 water electricity telephony 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.940
 among many others 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.580
 happens that the very constitution itself 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.489
 will exceptionalize two services 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.049
 due to their relevance 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.780
 are these services to health and education 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.780
 health education public services 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.610
 therefore exceptional because they have 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.730
 dual ownership 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 are activities that the law allows 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.519
 both by the state 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.000
 and by the private sector without 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.250
 need for a concession or 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.700
 permission for public services such as 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.650
 happens to the other 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.350
 it occurs that the state it will have some 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.410
 exclusive functions such as 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.959
 regulation, supervision and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.640
 control of all the actions and services of 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.370
 Cheers 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.890
 the execution of such actions and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.630
 services can be done either 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.160
 by the state and the initiative 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.420
 toilet 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.400
 when the state executes actions and services 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.850
 it does so through the single system of 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.940
 health through the organs that comprise the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.880
 direct administration and through the entities 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.480
 which make up indirect administration only 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.329
 remembering that there are entities of the administration 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.579
 to legal entities 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.700
 of public law and foundations 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.730
 state-owned enterprises that are 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.819
 considered by most of the doctrine 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.810
 legal persons governed by private law 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.540
 private initiative executes the actions and 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.450
 health services without the need to 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.600
 permission or concession but this does not 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.980
 exempt 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.430
 following a series of 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.020
 ethical standards issued 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.020
 by the state itself 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.260
 Article 2 states that health is a 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.510
 fundamental human right 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.990
 and the state must provide the conditions 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.110
 essential for its full exercise 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.510
 health is a fundamental right that 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.810
 is confused with the very right to life 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.260
 and the constitution advocates a decent life 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.770
 dignity of the human person, it can 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.090
 be regarded as one of the principles 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.040
 protected by our 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.460
 current legal 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.190
 paragraph 1 of Article 2 is 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.070
 explain what are the duties of the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.690
 state duties that we have already studied 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.060
 when reading the constitution 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.490
 federal of 88 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.910
 the first duty of the state is in the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.910
 ensuring the formulation and execution of 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.130
 economic and social policies aimed at 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.960
 the reduction of disease risks and 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.750
 other damages to the execution of all 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.810
 economic and social policies is 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.020
 related to the conditioning factors 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.480
 determinants of health and education 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.540
 culture food transport works 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.430
 among other examples are 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.370
 all conditioning factors and 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.260
 health determinants is logical that the 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.470
 implementation of all policies 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:52.450
 related economic and social 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.370
 one to these issues and it is related 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.840
 directly to the health levels of the 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.600
 Brazilian population 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.910
 The second state dvd is the 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.400
 establishment of conditions which 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.190
 ensure universal access and 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.520
 equal to the actions and services of 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:13.900
 health promotion and 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.890
 recovery of equality of 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.830
 universal access to health services and 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.070
 health it must be yes 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.110
 read from the standpoint of fairness issue that 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.630
 we also worked on the study 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.540
 of the federal constitution 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.120
 the second paragraph provides that the 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.690
 State duty does not exclude the duty of 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.460
 people in the business family and 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.970
 own society 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.760
 as has also been studied 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.120
 Federative Republic of Brazil created 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.640
 by the constitution of 88 is a state 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.430
 democratic right and state 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.400
 democratic right of the state and 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.620
 company has no responsibility in the 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.000
 political decisions to be taken 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.000
 organize the country
