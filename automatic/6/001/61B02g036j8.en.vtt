00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.160
 hello guys arctic san and you 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.090
 Today I will tell you and show you a review on 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.309
 sniper set scss this ball redex 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.990
 is the cheapest priced sniper 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.929
 he is 6 thousand five hundred pounds 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.580
 site of clothes you will find a Frenchman uniform 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.630
 to veteran black balaclava 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.999
 and the helmet of the weapon you find sks with 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.009
 sight under his svd trunk far 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.640
 combat ammunition melee and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.579
 butt thunderbolt 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.460
 the gun will be the stingray body he 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.289
 same bleed well as when creating a review 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.949
 I did not have crop I used 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.140
 nosferatu 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.140
 it is the same edge but only different 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.670
 coated and now move on 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.579
 directly to where with such a set 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.039
 as our network sks goes with a sight 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.679
 low multiplicity second level as well 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.719
 melee ammunition and a shotgun then 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.460
 it should be concluded that such an assembly 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.769
 will be effective only in the near 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.620
 distance at medium and long distance 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.170
 Set already small zabelin and for sight 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.250
 low multiplicity and inability to kill 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.050
 enemies 3 body cult when playing with this 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.800
 set you need to constantly hold on to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.660
 shelters 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.600
 and also try not to engage in direct 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.760
 fight with the opponent 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.770
 Now to the pros and cons of the first set 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.600
 plus is the low cost of recruiting 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.780
 comparing with other sniper kits 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.480
 6500 funds but don't rush to buy it 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.340
 not pumped scout will be very 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.350
 difficult to survive in melee with this 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.370
 set 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.890
 I would like to mention the second plus 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.900
 several things in the set namely 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.210
 ska s it opens twenty first 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.750
 level also cannot be bought forever for 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.460
 loan bleed oddly enough he doesn't 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.430
 seems so helpful but 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.340
 sometimes you can run around with him 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.020
 and of course butt thunderbolt 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.680
 The rest of the kit sniper to anything 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.210
 believe my experience and 3+ for today I 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.119
 discovered when creating this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.459
 The review is what to look for a vanshot with 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.830
 ammunition dipped head b on 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.959
 very close range of these ammunition 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.030
 significantly increase the damage only 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.670
 close range on the rest 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.820
 distances you may not be lucky and you 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.739
 can not kill the enemy with 3 bullets in the body 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.989
 there is also a lack of ammo 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.519
 to compensate for these two minuses 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.519
 use stores to enter 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.709
 Well, as you may have noticed, we smoothly 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.350
 moved to cons set well here 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.330
 just the main disadvantages are not needed but without 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.480
 a and narrow focus use 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.069
 recruit only melee combat 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.140
 I also didnâ€™t like the edge 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.620
 due to the presence of only two rounds in 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.290
 clip 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.690
 and a long recharge summarize 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.489
 our review kit is worth buying only 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.920
 in case you have extra 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.640
 functions or you can not tolerate 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.820
 sks or bleed definitely say that this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.260
 The set is not suitable for beginners on this. 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.450
 all dear friends subscribe 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.980

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.480
 Great weekend to everyone 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.850
 honest what
