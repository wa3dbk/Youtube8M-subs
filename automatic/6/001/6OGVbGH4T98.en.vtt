00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.580
 when we started working on a sheet 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.469
 of calculation must be taken into account 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.320
 the different formats of numbers to 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.420
 establish let's not forget that the numbers 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.720
 that we enter in each cell 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.400
 can represent values ​​in money 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.190
 ages physical stocks of a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.850
 inventory percentages and so on 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.730
 remember that if we format 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.330
 wrong to a certain number 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.130
 we could generate confusion with what 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.800
 We are presenting ourselves in our 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.770
 reports so in this chapter we're going 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.989
 to learn how to establish different 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.270
 formats to our numbers since if 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.480
 us for example if we enter a 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.600
 value that will represent money then 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.120
 we have to represent it as such ok in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.120
 this spreadsheet I have some 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.930
 information in the first table 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.370
 I have the header start saying the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.590
 seller's name then says 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.860
 January-February-March then the logic 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.530
 it gives me that it is a list of sellers 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.710
 who have made sales in the months of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.170
 January February and March but if they are given 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.010
 account the numerical values ​​do not have 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.100
 value format in money then for 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.780
 we have to 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.660
 auxiliary give us the tools that we 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.050
 gives default to excel these are 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.420
 found on the home tab 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.850
 specifically in the group number 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.170
 observe here we have it in sight 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.860
 note that here I have selected one 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.430
 cell specifically the cell of two in 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.770
 this drop-down combo that appears here 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.440
 in the legend that says general that is the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.180
 format that has set me excel to 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.280
 all cells is the format 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.100
 default that excel 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.680
 however predetermined mind when 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.380
 we enter text he 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.690
 and the sheet in the excel spreadsheet 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
 understands what is what text is 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 we enter numbers categorizes it as 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 number then therefore we could 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.900
 do summation without any problem 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.920
 even if it does not have the format of vido those 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.390
 numerical values ​​however for 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.050
 interpretations not to generate 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.150
 confusions you have to format 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.459
 specific of what we are 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.340
 representing in this case we have 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.130
 values ​​in money what we are going to do 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.840
 in this case it is to select the three 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.140
 columns that have the values in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.840
 money and we're going to press the button 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.600
 with the dollar sign ok 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.090
 however here clicking on is 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.230
 little arrow we have different currencies 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 of the different countries ok 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.049
 here I see that they look at something strange 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 these cells what happens is that the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.590
 content of the cell is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.069
 and it 's bigger than it is the width of 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.430
 the cell will self adjust 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.159
 ok here we have our 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.560
 first listing and we gave you the format 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.810
 corresponding accounting as 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.870
 you can see here in the legend of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.750
 drop-down combo already has the format of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.150
 accounting ok in the following listing 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.849
 we have a list of names 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.340
 each name has its respective age without 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.340
 But here it is not necessary to give 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.189
 specific format since ages are 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.280
 understand by just reading the header and 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:51.449
 it is known that it corresponds to an age 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.969
 ok the following list corresponds to what 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.799
 which is a cost inventory then 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.860
 I have in the next column what is 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.140
 This price retail 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.319
 in the next I have a column of 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.019
 discount rate 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.139
 note that none of any of the 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.389
 values ​​has the corresponding format 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.499
 for example the percentage column of 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.150
 discount 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.400
 you have to give the corresponding format 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 to avoid confusion we are going to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.440
 select what the whole column is 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.720
 the numerical values ​​and we're going to 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.729
 press on the percentage button ok 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.250
 observe how the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:36.090
 percentage symbol to each each value 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.849
 very well now let's go to what is the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.880
 values ​​in money this if it has to be 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:45.000
 accounting format we are going to click 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.030
 and we already have the format there 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.030
 corresponding here we have different 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.770
 formats that Excel provides us as 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.440
 for example the style of thousands 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.289
 and we can here we are going to 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.229
 Remove This format this will 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.050
 Click here in the drop-down combo and 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.289
 let's select general observe in 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.569
 the icon has letters above in numbers 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.699
 down means that the cells 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.000
 store text and store in number 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.319
 but Excel understands that it is text and that 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.240
 is number ok 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.280
 there we have removed the format of 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.130
 accounting let's do one thing 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.650
 different we are going to do to click here 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.790
 in the in the thousands style button 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.980
 observe, I will click 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.850
 and I have taken the gum appeared 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.490
 separator 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.040
 separator of thousands and what are the two 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.530
 decimals with this I can represent 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.390
 what is an accounting value that 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.670
 in fact in the cube legend 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.180
 drop-down so says it however not 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:59.990
 has the corresponding currency sign 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.950
 to a certain country ok 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.850
 when deploying here we are this 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.640
 combo this list gives us the different 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.580
 formats to establish the numbers and 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.200
 we can select what is currency 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:21.290
 short date accounting and so on 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:25.070
 these are predetermined formats that 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.810
 gives us excel there are also these others 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.820
 two buttons that allow us 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.780
 increase 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.050
 and decrease decimals let's test 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.030
 with these values we are going to or better yet 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.130
 let's select what are the 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.830
 ages this we would not have to give 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.010
 format but for practical effect of 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.520
 example let's provide decimals 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.260
 we are going to increase it observe the good 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.570
 simple with these tools that we 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.690
 provides excel now we're going to 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.690
 remove 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.840
 ok in this group number we can 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.270
 give all the formats that we 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.430
 we need the numerical values ​​that 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.580
 we enter our sheets of 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.680
 calculation today we have learned how to give it 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.710
 format to the different numbers that 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.960
 we enter ok see you in the 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.960
 next chapter until next time
