it's<00:03:40.840> working<00:03:41.200> out<00:03:41.290> fine<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.910> doesn't<00:03:43.299> show

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it's working out fine it doesn't show

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
the face on the back so that's a good

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.810 
the face on the back so that's a good
thing<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.709> also<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.920> last<00:03:48.070> part<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.640> set

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
thing and also the last part of the set

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.560 
thing and also the last part of the set
we<00:03:48.970> have<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.480> Emmett's<00:03:50.670> octan<00:03:51.670> catalog<00:03:52.329> I'm

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
we have is Emmett's octan catalog I'm

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
we have is Emmett's octan catalog I'm
assuming<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:54.700> we<00:03:54.790> go<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:56.230> shows<00:03:56.440> the

octan logo on the top and I assume it's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.920 
octan logo on the top and I assume it's
a<00:03:58.840> catalog<00:03:59.320> because<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.709> represents<00:04:00.280> or

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
a catalog because it represents or

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.259 
a catalog because it represents or
somewhat<00:04:01.930> looks<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:03.280> Lego<00:04:03.519> catalog<00:04:04.060> we

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
somewhat looks like the Lego catalog we

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.840 
somewhat looks like the Lego catalog we
get<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> mail<00:04:04.930> has<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.890> yellow<00:04:06.190> strip<00:04:06.670> on
