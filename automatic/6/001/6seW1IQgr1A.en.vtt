very best about the sims 3 are the hair
and<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> clothes<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:36.120> with<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and the clothes that come with the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
and the clothes that come with the
original<00:00:37.800> game<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.420> hairstyles<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
original game the hairstyles on the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.410 
original game the hairstyles on the
clothing<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.649> ordinary<00:00:41.120> however<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.360> do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
clothing are very ordinary however I do

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940 
clothing are very ordinary however I do
like<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.930> fact<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> customize

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like the fact that you get to customize

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.190 
like the fact that you get to customize
the<00:00:44.489> hair<00:00:44.670> color<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> clothing<00:00:45.719> colors

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the hair color and the clothing colors

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
the hair color and the clothing colors
and<00:00:46.469> patterns<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.399> gives<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.149> unique

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and patterns it gives a very unique

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
and patterns it gives a very unique
twist<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> game<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.039> create<00:00:50.250> your

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
twist to the game and can create your

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209 
twist to the game and can create your
own<00:00:50.579> styles<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.410> again<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:53.010> not

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
own styles but then again there's not

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
own styles but then again there's not
that<00:00:53.370> many<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.789> choose<00:00:53.820> from

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that many to choose from

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
that many to choose from
all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.379> clothes<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> look<00:00:56.129> awkward<00:00:56.340> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
right body shape if you go if they're

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.210

too<00:01:02.820> skinny<00:01:03.270> their<00:01:03.809> clothes<00:01:04.140> will<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.799> stick

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
too skinny their clothes will like stick

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.000 
too skinny their clothes will like stick
out<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.150> they're<00:01:06.420> too<00:01:06.990> big<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> clothes

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
will like cut into them because the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
will like cut into them because the
clothes<00:01:11.310> didn't<00:01:11.549> always<00:01:11.670> expand<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
clothes didn't always expand that way I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
clothes didn't always expand that way I
don't<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.760> game

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
don't know it might just be my game

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
don't know it might just be my game
graphics<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:17.900> yeah<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.320> happens<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
graphics but yeah that's what happens I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
graphics but yeah that's what happens I
thought<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> hairstyles<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> sims

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thought that the hairstyles in the sims

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.560 
thought that the hairstyles in the sims
2<00:01:22.560> were<00:01:23.159> much<00:01:23.670> better<00:01:24.830> they<00:01:25.830> even<00:01:26.280> had<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.570> more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
2 were much better they even had a more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
2 were much better they even had a more
a<00:01:27.840> greater<00:01:28.200> variety<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.860> styles<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.939> had<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
a greater variety of styles they had the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
a greater variety of styles they had the
normal<00:01:30.810> straight<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> kirlyam<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.430> ponytail

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
normal straight and kirlyam and ponytail

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
normal straight and kirlyam and ponytail
these<00:01:33.600> ones<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> weird<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.740> don't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
these ones are kind of weird I don't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.490 
these ones are kind of weird I don't
know<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
know I just don't like them that much

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
know I just don't like them that much
another<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.250> about

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
another thing that I don't like about

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
another thing that I don't like about
the<00:01:38.700> sims<00:01:38.909> 3<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> can't<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.350> into

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the sims 3 is that you can't go into

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
the sims 3 is that you can't go into
buildings<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.460> there's<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.329> these

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
do that in the sims 2 I used to make a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.470 
do that in the sims 2 I used to make a
lot<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.840> sense<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.530> videos<00:03:55.120> because<00:03:56.120> they<00:03:56.420> were

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
lot of sense to videos because they were

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480 
lot of sense to videos because they were
fairly<00:03:56.960> easy<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.710> there<00:03:57.830> are<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.980> lot<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.190> fun

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
fairly easy and there are a lot of fun

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.670 
fairly easy and there are a lot of fun
to<00:03:58.670> do<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.060> especially<00:03:59.870> since<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.650> use

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
to do and especially since you can use

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.960 
to do and especially since you can use
the<00:04:01.070> mods<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:02.300> create<00:04:02.960> better<00:04:03.760> results<00:04:04.760> for

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
the mods to create better results for

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.270 
the mods to create better results for
your<00:04:05.180> video<00:04:05.570> for<00:04:05.870> example<00:04:06.020> you<00:04:06.980> could<00:04:07.250> use

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
your video for example you could use

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.120 
your video for example you could use
things<00:04:07.760> such<00:04:07.880> as<00:04:08.180> Paul's<00:04:08.690> reaction<00:04:09.130> testers

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
things such as Paul's reaction testers

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.700 
things such as Paul's reaction testers
and<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:11.420> good<00:04:11.690> for<00:04:11.900> making<00:04:12.290> videos

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
and that was good for making videos

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.080 
and that was good for making videos
because<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.640> could<00:04:13.850> set<00:04:14.090> any<00:04:14.360> reaction<00:04:15.290> to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
because you could set any reaction to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.840 
because you could set any reaction to
your<00:04:17.090> Sims<00:04:17.770> interaction<00:04:18.770> with<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.160> sim<00:04:19.549> or

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
your Sims interaction with that sim or

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.420 
your Sims interaction with that sim or
