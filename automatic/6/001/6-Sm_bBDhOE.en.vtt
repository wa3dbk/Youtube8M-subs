we'll put the other one in hey this is a

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.010 
we'll put the other one in hey this is a
different<00:04:11.540> looking<00:04:11.990> power<00:04:12.110> supply<00:04:12.590> 200<00:04:13.430> watt

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.270 
different looking power supply 200 watt
they<00:04:15.020> look<00:04:15.230> different<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:15.710> it's<00:04:15.860> got<00:04:16.010> all<00:04:16.190> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
they look different but it's got all the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
we will plug it back up down on the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.440 
we will plug it back up down on the
motherboard<00:05:07.280> right<00:05:07.670> there<00:05:09.940> there<00:05:10.940> we<00:05:11.060> go<00:05:11.210> but

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
motherboard right there there we go but

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.370 
motherboard right there there we go but
only<00:05:11.480> go<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.050> one<00:05:12.080> way<00:05:12.290> or<00:05:12.830> at<00:05:12.890> least<00:05:13.040> it<00:05:13.190> should

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
only go in one way or at least it should

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
only go in one way or at least it should
after<00:05:15.380> I'm<00:05:15.500> done<00:05:15.560> hooking<00:05:15.950> all<00:05:16.010> these<00:05:16.160> wires

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
after I'm done hooking all these wires

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
after I'm done hooking all these wires
up<00:05:16.640> I'll<00:05:16.850> take<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.330> downstairs<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.950> will

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
up I'll take it downstairs and I will

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.500 
up I'll take it downstairs and I will
lightly<00:05:21.280> blow<00:05:22.280> air<00:05:22.550> through<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.120> clean<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
lightly blow air through it to clean the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.870 
lightly blow air through it to clean the
dust<00:05:23.690> out<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.230> before<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.310> put<00:05:25.640> everything

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
dust out of it before I put everything

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.150 
dust out of it before I put everything
back<00:05:26.150> together

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
back together

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.460 
back together
the<00:05:28.160> next<00:05:28.430> wire<00:05:28.790> is<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.240> main<00:05:29.510> wire<00:05:30.140> for<00:05:30.410> the

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
the next wire is the main wire for the

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.030 
the next wire is the main wire for the
motherboard<00:05:31.450> I'll<00:05:32.450> put<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.780> down<00:05:32.810> here<00:05:33.320> then

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
motherboard I'll put it down here then

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.490 
motherboard I'll put it down here then
plug<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:35.420> it<00:05:35.570> should<00:05:35.780> also<00:05:35.930> only<00:05:36.290> go

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
plug it in and it should also only go

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.450 
plug it in and it should also only go
one<00:05:36.710> way<00:05:38.200> now<00:05:39.200> all<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.740> rest<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:40.040> these<00:05:40.130> wires

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
one way now all the rest of these wires

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.070 
one way now all the rest of these wires
here<00:05:41.410> will<00:05:42.410> go<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.530> your<00:05:42.980> drives<00:05:43.780> your<00:05:44.780> hard

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
here will go to your drives your hard
