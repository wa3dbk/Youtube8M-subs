pc<00:01:59.369> platform<00:01:59.399> is<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> lead<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> build<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
pc platform is the lead to build the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.090 
pc platform is the lead to build the
engine<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.289> get<00:02:01.440> things<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> right

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
engine and get things like that right

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800
