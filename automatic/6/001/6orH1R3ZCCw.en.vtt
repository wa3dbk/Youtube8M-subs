00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.189
 as achivka here also your information 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.110
 computer this is not currently us 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 need 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 push analysis analysis gives some 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 time span the longer you don't 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.549

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.180
 you will undergo an analysis of me now 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.960
 found 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
 537 megabytes of garbage is important 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.369
 much more 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 can up to 3 to 5 gigabytes which is very 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.840
 slows down your work 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.960
 computer and lowered fps storms 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 the analysis went slowly press cleaning 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:09.319
 expect through which takes some 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.300
 time but here we go cleaning and us 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.450
 shows that cleared c43 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.700

 optimized second method 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:37.330
 we need to go to the computer 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.330
 properties advanced parameters 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.850
 additionally press the parameters and we 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.140

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.799
 indicate transparency beautifully sieve 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.540
 similar which is also good to can 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.850

 faster 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:37.010
 all who but for 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.890
 it is very important because the system is not very 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 stealing systems there it is quite useful 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.250
 I myself have worked with such a system with such 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.769
 view and no way did not touch now 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.180

 there's nowhere 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:10.459
 an hour to work me normally 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:11.750
 you will see learning usually the view itself 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.450
