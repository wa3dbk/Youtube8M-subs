Blu Studio X D750 In Depth Review

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.260
Hi guys so today we are going to do an in-depth review

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.090
of the Studio X D750

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.530
Today i got you guys a blue phone, its comes with a blue case

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.930
Its just a different from the black one that we did an unboxing on.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.179
Lets turn it on and see where it goes from there. Lets take the front sticker off

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.550
press the power button on the side

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.690
Lets put it to the side and go over the headsets for now

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.030
so the headsets are in-ear earbuds. They are 4 feet long which gives you

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.260
ample room to have your phone in your
pocket while listening to music

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.820
the headsets have a built-in
microphone

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.600
stop play and an answer phone calls

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.030
yet it doesn't have any volume control

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.410
and also doesn't come with any
adjustable

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.870
earbuds. So the charger sync
cable

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.930
is USB to Micro USB

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.550
it can be used to charge any other device
that a micro USB port

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.170
on this phone the plug is on top
instead of on the bottom that you guys

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.230
are all used to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.120
The phone comes in blue, the black as you guys saw in the unboxing

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.270
white pink and gold and the weight of the phone

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.799
its around 5.43 ounces

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.860
in comparison to the most popular
phones the iPhone

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.710
six which is 4.5 ounces and the Galaxy
S six which is 4.94 ounces

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.969
so keynote you guys got know is this is a

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.170
built in battery if you guys tamper with this
you know void the warranty the battery

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.880
itself is a lithium-ion

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.770
2100 million amps the standby time with

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.200
3g-enabled is going to be around 700

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.159
to 750 hours and the talk time is going to be
twelve to fourteen hours

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.070
if you disable 3G in use 2g you can
extend that time to around 20-25 hours

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.450
so it's up to you guys so the screen saw
five-inch

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.070
HD  IPS display so IPS allows you to see
radiant and vibrant colors

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.200
has over 16 million different colors

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.700
the resolution for the screen itself 720 x 1280

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.390
with 294 pixels per inch

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.090
this is the L line this is the D750L 
there is also the D750U

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.320
the only difference between the two lines
is the frequencies

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.490
the 3G frequency on the L is 850 1900
and 2100

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.600
and 3G frequency on the U line is 850

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.580
1700 1900 as you saw from the back

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.810
it can allow for two different SIM cards
to be installed

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.440
now the phone itself

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.530
it has a 8GB worth of space

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.590
and a micro SD slot that allows up to 64

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.800
gigabyte additional space. Performance
wise for

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.210
anybody that plays games are on their
phone and things like that it has

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.250

quad-core processor with 1 Gig of ram
and a mali-400 GPU

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.200

anything that you want to do. It has an
accelerometer gyro sensor a proximity

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.990
sensor and GPS are

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.780

just listen to the radio instead of the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.750
