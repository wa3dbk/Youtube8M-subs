00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 musically vibrant and 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.299
 It is also true in the life affirming 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.740
 second german trailer to no song 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.740
 save her body 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.809
 there would be 80 like 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.620
 that's incredible the rock stars do 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.180
 I do not know what to say 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.180
 i am not loved mainz 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.590
 the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.040
 almost real talent as many records with 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.840
 you do 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 I am not a format just writes off and 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 sometimes a passant you write 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 for what 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.930
 let's record an album and the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.930
 We take city as a reception room 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.840
 I recommend you on this song now 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.840
 not like that 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.930
 underpinned 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.970
 I think a nice second 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.799
 The marriage trailer is also just for that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 to emphasize the feeling of being in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 Kerners songs live in the studio 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 canal from 28 august 2014 in the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 bring German cinemas and easy 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.830
 should emphasize 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 what kind of audience this 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.250
 movie then made me put this the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 just like that so easy between the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.310
 read lines that say life is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.899
 sometimes difficult but still has 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.280
 all his good sides in those the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.750
 movies like wansleben 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 and above all, it is also in contrast 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.170
 to many other films so far something 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.390
 Strange imagines that the first 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.830
 trailer here to storytelling these and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 the second just a bit 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.979
 that's how hey do you still know this one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.049
 movie is coming soon, maybe it's something 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 moderate for you as pr machinery therefore 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.649
 I think that is quite well solved and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
 in cancer cell via live with the keyword 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.759
 together mark ruffalo two actors the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.899
 so not so good at first 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.880
 in front of the camera necessarily with each other 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.259
 works in the second somehow 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.790
 I am so unequal 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.260
 this duo is happy and the story 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.730
 Greta tells the one 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.269
 musician is going to be in new york 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.769
 want 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.000
 only her friend separates from her 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.500
 due to his own right 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 successful solo career is subordinate 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 she is alone and meets one 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.420
 music producers actually short around 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.530
 the career goes to the wall and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.329
 even not really in the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 But this one song wants to live her life 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.019
 plays in a bar in the evening and the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.609
 He saves his life and he saves 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.690
 swears a music album with her 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.970
 produce that in the most diverse 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.829
 places of new york and then it is quasi 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.570
 a film for all the music lives the 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.459
 also a bit the big city and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.260
 this urban feeling simply love of 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.180
 the dirt such big cities as new 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.500
 york brings just the right thing 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.880
 and that's why he becomes very famous and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.650
 very nice just a feelgood 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.359
 be possible where you just come out 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.980
 And yes, that's what life is sometimes 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.430
 difficult but sometimes it is easy 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.959
 beautiful 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.840
 That's why I'm looking forward to no chance 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.190
 take your life from 28 august and mag 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.390

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.739
 this second trailer check for 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.269
 I am then let through 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.280
 a thumb with that would let it 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.390
 stay if not know otherwise 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.650
