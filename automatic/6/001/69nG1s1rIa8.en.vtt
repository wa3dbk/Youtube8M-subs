to unfold this bike and I've only done
this<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.930> couple<00:01:00.050> times<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.219> this<00:01:01.399> is<00:01:01.520> really

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
this a couple times so this is really

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.670 
this a couple times so this is really
the<00:01:01.879> bit<00:01:02.059> from<00:01:02.180> an<00:01:02.359> inexperienced<00:01:03.020> person<00:01:03.170> so

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
you can see how easy it is so the first

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.539 
you can see how easy it is so the first
thing<00:01:07.399> we<00:01:07.490> do<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:08.140> unlock<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.549> handlebars

now they are in the position that you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.910 
now they are in the position that you
would<00:02:01.330> use<00:02:01.509> while<00:02:01.900> riding<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.830> the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.370 
what do you do is you pull it down and
you<00:02:10.929> pull<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> hand<00:02:11.500> bursts<00:02:11.860> down<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you pull the hand bursts down so this is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.400 
you pull the hand bursts down so this is
really<00:02:14.709> really<00:02:15.010> easy<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.660> then<00:02:16.989> we<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.260> this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
really really easy and then we have this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.350 
really really easy and then we have this
other<00:02:17.560> latch<00:02:17.890> over<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.400> which<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.120> have<00:02:19.209> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
other latch over here which you have to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.220 
other latch over here which you have to
pull<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:23.130> move<00:02:24.150> into<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.450> position<00:02:25.660> so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
pull out and move into this position so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.890 
pull out and move into this position so
basically<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.830> bar<00:02:27.160> right<00:02:27.640> here<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.450> go<00:02:28.630> up

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
basically this bar right here can go up

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.670 
basically this bar right here can go up
and<00:02:29.200> that's<00:02:29.530> what<00:02:29.739> unfolds<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> center<00:02:31.000> post

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and that's what unfolds the center post

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and that's what unfolds the center post
so<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.769> go<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:35.170> can

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
so you go like this and then you can

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000 
so you go like this and then you can
basically<00:02:36.700> push<00:02:37.440> till<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.739> see<00:02:38.890> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
basically push till you can see it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.559 
basically push till you can see it's
coming<00:02:39.160> apart<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.530> main<00:02:41.739> frame<00:02:42.010> into<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.150> this

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
coming apart the main frame into so this

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.350 
coming apart the main frame into so this
is<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.080> bike<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.799> folded<00:02:45.280> as<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.209> can

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
is the bike when it's folded as you can

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.759 
is the bike when it's folded as you can
see<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.810> pretty<00:02:47.200> small

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
see it's pretty small

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.090 
see it's pretty small
forms<00:02:48.549> like<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> little<00:02:49.090> triangle<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:50.100> and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
forms like a little triangle there and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.650 
forms like a little triangle there and
it's<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.489> important<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
it's really important that the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.039 
it's really important that the
handlebars<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.190> outside<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
handlebars are on the outside of the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.360 
handlebars are on the outside of the
whole<00:02:56.200> frame<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.769> jammed<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.340> between

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
whole frame and not jammed in between

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.039 
whole frame and not jammed in between
the<00:02:57.820> two<00:02:57.970> wheels<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.470> yeah<00:02:59.739> we<00:02:59.890> get<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.070> 360<00:03:00.790> view

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the two wheels so yeah we get a 360 view

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.830 
the two wheels so yeah we get a 360 view
and<00:03:02.049> now<00:03:02.590> we're<00:03:02.709> gonna<00:03:02.829> see<00:03:03.070> how<00:03:03.730> big<00:03:04.180> this

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and now we're gonna see how big this

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.770 
and now we're gonna see how big this
thing<00:03:04.930> actually<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:07.060> from<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.390> rear<00:03:07.600> which

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
thing actually is so from the rear which

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.370 
thing actually is so from the rear which
is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.049> widest<00:03:08.410> part<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.549> my<00:03:09.790> little

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
is the widest part and I have my little

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.229 
is the widest part and I have my little
measuring<00:03:11.380> tape<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:11.859> it's<00:03:12.790> gonna<00:03:12.970> take<00:03:13.209> a

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
measuring tape here it's gonna take a

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.069 
measuring tape here it's gonna take a
look<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:15.630> says<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:18.090> around<00:03:19.090> 68<00:03:19.720> centimeters

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
look and says it's around 68 centimeters

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.770 
look and says it's around 68 centimeters
which<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:22.230> 27<00:03:23.230> inches<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.359> in<00:03:25.359> terms<00:03:25.600> of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
which is 27 inches and in terms of

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.150 
which is 27 inches and in terms of
length<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.739> comes<00:03:30.040> up<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:32.260> around<00:03:32.500> 85

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
length it comes up at around 85

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.979 
length it comes up at around 85
centimeters<00:03:34.320> which<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.350> around<00:03:36.340> 32<00:03:37.000> inches<00:03:37.390> so

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
centimeters which is around 32 inches so

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:48.440 
centimeters which is around 32 inches so
that's<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.650> size<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.040> whole<00:03:39.250> package

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.880
