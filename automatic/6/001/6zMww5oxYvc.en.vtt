those lager beers so they lay on the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.369 
those lager beers so they lay on the
side<00:02:21.799> because<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.459> helps<00:02:22.849> allow<00:02:23.360> more<00:02:23.690> contact

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
side because it helps allow more contact

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.020 
side because it helps allow more contact
with<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> yeast<00:02:24.799> of<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.159> beer<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> helps

with the yeast of the beer and helps

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.140 
with the yeast of the beer and helps
that<00:02:26.180> long<00:02:26.560> maturation<00:02:27.560> phase<00:02:27.790> lager<00:02:28.790> beers

the<00:02:33.920> tap<00:02:34.129> um<00:02:34.690> good<00:02:35.690> question<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.379> it's<00:02:36.920> kind<00:02:37.190> of

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the tap um good question so it's kind of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.640 
the tap um good question so it's kind of
based<00:02:37.430> on<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> strength<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> beer<00:02:38.690> most

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
based on the strength of the beer most

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.220 
based on the strength of the beer most
of<00:02:39.769> like<00:02:39.980> our<00:02:40.220> session<00:02:41.030> II<00:02:41.180> weight<00:02:41.780> beers<00:02:42.049> like
