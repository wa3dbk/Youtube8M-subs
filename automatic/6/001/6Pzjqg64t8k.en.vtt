00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.700 
perfect and airbrushed now I'm going to
take<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.270> foundation<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.260> little

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
take a foundation that's a little

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
take a foundation that's a little
lighter<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.850> foundation

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
lighter and I like this foundation

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.830 
lighter and I like this foundation
because<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.930> dries<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> powder<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.210> i<00:00:51.239> use

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
because it dries as a powder so i use

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
because it dries as a powder so i use
this<00:00:52.170> under<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:52.890> eyes<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this under my eyes and it's just a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
this under my eyes and it's just a
little<00:00:57.000> lighter<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little lighter so it's going to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.560 
little lighter so it's going to
highlight<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
highlight but not just it's not going to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.529 
highlight but not just it's not going to
look<00:01:00.859> too<00:01:01.859> dramatic<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.730> i<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> for

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
