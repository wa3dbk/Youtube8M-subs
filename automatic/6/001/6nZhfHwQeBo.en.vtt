00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
having a female brand ambassador I

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.970 
having a female brand ambassador I
really<00:01:32.450> understood<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.170> because<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:33.740> men

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
really understood that because when men

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.910 
really understood that because when men
get<00:01:34.190> dressed<00:01:34.580> bigger<00:01:35.300> risk<00:01:35.420> for<00:01:35.690> us<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.770> then

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
get dressed bigger risk for us and then

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760 
get dressed bigger risk for us and then
we<00:01:37.100> get<00:01:37.280> dressed<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:37.790> get<00:01:37.970> rest<00:01:38.210> for<00:01:38.390> them<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.440> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
we get dressed we get rest for them so I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800 
we get dressed we get rest for them so I
think<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.310> made<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> lot<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.820> sense<00:01:40.910> in<00:01:41.450> which

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
think that made a lot of sense in which

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.440

is<00:01:41.960> why<00:01:42.080> I<00:01:42.110> were<00:01:42.380> very<00:01:42.590> excited<00:01:42.860> about<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.450> it's
