going<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.360> want<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.600> spin<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.080> way<00:01:45.320> because

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
going to want to spin this way because

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.410 
going to want to spin this way because
it's<00:01:45.950> going<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.100> be<00:01:46.190> spinning<00:01:46.460> this<00:01:46.550> way<00:01:46.729> so

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's going to be spinning this way so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.460 
it's going to be spinning this way so
it's<00:01:47.540> going<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.690> want<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.930> be<00:01:47.960> spinning<00:01:48.350> this

it's going to want to be spinning this

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
it's going to want to be spinning this
way<00:01:48.680> then<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.759> little<00:01:49.909> fan<00:01:50.240> back<00:01:50.479> here<00:01:50.720> blows

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
way then this little fan back here blows

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.370 
way then this little fan back here blows
the<00:01:51.500> tail<00:01:51.740> back<00:01:52.070> into<00:01:52.340> place<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:54.020> helps<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
the tail back into place that helps to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620 
the tail back into place that helps to
keep<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.680> stable<00:01:55.360> instead<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> doing<00:01:56.450> that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
keep it stable instead of doing that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.080 
keep it stable instead of doing that
though<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:56.990> have<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.500> rotor<00:01:57.740> blades<00:01:58.090> instead

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
though you have to rotor blades instead

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.210 
though you have to rotor blades instead
of<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.050> back<00:02:00.229> destroying<00:02:00.830> lift<00:02:01.070> you

have<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.520> contributing<00:02:02.210> your<00:02:02.270> lid<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.530> these

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
have to contributing your lid so these

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.630 
have to contributing your lid so these
have<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.920> little<00:02:04.280> bit<00:02:04.460> better

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
battery and a simple one cell charger

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.860 
battery and a simple one cell charger
which<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.209> don't<00:02:20.209> think<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.450> have<00:02:20.600> one<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.780> those

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
which I don't think I have one of those

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.370 
which I don't think I have one of those
anymore<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.640> anyway<00:02:23.000> um<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.540> has<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.660> 45-degree

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
anymore but anyway um it has a 45-degree

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.949 
anymore but anyway um it has a 45-degree
fly<00:02:24.590> bar<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> top<00:02:25.040> head<00:02:25.459> um<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.630> top<00:02:26.780> head

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
fly bar on the top head um the top head

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.199 
fly bar on the top head um the top head
is<00:02:27.079> completely<00:02:27.549> uncontrolled<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.850> does

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
is completely uncontrolled it just does

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.600 
is completely uncontrolled it just does
whatever<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.600> wants<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:31.070> fly<00:02:31.250> bar<00:02:31.430> gives

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
whatever it wants to the fly bar gives

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.910 
whatever it wants to the fly bar gives
its<00:02:31.790> inputs<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.269> if<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.750> blinks<00:02:33.110> too<00:02:33.650> much

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
its inputs like if it blinks too much

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.580 
its inputs like if it blinks too much
it'll<00:02:34.220> correct<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.140> bottom<00:02:36.260> blade

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it'll correct that in the bottom blade

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.250 
it'll correct that in the bottom blade
and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.190> isn't<00:02:38.120> stabilized<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:38.959> just<00:02:39.170> a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and then isn't stabilized it's just a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.640 
and then isn't stabilized it's just a
swash<00:02:39.500> plate<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:41.209> whatever<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:42.200> control

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
swash plate so whatever you control

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
swash plate so whatever you control
basically<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.730> inputs<00:02:44.060> control<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> bottom

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
basically your inputs control the bottom

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.720 
basically your inputs control the bottom
blade<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:47.950> helicopter<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> top

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
blade and the helicopter on the top

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.030 
blade and the helicopter on the top
blade<00:02:49.940> stabilizes<00:02:50.660> itself<00:02:50.810> which<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.829> why

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
blade stabilizes itself which is why

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.460 
blade stabilizes itself which is why
these<00:02:52.100> are<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.489> stable<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:53.989> they<00:02:54.290> don't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
these are so stable because they don't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.380 
these are so stable because they don't
and<00:02:54.650> also<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:55.430> cheap<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.700> easy<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.120> repair

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
and also so cheap and easy to repair

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.289 
and also so cheap and easy to repair
because<00:02:57.290> they<00:02:57.440> don't<00:02:57.620> mix<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.519> fly<00:02:58.760> bar<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
because they don't mix the fly bar and

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.550 
because they don't mix the fly bar and
then<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> swash<00:02:59.750> plate<00:03:01.120> um<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:03.440> pretty

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
then the swash plate um it's pretty

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.710 
then the swash plate um it's pretty
durable<00:03:03.920> little<00:03:04.910> helicopter

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
durable little helicopter

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.610 
durable little helicopter
