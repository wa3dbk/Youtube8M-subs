00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello today we are going to make a dress for 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.519
 candy using an old polo and paints 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.360
 you'll need an old cotton polo me 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.869
 Use white acrylic paints or pencil 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.380
 scissors marker one centimeter gun 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.090
 hot silicone cardboard pieces 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.340
 sponge with round shape and brushes 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.140
 to return to help dry more 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.140
 quick painting a fan 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.260
 Here I have a picture of them all everything 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.780
 that I 'm going to use to do the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.730
 candy dress 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.530
 Here I already have the lamp I am measuring 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.140
 with the centimeter the part of the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.690
 belly that is not so tight and the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.990
 part of lomito of the length of which I want 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.350
 my dress 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.840
 there I have the polo and 18 centimeters and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.390
 I have measured and bent the centimeter 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.600
 and mark now I'm going to mark the length that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.789
 it's 10 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.350
 and done as a rectangle with a 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.060
 pen and I'm cutting the cloth 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.600
 I am now removing the part of the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.119
 Waistband because I do not need it and it's going to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.970
 look like a half square semi 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.490
 Rectangle will keep you like this 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.710
 which doubled measures the part of the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 your dog collar as far 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.909
 kandy of 5 fingers of my hand so 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.280
 let's cut both ends right 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.310
 left those triangular parts 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 and let's now mark half moon only 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.890
 on one side and we're going to cut those 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 half moons I do not want to explain 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 so much I think that in the picture they are fine 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.869
 well as easy to understand these parts 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 so that the paws of the puppy go 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.240
 on the side of the right side as they saw 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.540
 was the open part I hit with 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.759
 hot silicone only one side because the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.490
 another was already folded I did not need 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.410
 Now what I'm doing is putting you 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 just a tiny dot of silicone in each 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.979
 extreme that would come to be both 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.869
 shoulders the top part as you see 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 well it's stuck I've doubled everything 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.700
 so that I do not see the seam I have chosen 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.250
 a long part that I left over from the pole 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.040
 with waistband and I'm crumpling like 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.950
 corrugated and sticking with hot silicone 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.540
 eye has to be on the back 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.459
 although there are the parts where we have 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.080
 crescent - shaped cut little arms have 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.269
 to be left down because it 's the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.250
 part of the puppy's chest and he has them 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.930
 to stay like this this is very easy if 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.520
 they prefer to sew it with a needle and a 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.460
 thread and then paste 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.500
 everything conjugate perfect try that 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.240
 the two ends left right 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.640
 so there is a small fold where they 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.860
 I'm pointing so that the dress will 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.500
 see more mono and more good combos already 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.020
 we have the dress what we are going to do 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.660
 now it is to turn it on the part of the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.420
 little feet and let's start putting him 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.720
 inside cardboard carton thick paper what 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 that you have to be able to paint over and 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.330
 that the fabric does not get stained by the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.330
 downstairs 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.490
 it will be like this when you put the 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.270
 cardboard and then we are ready to 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.270
 start painting 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.810
 I chose the round sponge of two 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.120
 sizes small size and the other 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.630
 a little bigger I chose for the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.850
 smaller balls the blue color in the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.819
 paint cap I put some of the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.219
 painting 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.030
 and what we are going to do is moisten a 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:38.510
 little round sponge 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.959
 and we're going to mark how you're seeing about 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.780
 the fabric like this are you going to make several 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.490
 circulitos in reality this is this is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.740
 the video that I show you how you 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.780
 I did gandhi, it's really like 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.890
 so you can give yourself an idea and they can 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.540
 get inspired 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.390
 if they want I can do it they can do it 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.790
 just like me and they hang it on facebook 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 and I happy but can do different 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.319
 designs different models of what 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.950
 you choose always they will leave 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.840
 cute here I'm done 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.810
 and what I have done is put it in a 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.870
 fan at full power to hurry 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.480
 drying the paint and being able to prove 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.540
 I'll model it so that this meat with 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.460
 her dress she happy already know that you 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.830
 love to wear clothes I do not put much 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.440
 it's very very rare very constantly 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.450
 he forgives clothes because they make him nudity 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 in one in the hair not but from time to time 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.030

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.930
