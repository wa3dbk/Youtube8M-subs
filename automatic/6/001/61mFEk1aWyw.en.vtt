 it's the world his cheeks jol apple has 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 presented his two new iphone 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.340
 iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus these two 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.359
 iphone differs from the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 screen size 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.090
 one is 4.7 inches and the other 5.5 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.490
 inch these two iphone are thinner 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.529
 compared to the iphone 5 is the iphone of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 last year the iphone 6 chip does 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 7.1 mm and 7 9 mm for the iphone 6 screen 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 of these two iphone has changed that's 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.390
 retina hd we go on lcd but with a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.050
 resolution that has been improved 1334 by 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.370
 750 for which 2 7 inches and 1920 by 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 1080 pixels for the iphone 6 chip 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.520
 iphone 6 + will thus have 185% of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.859
 more pixels than the iphone 5 is this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.149
 which is quite huge when it comes to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.940
 regards the characteristics one has a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.309
 8 64- bit processor at the CPU level 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.229
 it's 20% faster and the part 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 graphic it's 50% faster than 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.119
 the iphone 5 is also a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 coprocessor the m8 which is more 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 intelligent since he is able to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 see the different movements that you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 will realize for example it will happen to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 detect if you walk if you do 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 cycling or if you run for example 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.650
 the camera seduces 8 megapixels on 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.509
 has a focus that is faster 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 and more precise what will allow you to 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.549
 to take pictures of movements of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 quality 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
 it also detects faces more 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 quickly when it comes to videos 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 you can shoot in 1080p with 30 images 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 per second or 60 frames per second at 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.579
 idle mode level or is filmed in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.649
 240 frames per second which is all to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.750
 does huge we want to do also 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 burst photos with the front sensor 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.080
 and otherwise what concerns the device 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.210
 photo I think I said everything 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.920
 we also have an improvement in 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.960
 battery level by cons for 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.790
 iphone 6 plus autonomy is good 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.590
 better than the iphone 6 and well 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.690
 obviously with respect to the iPhone 5 s 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.690
 the new iphone are equipped with a 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.300
 nfc chip that will allow you to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.640
 tizÃ© apple pay which is a new way 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.890
 secure payment that is used by 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.710
 apple and who will be currently 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 only reserved for early states 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.380
 united wi fi will also be faster 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.570
 and we will have the opportunity to capture the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.090
 4g more so obviously your 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.090

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.220

 the apple watch so the watch connected 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.220
 apple with a screen of course 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.430
 who is touch on an apple processor 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.459
 if you have a speaker the vibration 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.780
 we have several bracelets to choose from 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.850
 two screen sizes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.140
 so that's not bad at all we have to 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.620
