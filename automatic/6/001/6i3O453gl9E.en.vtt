00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
couple of minutes for it to do the full

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
as this starts to crack and separate if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170 
as this starts to crack and separate if
you're<00:02:01.440> polish<00:02:01.800> underneath<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.400> wet<00:02:02.640> it'll

things but while we're cracking you can
see<00:03:03.109> here<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.409> over<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> glitter<00:03:04.730> it

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
see here is the over the glitter it

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.379 
see here is the over the glitter it
really<00:03:05.419> looks<00:03:05.629> meet<00:03:05.870> over<00:03:06.230> glitter<00:03:06.530> polishes

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
really looks meet over glitter polishes

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.699 
really looks meet over glitter polishes
you'll<00:03:08.389> still<00:03:08.659> want<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.930> go<00:03:09.019> ahead<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.500> put<00:03:09.680> a

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
you'll still want to go ahead and put a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.610 
you'll still want to go ahead and put a
top<00:03:10.040> coat<00:03:10.340> over<00:03:10.669> that<00:03:10.819> sometimes<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.840> polish

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
top coat over that sometimes the polish

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.229 
top coat over that sometimes the polish
the<00:03:12.769> crackle<00:03:13.099> polishes<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.669> somewhat<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.090> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
the crackle polishes have somewhat of a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.379 
the crackle polishes have somewhat of a
matte<00:03:14.540> finish<00:03:15.049> not<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.409> shine<00:03:15.769> finish<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.519> so

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
matte finish not a shine finish and so

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.270 
matte finish not a shine finish and so
it'll<00:03:17.719> have<00:03:17.750> kind<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.349> duller<00:03:18.620> effect<00:03:19.069> until

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
it'll have kind of a duller effect until

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.490 
it'll have kind of a duller effect until
you<00:03:19.639> get<00:03:19.849> top<00:03:20.090> coat<00:03:20.329> over<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:20.629> but<00:03:21.290> we're<00:03:21.409> going

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
you get top coat over it but we're going

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.689 
you get top coat over it but we're going
to<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.680> doing<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.189> just<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.519> minute

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
to be doing that in just a minute

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.439 
to be doing that in just a minute
another<00:03:23.659> fun<00:03:23.959> way<00:03:24.139> to<00:03:24.169> use<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:25.159> is<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:26.329> we

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
another fun way to use this is if we

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.360 
another fun way to use this is if we
started<00:03:26.810> here<00:03:27.019> at<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.199> top<00:03:27.409> corner<00:03:27.949> of<00:03:28.069> our<00:03:28.159> nail

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
started here at a top corner of our nail

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.939 
started here at a top corner of our nail
and<00:03:28.669> then<00:03:29.419> just<00:03:29.659> swipe<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.199> across<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.829> at

and then just swipe it across going at

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.199 
and then just swipe it across going at
an<00:03:31.040> angle<00:03:32.079> again<00:03:33.079> trying<00:03:33.379> not<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.949> over

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
an angle again trying not to go over

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.959 
an angle again trying not to go over
more<00:03:35.209> than<00:03:35.269> once<00:03:35.659> or<00:03:35.810> twice<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:37.400> can<00:03:37.639> get<00:03:37.819> your

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
kind of half and half nail effect okay

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.539 
kind of half and half nail effect okay
and<00:03:43.269> let<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.299> do<00:03:44.569> its<00:03:44.750> thing<00:03:45.189> find<00:03:46.189> if<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.430> have

and let it do its thing find if you have
a<00:03:46.579> hard<00:03:46.819> time<00:03:46.970> making<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.419> straight<00:03:47.689> line<00:03:47.840> you

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
a hard time making a straight line you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.339 
a hard time making a straight line you
could<00:03:48.560> take<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.790> lining<00:03:49.790> polish<00:03:50.299> do<00:03:50.720> like<00:03:51.049> this

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
could take a lining polish do like this

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.920 
could take a lining polish do like this
to<00:03:51.620> sort<00:03:51.859> of<00:03:51.949> finish<00:03:52.340> off<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.819> line<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.810> make

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
to sort of finish off the line to make

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.219 
to sort of finish off the line to make
it<00:03:54.109> nice<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.319> straight<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.599> then<00:03:56.599> even<00:03:56.930> just

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
it nice and straight and then even just

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:04.170 
it nice and straight and then even just
add<00:03:57.409> another<00:03:57.439> little<00:03:58.069> line<00:03:58.280> here<00:04:01.930> okay<00:04:02.949> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
add another little line here okay and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.140 
add another little line here okay and
then<00:04:05.180> what<00:04:05.540> we<00:04:05.689> can<00:04:06.109> do<00:04:06.259> here<00:04:06.560> also<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:07.970> can

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
then what we can do here also is we can

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.050 
then what we can do here also is we can
accent<00:04:08.629> with<00:04:08.930> some<00:04:09.729> rhinestones<00:04:10.729> or

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
accent with some rhinestones or

something<00:04:11.419> like<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.799> way<00:04:12.919> I<00:04:12.949> would

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
something like that and the way I would

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.990 
something like that and the way I would
do<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.879> take<00:04:14.540> just<00:04:14.810> some<00:04:15.439> top<00:04:15.680> coat<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.280> a
