00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
this way come on that's the lab right

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.390 
this way come on that's the lab right
there<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:08.110> are<00:01:08.320> going<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.650> rush<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.010> entrance

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
your way wouldn't it be easier for me to

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.940 
your way wouldn't it be easier for me to
sneak<00:01:15.310> through<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.550> side<00:01:16.080> no<00:01:17.080> there's<00:01:17.619> rocks

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.190 
sneak through the side no there's rocks
and<00:01:18.190> trees<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.729> way<00:01:18.880> I'll<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.869> go<00:01:20.050> around

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
and trees in the way I'll just go around

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.230 
and trees in the way I'll just go around
them<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:21.009> doesn't<00:01:21.550> work<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:21.790> way

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
them it doesn't work that way

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.410 
them it doesn't work that way
why<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.190> just<00:01:24.340> doesn't<00:01:24.640> those<00:01:25.270> are

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
why because it just doesn't those are

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.040 
why because it just doesn't those are
the<00:01:25.509> rules

if I can't they just build a sentry gun
they<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.869> far<00:01:46.079> away<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.770> base<00:01:47.360> here

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they have to far away from the base here

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.270 
they have to far away from the base here
myself

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

you've given us we've detected a psychic

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.839 
you've given us we've detected a psychic
amplifier<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:17.019> we<00:03:17.920> know<00:03:18.069> exactly<00:03:18.370> where<00:03:18.700> it

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
amplifier and we know exactly where it

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.640 
amplifier and we know exactly where it
is<00:03:19.920> new<00:03:20.920> terrain<00:03:21.189> discovered<00:03:21.939> as<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:23.230> can<00:03:23.409> see

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
is new terrain discovered as you can see

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.159 
is new terrain discovered as you can see
there's<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.159> psychic<00:03:24.609> amplifier<00:03:25.239> now<00:03:25.540> it's

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
there's the psychic amplifier now it's

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.500 
there's the psychic amplifier now it's
being<00:03:26.349> guarded<00:03:26.680> by<00:03:26.919> several<00:03:27.489> units<00:03:27.909> and<00:03:28.150> this

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
being guarded by several units and this

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.839 
being guarded by several units and this
individual<00:03:29.439> who<00:03:29.680> looks<00:03:29.889> strikingly<00:03:30.579> like

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
individual who looks strikingly like

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.420 
individual who looks strikingly like
Yuri<00:03:31.239> himself<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:32.650> think<00:03:32.919> this<00:03:33.069> may<00:03:33.250> be<00:03:33.280> a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
Yuri himself we think this may be a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.750 
Yuri himself we think this may be a
double<00:03:33.730> set<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:34.239> place<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.659> distract<00:03:35.139> us

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
double set in place to distract us

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.490 
double set in place to distract us
anyway<00:03:36.760> there's<00:03:37.060> also<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.419> Tesla<00:03:37.930> coil<00:03:38.200> which

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
anyway there's also a Tesla coil which

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.979 
anyway there's also a Tesla coil which
is<00:03:38.939> conveniently<00:03:39.939> powered<00:03:40.389> by<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:40.659> small
