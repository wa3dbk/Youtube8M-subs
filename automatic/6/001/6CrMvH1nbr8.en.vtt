not too much to say about my hair in

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.339 
not too much to say about my hair in
these<00:00:23.840> years<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.949> just

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
these years because it really is just

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.730 
these years because it really is just
bigger<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:30.029> longer<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.810> kind

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
bigger and a little bit longer than kind

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.549 
bigger and a little bit longer than kind
of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> middle<00:00:32.160> years<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.940> grown<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.780> but

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
of the middle years it's grown out but

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.500 
of the middle years it's grown out but
in<00:00:34.710> two<00:00:35.130> strand<00:00:35.399> twist<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.880> does<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.480> really

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
in two strand twist it does look really

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.119 
in two strand twist it does look really
shrunken<00:00:39.510> still<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.950> what's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
shrunken still so that's what's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
shrunken still so that's what's
interesting<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.360> blow<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
interesting and then if I blow it out it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.029 
interesting and then if I blow it out it
tends<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> look<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.480> much<00:00:46.379> longer<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
tends to look you know much longer it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.819 
tends to look you know much longer it
kind<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> shows<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.969> true<00:00:48.030> length<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.829> in

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
kind of shows it's true length so in

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799
