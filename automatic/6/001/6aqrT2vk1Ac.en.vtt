00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.550
 ah 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello very good older kids 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 presents a new video and well 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.520
 another tutorial and you asked me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 how to do as cybernetic plants 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.619
 Well, I 'm using this right now 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 and it's very simple you just need the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.689
 black background that I already have and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 you need what 3d plan as you want 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 put it right I'm going to put it so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 has been this would be fine we already have in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.170
 one part and now we just need to put this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.900
 here we put a little bit like that and another little 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 more espaÃ±a with this little one and it's even 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.379
 that this effect of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.379
 true good is not any effect but 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.190
 which is decoration but decoration that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.860
 it is very cool, and then this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.700
 we need to say it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.040
 we need plan 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.980
 of the state 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.260
 and wait for this this is black 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.730
 it's worth in this and it's worth the background 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.560
 it's going to be black they are not going to see 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.310
 and let's fit it assimilates flat and 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's worth one here 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 is what black is not going to be seen unless 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.740
 put something to try not to put anything 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.470
 and now we would have to leave plants 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 the plants I do not know if it's just 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.840
 hear the noise but good and you can 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.060
 put here block plan 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.719
 it's a yes I was waiting for moment that I'm going to 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.040
 do a little silly if you put a 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.010
 block 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.070
 and as we see the color to column 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.880
 and for one 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.330
 ok and then we can the tc well 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.659
 worth plan would be a normal level 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.490
 Oh 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.420
 today I am at a normal level it is worth and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.420
 lack 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.070
 I'm going to change this moment, I'm not going to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.000
 change but I'm going to move it because 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.820
 yes no 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 is going to move a bit because I do not want 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.340
 Let me know why I have to change 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.410
 with the vouchers and we put them like this and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.620
 we are also going to put the same thing but 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.230
 color that looks best is blue without 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.300
 doubt the light blue instance is very 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.650
 all right 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.480
 a unique touch one of color one is 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.939
 all color 1 and this we move to there 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 and it's upside down 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.920
 that would be more or less and you can do 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 there 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.140
 a structure like this so first do not you 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.719
 I do not know why but good nothing happens 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.680
 and you can put this up here 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:58.660
 clearly color one also 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.190
 here you can put one here on the floor 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.990
 how do you want that to our liking 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.300
 baleares the well-made structure 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.410
 touching that taste 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.000
 and also one does not get it is wrong and here 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.750
 we put 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.550
 this yellow and now hit a jump 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.410
 yellow unless it gives us the sea and 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.360
 here so that it does not remain more bland 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.600
 let's put something decorating to know 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.580
 something that we can put 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.290
 You expected me to look for something that is left 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.290
 well to see this 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.190
 you are not here it seems to me that it was where 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.330
 it was here it seems to me 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.840
 if this is part of your soul 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.210
 if I plan well 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.620
 1 and I do not know but it's not that we have left 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.800
 here 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.050
 yes one 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.050
 and it's the first time that his two mothers 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.010
 and this here 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.340
 and if we will see how I stay me 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.340
 so I have a plan like this 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.730
 how come we have been like this 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.640
 with a little corner 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.520
 big cube I do not know I can not think of anything 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.120
 so it's especially worth it but water there 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.540
 we have everything and now one here can 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.400
 be this corner and this 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.950
 there it is so we have the most effect or 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.750
 less with the cubes here you would have to 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.420
 play a little better and here we put the 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.370
 color color 1 because we started 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.740
 using vale I can remove the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.470
 critical as you want and we take a day and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.330
 there is only the level left and it is like that 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.240
 how would it look 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.510
 You not even look good I die 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.090
 it seems good to die but as 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.820
 you can see it's like some plants like that 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.700
 strange here you can appreciate better and 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.460
 you know what is that does not have much 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.580
 mystery in truth the plant is there 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.880
 It really looks great, I was 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.940
 used jrr 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.870
 used on a level not on board valera 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.980
 but he has used it and about this 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.900
 effect that I have here 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.670
 exploited the map of the previous video 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.320
 Well, I do not expect you to like the 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.320
 video is already approaching goodbye
