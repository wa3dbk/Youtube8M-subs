00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.959
 my name is m I am a student at 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.160
 the group's high school of design 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.809
 esc troyes promotion 2007 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.469
 this week I was attending the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.469
 music week 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.990
 no but a small presentation of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.779
 how was going to unfold our week 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.329
 we had to write a music one that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.980
 prefer the live 12 o'clock of the day in 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.730
 each group there were students 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.439
 in tourism 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.449
 their design so this helps 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.800
 international it was interesting to 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.480
 work people who are not 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.670
 necessarily design and who have another 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 perspective of things that presents you 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.180
 well all the tests but it's going 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.570
 all gathered to sing a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.370
 song 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.440
 I was very stressed it was not a 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.879
 when I was very comfortable at the furia 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.620
 week since everyone gets loose 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.570
 is inevitably I managed to relax 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.739
 a little the last days we've been 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.600
 all found in the arena for 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.370
 to attend the live so there was a 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.050
 great atmosphere all of them were disguised 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.310
 you 're happy to be here they're me 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.420
 sing 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.430
 you see that there was an event 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.870
 who had represented all the work 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.050
 we had done 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.180
 during the week were stolen by 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.430
 professionals from the musicians of the people of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.590
 show we're going to watch the clips 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.300
 it was very different we could see that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 everyone would have done something 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.010
 staff 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.890
 so it was really nice to watch at 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.900
 the end we all went live but 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.370
 all are motivated both 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 main 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.300
 and have fun 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.300
 it is this side 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.960
 the last 100 after the lay on was 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.690
 happy both sad it is to be 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.700
 finished it was really enriching his 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.130
 task is necessarily a group to which we 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 so is this sad and was leaving 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.590
 except with if we see every day 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.590
 it will be more like 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.739
 my 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.190
