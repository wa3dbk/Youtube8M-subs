00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
is the small version of the mask when he

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.029 
is the small version of the mask when he
starts<00:00:53.879> spinning<00:00:54.199> he<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> throws<00:00:55.800> off

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
starts spinning he kind of throws off

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
starts spinning he kind of throws off
part<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> his<00:00:56.399> case<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> turns<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.449> big

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
part of his case and turns into a big

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
part of his case and turns into a big
version<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> mask<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> look

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
version of the mask and if you look

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
version of the mask and if you look
closely<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> crack<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.590> his<00:01:01.770> mask<00:01:02.100> he's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
closely at the crack in his mask he's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
closely at the crack in his mask he's
got<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> bigger<00:01:02.910> version<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> mask<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
got a bigger version of the mask and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
got a bigger version of the mask and
there's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> crack<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.369> actually

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
there's a crack in it and it's actually

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.550 
there's a crack in it and it's actually
pulsating<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.229> closely

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pulsating so if you look really closely

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
pulsating so if you look really closely
the<00:01:08.130> cracks<00:01:08.880> pulsating<00:01:09.830> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
