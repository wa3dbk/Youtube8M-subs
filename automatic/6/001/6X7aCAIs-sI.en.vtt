00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
a problem with the security system and I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.850 
a problem with the security system and I
don't<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:41.990> see<00:00:42.990> if<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.170> lets<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.440> turn<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.740> off

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
don't know see if it lets me turn it off

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.000 
don't know see if it lets me turn it off
now

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
now

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.050 
now
now<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.040> see<00:00:49.010> it's<00:00:50.010> ridiculous<00:00:52.430> sim<00:00:53.430> Park<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
now I see it's ridiculous sim Park and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.850 
now I see it's ridiculous sim Park and
it<00:00:54.210> won't<00:00:54.390> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:55.070> take<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:57.800> now<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
it won't let me take it off now the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.070 
it won't let me take it off now the
battery<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> also<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.120> doing<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.570> well<00:01:00.600> today

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
battery is also not doing too well today

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.010 
battery is also not doing too well today
from<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> sounds<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:04.100> read<00:01:05.100> online<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
from the sounds of it I read online that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.179 
from the sounds of it I read online that
it<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.439> something<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
it could have something to do with that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.700 
it could have something to do with that
as<00:01:08.369> well<00:01:08.630> security<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.689> working<00:01:09.990> fine<00:01:10.170> now

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.319 

because<00:01:13.710> apparently<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.429> ass<00:01:14.759> Tech<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.149> not

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
because apparently my ass Tech is not

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.849 
because apparently my ass Tech is not
the<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.899> with<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.350> better

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
the only one with this better

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.760 
the only one with this better
ignition<00:01:17.429> problem<00:01:18.289> so<00:01:19.289> it's<00:01:19.499> either<00:01:19.649> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ignition problem so it's either the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.630 
ignition problem so it's either the
actual<00:01:21.590> brake<00:01:22.590> transmission<00:01:23.369> shift

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actual brake transmission shift

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
actual brake transmission shift
interlock<00:01:24.179> system<00:01:24.719> which<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.560> had<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> problem

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
interlock system which I had a problem

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.090 
interlock system which I had a problem
with<00:01:26.159> last<00:01:26.490> year<00:01:27.020> because<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.890> come

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
with last year because it would not come

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480 
with last year because it would not come
out<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.340> park<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.499> found<00:01:31.859> a<00:01:32.009> solution<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
out of park but I found a solution to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.080 
out of park but I found a solution to
get<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.880> fix<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.749> this<00:01:34.619> system<00:01:34.939> links<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
get to fix that and this system links to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.399 
get to fix that and this system links to
here<00:01:36.479> inside<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.759> ignition<00:01:38.759> system<00:01:39.409> because

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
here inside the ignition system because

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.779 
here inside the ignition system because
it<00:01:40.560> doesn't<00:01:40.859> want<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.069> to<00:01:41.130> turn<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.520> car<00:01:41.729> off

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
it doesn't want you to turn your car off

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.940 
it doesn't want you to turn your car off
or<00:01:42.270> take<00:01:42.719> your<00:01:42.869> key<00:01:43.049> out<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.380> your<00:01:43.530> car's<00:01:43.770> not

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
or take your key out if your car's not

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
or take your key out if your car's not
in<00:01:44.069> park<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.909> even<00:01:45.060> though<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.389> car<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
in park now even though my car is in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.300 
in park now even though my car is in
park<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:47.039> still<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.819> let<00:01:47.999> me

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
park it's still not going to let me

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.699 
park it's still not going to let me
remove<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.369> key<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> key<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.380> or

remove my key and when the key is on or
in<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.249> position<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> battery<00:01:54.659> is

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
in this position here the battery is

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.109 
in this position here the battery is
constantly<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:55.979> time

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
constantly on all the time

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.599 
constantly on all the time
so<00:02:01.439> we're<00:02:02.439> going<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.710> go<00:02:02.799> have<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:02.979> looked<00:02:03.219> at

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
so we're going to go have it looked at

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.160 
so we're going to go have it looked at
like<00:02:03.850> now<00:02:06.329> yeah<00:02:07.329> this<00:02:07.450> battery<00:02:07.869> sounds

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
like now yeah this battery sounds

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.690 
like now yeah this battery sounds
terrible<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.769> wonder<00:02:09.160> if<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.340> has<00:02:09.369> something<00:02:09.610> to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
terrible I wonder if it has something to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.039 
terrible I wonder if it has something to
do<00:02:09.819> with<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:12.910> go<00:02:13.060> find<00:02:13.300> out<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.870> we

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
do with that we will go find out what we

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:23.970 
do with that we will go find out what we
need<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.260> do<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> fixed<00:02:22.980> hopefully

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
need to do to get it fixed hopefully

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.880 
need to do to get it fixed hopefully
nothing<00:02:24.340> else<00:02:24.640> goes<00:02:24.849> wrong

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.850 

now<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.220> be<00:02:33.370> gas<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.810> very<00:02:35.500> uneasy

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
now we have to be gas and very uneasy

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.680 
now we have to be gas and very uneasy
about<00:02:36.129> leaving<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:37.060> an<00:02:37.330> ignition<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.360> can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
about leaving like an ignition but I can

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
about leaving like an ignition but I can
lock<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.989> doors<00:02:41.200> because<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.220> keyless

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
lock the doors because we have keyless

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.559 
lock the doors because we have keyless
entry<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.330> we<00:02:44.700> will<00:02:45.700> take<00:02:45.879> care<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.360> as

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
entry so we will take care of that as

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.960 
entry so we will take care of that as
well

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
well

on<00:04:16.280> peace<00:04:17.780> just<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.870> be<00:04:18.989> sure

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
on peace just to be sure

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.500 
on peace just to be sure
let's<00:04:19.560> start<00:04:19.770> it<00:04:19.890> again<00:04:20.010> as<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.270> test

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
let's start it again as like a test

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.460 
let's start it again as like a test
starts<00:04:24.510> up<00:04:24.630> better

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:47.860 

give<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.620> few<00:04:28.770> seconds<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:36.050> still<00:04:37.050> hear<00:04:37.259> it<00:04:37.289> I

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.199
