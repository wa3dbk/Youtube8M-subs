00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
start and I played two or three games

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.499 
start and I played two or three games
now<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> should<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.719> pretty<00:00:13.080> warmed<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:13.590> I

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
now so I should be pretty warmed up I

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.720 
now so I should be pretty warmed up I
just<00:00:15.509> had<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> game<00:00:15.929> players<00:00:16.260> like<00:00:16.550> 6215<00:00:17.550> I'm

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
just had a game players like 6215 I'm
not<00:00:17.880> sure<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.180> usable<00:00:18.770> because<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
not sure if it's usable because it was a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.810 
not sure if it's usable because it was a
bit<00:00:20.160> slow<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.109> my<00:00:22.109> team<00:00:22.619> were<00:00:22.920> idiots<00:00:23.220> as

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
bit slow and my team were idiots as

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.470 
bit slow and my team were idiots as
usual<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.119> again

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
usual but see how I do this again

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
usual but see how I do this again
because<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.619> want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> try<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> best

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
because I want to try to get the best

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.089 
because I want to try to get the best
game<00:00:29.490> plays<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:30.349> see<00:00:31.349> ya<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> hopefully
