out<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.240> stores<00:01:39.570> too<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:41.520> trying<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> new

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
out of stores too so I'm trying a new

out of stores too so I'm trying a new
matte<00:01:42.390> topcoat<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:44.450> overall<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.020> think

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
matte topcoat and overall I don't think

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.520 
matte topcoat and overall I don't think
it's<00:01:46.649> quite<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.789> mad<00:01:48.179> as<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.719> other<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it's quite as mad as the other two I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.529 
it's quite as mad as the other two I
mean<00:01:49.859> even<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> comes<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
mean even when it comes down to like

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.410 
mean even when it comes down to like
that<00:01:51.719> chalkboard<00:01:52.100> texture<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.149> quite

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that chalkboard texture it's not quite

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
that chalkboard texture it's not quite
the<00:01:54.450> same<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.770> certainly<00:01:56.039> gets<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.670> job

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the same but it certainly gets the job

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.469 
the same but it certainly gets the job
done<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.770> also<00:01:59.039> decided<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.850> apply<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> over

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
done and I also decided to apply it over

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.739 
done and I also decided to apply it over
the<00:02:00.689> fired<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.170> collection<00:02:01.859> and<00:02:02.299> on<00:02:03.299> these<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
the fired up collection and on these I

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.459 
the fired up collection and on these I
left<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.619> strip<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.159> each<00:02:05.429> one<00:02:06.079> glossy<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
left a strip of each one glossy so you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.080 
left a strip of each one glossy so you
can<00:02:07.890> hopefully<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.399> both<00:02:09.330> finishes<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.880> one
