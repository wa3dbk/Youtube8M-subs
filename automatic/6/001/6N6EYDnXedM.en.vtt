00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
with how she got to the point that she's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.309 
with how she got to the point that she's
currently<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.490> happens

currently at of what happens
a<00:02:24.409> little<00:02:24.859> bit<00:02:24.950> after<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.340> reading<00:02:26.150> this

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
a little bit after that reading this

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.910 
a little bit after that reading this
book<00:02:26.540> for<00:02:26.870> me<00:02:27.439> was<00:02:28.719> super<00:02:29.719> interesting<00:02:30.409> just

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
book for me was super interesting just

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.209 
book for me was super interesting just
because<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.459> giving<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.849> access<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.389> a<00:02:33.219> lot

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
because it was giving me access to a lot

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.660 
because it was giving me access to a lot
of<00:02:34.780> situations<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.260> ideas<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.400> aren't

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
of situations and ideas that aren't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.259 
of situations and ideas that aren't
necessarily<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.900> part<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.349> my<00:02:39.560> life<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.269> things

necessarily a part of my life and things

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.149 
necessarily a part of my life and things
that<00:02:41.389> I<00:02:41.510> don't<00:02:41.840> necessarily<00:02:42.439> think<00:02:42.469> about<00:02:42.769> on

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
that I don't necessarily think about on

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.580 
that I don't necessarily think about on
a<00:02:43.189> daily<00:02:43.519> basis<00:02:43.969> I<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:45.769> takes<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.280> into<00:02:46.519> both

Nigerian culture as well as American

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.550 
Nigerian culture as well as American

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.599 
culture and being from neither of those
places<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:56.120> lot<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.109> was<00:02:57.379> quite<00:02:58.040> foreign<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
places a lot of it was quite foreign to

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.899 
places a lot of it was quite foreign to
me<00:02:58.939> but<00:02:59.269> so<00:03:00.200> interesting<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.639> heart<00:03:01.819> of

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
me but so interesting at the heart of

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.970 
me but so interesting at the heart of
the<00:03:02.000> story<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.659> it's<00:03:03.139> very<00:03:03.290> much<00:03:03.409> a<00:03:03.500> personal

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the story is it's very much a personal

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.770 
the story is it's very much a personal
story<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.849> about<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:05.719> about

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
relationships it's about family dynamics

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.409 
relationships it's about family dynamics
it's<00:03:09.439> also<00:03:09.650> obviously<00:03:10.129> a<00:03:10.250> lot<00:03:10.519> about<00:03:10.699> race

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
it's also obviously a lot about race

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.159 
it's also obviously a lot about race
if<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.870> Malou<00:03:12.109> actually<00:03:12.769> runs<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.969> blog<00:03:14.689> in

I found the blogging aspects super

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.729 
I found the blogging aspects super
interesting<00:03:22.909> but<00:03:23.209> her<00:03:23.510> blog<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:24.049> actually

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
interesting but her blog is actually

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.699 
interesting but her blog is actually
about<00:03:25.400> race<00:03:25.909> it's<00:03:26.329> about<00:03:26.359> American<00:03:26.989> ideas<00:03:27.349> of

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
about race it's about American ideas of

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.830 
about race it's about American ideas of
black<00:03:28.189> culture<00:03:28.699> and<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.419> differences

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
black culture and the differences

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.110 
black culture and the differences

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
and how that can differ vastly between

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.460 
and how that can differ vastly between

and<00:03:46.069> their<00:03:46.220> upbringing<00:03:46.430> there<00:03:47.359> was<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:47.810> couple

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
and their upbringing there was a couple

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.860 
and their upbringing there was a couple
of<00:03:48.319> darker<00:03:49.310> moments<00:03:49.639> in<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.239> novel<00:03:50.629> that<00:03:50.810> I

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
of darker moments in this novel that I

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.229 
of darker moments in this novel that I
wasn't<00:03:51.439> necessarily<00:03:51.819> expecting<00:03:52.819> there<00:03:53.150> are<00:03:53.209> a

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
wasn't necessarily expecting there are a

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.490 
wasn't necessarily expecting there are a
couple<00:03:53.389> of<00:03:53.569> occurrences<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.109> are<00:03:54.259> quite

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
couple of occurrences that are quite

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.229 
couple of occurrences that are quite
jarring<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:55.280> happened<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.790> various

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
jarring that happened to various

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.390 
jarring that happened to various
characters<00:03:56.810> throughout<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.680> novel<00:03:58.009> I<00:03:58.280> think

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
characters throughout the novel I think

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.089 
characters throughout the novel I think
the<00:03:58.759> thing<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.299> I<00:03:59.329> enjoyed<00:03:59.810> most<00:04:00.379> about<00:04:00.709> this

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
the thing that I enjoyed most about this

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.849 
the thing that I enjoyed most about this
book<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.639> just<00:04:02.650> how<00:04:04.810> believable<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:06.259> was<00:04:06.530> I

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
book is just how believable it was I

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.080 
book is just how believable it was I
felt<00:04:07.219> that<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.699> writing<00:04:08.150> was<00:04:08.419> just<00:04:08.449> so<00:04:10.090> honest

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
felt that the writing was just so honest

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.089 
felt that the writing was just so honest
I<00:04:11.359> just<00:04:11.419> really<00:04:11.719> felt<00:04:12.379> like<00:04:12.469> I<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:12.709> there<00:04:12.949> with

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
I just really felt like I was there with

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.679 
I just really felt like I was there with
the<00:04:13.219> characters<00:04:13.759> I<00:04:13.879> felt<00:04:14.090> like<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.299> was<00:04:14.419> getting

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
the characters I felt like I was getting

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.439 
the characters I felt like I was getting
to<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:15.169> them<00:04:15.439> it<00:04:16.009> was<00:04:16.190> very<00:04:16.219> much<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:17.030> spans

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
to know them it was very much it spans

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.180 
to know them it was very much it spans
like<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> decent<00:04:18.229> period<00:04:18.409> of<00:04:18.620> time<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.070> it's

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
like a decent period of time so it's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.939 
like a decent period of time so it's
quite<00:04:19.370> an<00:04:19.639> epic<00:04:20.180> novel<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.289> sense<00:04:21.680> and

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
quite an epic novel in that sense and

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.339 
quite an epic novel in that sense and
it's<00:04:22.159> similar<00:04:22.909> to<00:04:23.090> other<00:04:23.539> things<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.320> I

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
it's similar to other things that I

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.909 
it's similar to other things that I
really<00:04:24.740> enjoy<00:04:25.449> like<00:04:26.449> The<00:04:27.349> Cider<00:04:27.530> House<00:04:27.800> Rules
