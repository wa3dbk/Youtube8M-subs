00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 after their deserved qualification against the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 fc Zurich in the final of the women's 16th 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.379
 champions league 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 fcf juvisy tries to get ready 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.240
 now to face the next round 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 the norwegian club of stabaek f 15 a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 task that does not look so simple 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.430
 in the Scandinavian team created the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.140
 surprise at the previous round of the judges 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.429
 However, visuals have the potential to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 reach the quarterfinals of the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.779
 most prestigious competitions 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.779
 European 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.840
 the biggest competition as long as there is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.800
 is 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.970
 it's the biggest competition 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.970
 brings together the best clubs 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.960
 I think that 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.930
 world since we see 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 these teams 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.290
 too expensive 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.040
 and so simple and fizi 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.040
 6 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.550
 we state of mind is win so 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.670
 go inside 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.090
 I won everything 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 the state of mind will change m 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 safeguarding our world from the blow and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.120
 in mind it's even more 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.950
 the competitors and 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 goal is to pass the eighth g 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.480
 mitch m 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.920
 to fetch 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.909
 last case the list goes on so 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.909
 qualified 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.690
 you can do and that's it 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 Why 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.100
 anyway to them 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.240
 I think on the bench of the ace of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.250
 things to click to do the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 difference so anyway 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 yes I think anything 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 to enter little 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.189
 bah already the eleven to spend his 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.430
 choice of the coach after that is true 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.490
 on the bench 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.640
 that we were more staff 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.319
 your qualities already last year I 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.110
 think that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.040
 you do not pay 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.330
 it can be that peillon of any 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.430
 way 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 after that depends on the thing that comes 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 and his envy 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.280
 what time on the pitch do you pay 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.280
 the choice of the coach so I think that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.330
 but we know that on the bench we have 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.170
 players 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:40.570
 able me personally I think that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.560
 he's a dangerous opponent but he 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.290
 is not known 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.280
 but I think that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.280
 he created the water surprise 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.340
 the team yes I think that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.459
 of that 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 well who may not have it who did 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.910
 his little way sounded 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.260
 Nordic pool club so we know that 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.340
 knew the nature very hard physically 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 think if she is here today 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.920
 it's not points 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.270
 and that on a match everything can be played 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.910
 as in France cup small 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.160
 teams 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.880
 I am then 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 but 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.170
 your presence and our strength 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.980
 Yes
