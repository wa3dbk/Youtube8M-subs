want to take the little smaller

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.110 
want to take the little smaller
screwdrivers<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.290> showed<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.560> earlier

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
screwdrivers that I showed you earlier

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
screwdrivers that I showed you earlier
of<00:02:33.120> course<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.390> want<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:34.080> able<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> pinch

these in and then pry up around this
piece<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.110> comes<00:02:40.319> out<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:41.099> such<00:02:42.620> then

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
piece then it comes out like such then

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.809 
piece then it comes out like such then
the<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:45.000> plastic<00:02:45.209> rivet<00:02:45.750> goes<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.980> so

the expansion tank towards the rear of
the<00:03:17.730> car<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.530> won't<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.830> able<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.129> it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the car now you won't be able to get it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.540 
the car now you won't be able to get it
completely<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.750> because<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:22.050> how<00:03:22.739> tight<00:03:23.370> it

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
completely out because of how tight it

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.420 
completely out because of how tight it
is<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:24.110> but<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.620> able<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.010> raise<00:03:26.190> up

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
is here but you will be able to raise up

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.940 
is here but you will be able to raise up
on<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.790> expansion<00:03:27.420> tank<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.650> shroud

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
on the expansion tank and the shroud

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.270 
on the expansion tank and the shroud
enough<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:31.080> get<00:03:31.230> access<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:34.280> coolant

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
enough to get access to the coolant

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.100 
enough to get access to the coolant
level<00:03:35.670> sensor<00:03:36.409> there<00:03:38.239> now<00:03:39.239> when<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.599> raise<00:03:39.810> up

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
level sensor there now when you raise up

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.820 
level sensor there now when you raise up
on<00:03:40.260> both<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.790> clearance<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.209> need

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
on both you have the clearance you need

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.080 
on both you have the clearance you need
just<00:03:43.830> keep<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.190> mind<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.670> when<00:03:44.819> you<00:03:44.909> get

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
just keep in mind that when you get

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.280 
just keep in mind that when you get
ready<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.450> remove<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:47.459> want<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.730> remove<00:03:48.000> it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
ready to remove it you want to remove it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.070 
ready to remove it you want to remove it
so<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.680> sensor<00:03:50.239> will<00:03:51.239> come<00:03:51.450> out<00:03:51.629> going

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
so that the sensor will come out going

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170 
so that the sensor will come out going
towards<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.560> inside<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.400> radiator<00:03:53.879> hose

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
towards the inside of that radiator hose

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.770 
towards the inside of that radiator hose
not<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.349> outside<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:57.090> easier<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.720> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
not the outside it's easier for it to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.490 
not the outside it's easier for it to
come<00:03:57.959> out<00:03:57.989> going<00:03:58.349> towards<00:03:58.769> the<00:04:00.230> inside<00:04:01.230> of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
come out going towards the inside of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.839 
come out going towards the inside of
your<00:04:02.480> lower<00:04:03.480> radiator<00:04:03.900> hose<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.730> then<00:04:05.730> you

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
your lower radiator hose and then you

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.250 
your lower radiator hose and then you
just<00:04:06.030> put<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.269> together<00:04:06.360> in<00:04:06.689> reverse<00:04:06.989> and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
just put it together in reverse and

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.610 
just put it together in reverse and
pretty<00:04:08.099> much<00:04:08.340> that's<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.319> I'm<00:04:10.379> going<00:04:10.560> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
pretty much that's it so I'm going to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.259 
pretty much that's it so I'm going to
button<00:04:10.890> everything<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:11.939> the<00:04:12.120> next

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269

everything is back together the only
thing<00:04:54.830> that's<00:04:55.009> left<00:04:55.069> is<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:56.650> bleed<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.979> air

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
thing that's left is to bleed the air

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.089 
thing that's left is to bleed the air
out<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> system<00:04:58.699> so<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.539> heat<00:04:59.719> works<00:05:00.099> but

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
out of the system so the heat works but

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.100 
out of the system so the heat works but
I<00:05:01.129> wanted<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.580> take<00:05:01.729> a<00:05:01.759> look<00:05:01.939> at<00:05:02.090> my<00:05:02.300> own

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
signal so make sure that the wire on the

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.330 
signal so make sure that the wire on the
sensor<00:06:43.629> is

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
sensor is

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.739 
sensor is
corny<00:06:47.980> awesome
