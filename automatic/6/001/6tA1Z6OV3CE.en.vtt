made by nzg and 150th scale this is a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.849 
made by nzg and 150th scale this is a
little<00:00:14.429> bit<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.820> older<00:00:15.210> model<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.859> imagined

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
little bit of an older model I imagined

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.390 
little bit of an older model I imagined
it<00:00:17.430> came<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.880> either<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> 80s

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
it came out either in the 80s

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
it came out either in the 80s
I'm<00:00:20.400> guessing<00:00:20.850> sometime<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> 80s<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:21.900> I'm

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'm guessing sometime in the 80s but I'm

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740 
I'm guessing sometime in the 80s but I'm
not<00:00:22.199> real<00:00:22.439> sure<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:23.150> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.660> an

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
not real sure as you can see it's an

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.509 
not real sure as you can see it's an
articulated<00:00:25.320> dump<00:00:25.500> truck<00:00:25.740> six<00:00:26.070> wheel<00:00:26.250> dump

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
to a fairly tight turn it rolls nicely

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the mirrors here you can see those are

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.630 
the mirrors here you can see those are
plastic<00:01:18.049> there<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.770> plastic<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
plastic there is very little plastic the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
plastic there is very little plastic the

the front parts the grille and these
little<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:25.049> they're<00:01:25.229> light<00:01:25.439> protectors

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
little I think they're light protectors

rubber with plastic rims
there<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> multi-stage<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> four

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
there is a multi-stage actually a four

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.249 
there is a multi-stage actually a four

the<00:01:40.439> body<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.600> don't<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.990> many<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> real

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the body you don't see many of the real

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.200 
the body you don't see many of the real
machines<00:01:44.040> around<00:01:44.369> anymore<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:44.880> most<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
machines around anymore because most of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
machines around anymore because most of
them<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.420> been<00:01:45.479> scrapped<00:01:45.930> they're<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
them have been scrapped they're kind of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.960 
them have been scrapped they're kind of
hard<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.640> parts<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.939> they've<00:01:50.939> really

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
hard to get parts for so they've really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.010 
hard to get parts for so they've really
gone<00:01:51.540> away<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> third-world<00:01:54.479> countries

gone away the third-world countries

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.209 
gone away the third-world countries
still<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.290> them<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:55.979> countries

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

are<00:02:28.340> plastic<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> they<00:02:29.850> they<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.780> time<00:02:31.230> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
are plastic and they they do time to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.780 
are plastic and they they do time to
slide<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.770> little<00:02:31.950> bit<00:02:34.490> sometimes<00:02:35.490> they<00:02:35.670> don't

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
slide a little bit sometimes they don't

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.100 
slide a little bit sometimes they don't
really<00:02:36.060> want<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.300> work<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> can

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
really want to work all the way you can

see<00:02:37.320> they<00:02:37.500> don't<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:39.000> don't<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.810> down

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
see they don't they don't go up and down

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.280 
see they don't they don't go up and down
the<00:02:40.200> best<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.930> overall<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.280> nice<00:02:44.459> piece<00:02:44.730> I

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the best but overall it's a nice piece I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
the best but overall it's a nice piece I
think<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.410> paid<00:02:46.650> somewhere<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
think I paid somewhere in the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.080 
think I paid somewhere in the
neighborhood<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.700> $60<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.840> one<00:02:50.060> not<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
neighborhood of $60 for this one not a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.540 
neighborhood of $60 for this one not a
bad<00:02:51.360> price<00:02:51.739> could<00:02:52.739> be<00:02:52.800> better<00:02:53.100> could<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.400> worse

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
bad price could be better could be worse

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.890 
bad price could be better could be worse
there<00:02:54.420> again<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.050> side<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.530> mirror<00:02:58.459> frame

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
there again this side the mirror frame

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.000 
there again this side the mirror frame
it's<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> severe<00:03:01.739> angle<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> frame

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it's got a severe angle to the frame

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
it's got a severe angle to the frame
that's<00:03:05.010> how<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.310> were<00:03:05.370> made

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
that's how they were made

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.320 
that's how they were made
put<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> body<00:03:07.530> back<00:03:07.680> down<00:03:08.239> there's<00:03:09.239> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
put the body back down there's a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.840 
put the body back down there's a
tailgate<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.410> back<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:11.010> two-piece

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
tailgate on the back a two-piece

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.449 
tailgate on the back a two-piece
tailgate<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.670> part<00:03:15.000> flips<00:03:15.330> down<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:17.010> flips

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
tailgate that part flips down that flips

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.770 
tailgate that part flips down that flips
up<00:03:17.730> whatever<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.570> body<00:03:18.930> goes<00:03:19.320> up<00:03:20.780> whatever

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
up whatever the body goes up whatever

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.630 
up whatever the body goes up whatever
goes<00:03:22.170> down<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.950> think<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
goes down it's like that I think they

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
goes down it's like that I think they
tried<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.910> simulate<00:03:27.239> some<00:03:28.370> rear<00:03:29.370> lights<00:03:30.269> in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
tried to simulate some rear lights in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.630 
tried to simulate some rear lights in
the<00:03:30.870> back<00:03:31.080> here<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.010> only<00:03:32.370> part

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the back here and that's the only part

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
of the model that I really don't like I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.940 
of the model that I really don't like I
don't<00:03:34.410> care<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:36.140> I'm<00:03:37.140> not<00:03:37.200> exactly<00:03:37.650> sure

don't care for it I'm not exactly sure
what<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.400> did<00:03:38.640> or<00:03:38.790> why<00:03:39.120> they<00:03:39.420> did<00:03:39.660> that
