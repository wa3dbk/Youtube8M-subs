not<00:00:11.280> much<00:00:11.460> really<00:00:11.730> has<00:00:12.000> evolved<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.750> this

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
not much really has evolved from this

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.440 
not much really has evolved from this
device<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.530> had<00:00:13.710> about<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> week<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:15.059> ponder

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
device I had about a week to to ponder

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.529 
device I had about a week to to ponder
on<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.900> come<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.539> techniques

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
on it and come up with some techniques

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.720 
on it and come up with some techniques
to<00:00:18.630> maybe<00:00:18.930> increase<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> production<00:00:19.980> using

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
to maybe increase the production using

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
to maybe increase the production using
the<00:00:20.910> existing<00:00:21.119> set<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.650> I've<00:00:22.769> done

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the existing set up and what I've done

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.429 
the existing set up and what I've done
is<00:00:24.350> for<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> couple<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.740> suggestions<00:00:26.160> from

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
is for a couple of suggestions from

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.980 
is for a couple of suggestions from
YouTube<00:00:28.439> users<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.789> incorporated<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
YouTube users it has incorporated a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.959 
YouTube users it has incorporated a
screen<00:00:32.300> between<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:34.219> tubes<00:00:35.219> acrylic

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
screen between the two tubes acrylic

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
screen between the two tubes acrylic
tubes<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.829> did<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.420> allows<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
tubes and what that did was allows me to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.220 
tubes and what that did was allows me to
increase<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.739> gap<00:00:41.480> between<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:42.989> tubes

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
increase the gap between the two tubes

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.090 
increase the gap between the two tubes
from<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> previous<00:00:44.390> 1/8<00:00:45.390> by<00:00:45.809> 3/8<00:00:46.469> inch<00:00:46.770> long

from the previous 1/8 by 3/8 inch long
vertical<00:00:47.640> slot<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.010> believe

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
vertical slot to now which I believe

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:00.819 
vertical slot to now which I believe
measures<00:00:52.190> 3/16<00:00:53.600> by<00:00:55.399> 3/4<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.610> inch<00:00:56.730> tall<00:00:57.149> so

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.189 

on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> screen<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.399> using<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.059> plastic<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
on the screen I'm using is plastic it is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.179 
on the screen I'm using is plastic it is
not<00:01:04.439> aluminum<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.159> stainless<00:01:05.869> it's<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
not aluminum or stainless it's just a

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
not aluminum or stainless it's just a
piece<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> scrap<00:01:08.640> ahead<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.299> rescreening<00:01:10.170> a

piece of scrap ahead from rescreening a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.920 
piece of scrap ahead from rescreening a
few<00:01:10.500> windows<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> few<00:01:11.159> years<00:01:11.369> ago<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
few windows a few years ago and the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
few windows a few years ago and the
thought<00:01:13.110> i'd<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> idea<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.189> see

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
thought i'd go with this idea and see

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
thought i'd go with this idea and see
what<00:01:14.580> happens<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:15.330> can't<00:01:15.630> increase<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what happens if i can't increase the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
what happens if i can't increase the
production<00:01:17.299> without<00:01:18.299> increasing<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
production without increasing the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
production without increasing the
solution<00:01:19.770> concentration<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.570> got

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
solution concentration now what I've got

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
solution concentration now what I've got
here<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:25.970> I've<00:01:26.970> got<00:01:27.030> my<00:01:27.420> negative<00:01:28.350> lead<00:01:28.670> here

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
here is I've got my negative lead here

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
here is I've got my negative lead here
and<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.270> positive<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:30.960> I'll<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.200> my

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and this is my positive so I'll get my

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 
and this is my positive so I'll get my
oxygen<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.369> tube<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
oxygen from this tube and then the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
oxygen from this tube and then the
hydrogen<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> course<00:01:34.470> again<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> last

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
hydrogen of course again like the last

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.420 
hydrogen of course again like the last
video<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:38.990> am<00:01:39.990> using<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.560> 12<00:01:41.250> volt

next<00:01:59.759> year<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.090> using<00:02:00.329> lye<00:02:00.990> excuse<00:02:01.710> me

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
next year I'm using lye excuse me

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.620 
next year I'm using lye excuse me
potassium<00:02:03.509> hydroxide<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> did<00:02:04.979> before

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
potassium hydroxide just as I did before

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.770 
potassium hydroxide just as I did before
the<00:02:06.930> mixture<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.670> approximately<00:02:08.670> four<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the mixture is approximately four to one

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.660 
the mixture is approximately four to one
ratio<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:11.780> three<00:02:12.780> parts<00:02:13.080> being<00:02:13.670> filtered

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
ratio for three parts being filtered

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.350 
ratio for three parts being filtered
water<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:16.260> other<00:02:16.290> part<00:02:16.650> being<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
water and the other part being the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.320 
water and the other part being the
potassium<00:02:18.360> hydroxide<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:21.000> guess<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
potassium hydroxide so it is I guess a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.230 
potassium hydroxide so it is I guess a
fairly<00:02:21.750> strong<00:02:22.230> solution<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.880> let's<00:02:24.120> go

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
fairly strong solution and let's go

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.550 
fairly strong solution and let's go
ahead<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.510> flip<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.750> switch<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.350> what<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
ahead and flip the switch and see what I

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.210 
ahead and flip the switch and see what I
got<00:02:25.740> here<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:28.080> oh<00:02:28.380> wow<00:02:28.680> that's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
got here and oh wow that's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760 
got here and oh wow that's
oh<00:02:29.340> that's<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.300> nice<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.780> hope<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.560> see

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
oh that's really nice I hope you can see

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.230 
oh that's really nice I hope you can see
this<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.550> zoom<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.940> without

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
this and so I can zoom in without

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.949 
this and so I can zoom in without
getting<00:02:33.480> too<00:02:33.630> fuzzy<00:02:35.450> okay<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.780> one

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
getting too fuzzy okay I do you have one

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.660 
getting too fuzzy okay I do you have one
concern<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> concede<00:02:38.370> or<00:02:38.490> not

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
concern I don't like to concede or not

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
concern I don't like to concede or not
but<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.480> seems<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.200> lot<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:40.680> production

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
but it seems to be a lot more production

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.610 
but it seems to be a lot more production
going<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.840> near<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.870> base<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> two

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
going on near the base of the two

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.000 
going on near the base of the two
electrodes<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:44.910> I'm<00:02:45.090> thinking<00:02:45.570> maybe<00:02:46.010> it's

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
electrodes but I'm thinking maybe it's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.900 
electrodes but I'm thinking maybe it's
kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.250> hard<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.489> tell<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.730> could<00:02:50.880> be

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
kind of hard to tell but there could be

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
kind of hard to tell but there could be
some<00:02:51.470> contamination<00:02:52.520> going<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.640> here<00:02:54.650> meaning

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
some contamination going on here meaning

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.830 
some contamination going on here meaning
maybe<00:02:55.830> some<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> gases<00:02:56.459> could<00:02:56.910> be<00:02:57.060> flowing

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
maybe some of the gases could be flowing

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.199 
maybe some of the gases could be flowing
from<00:02:58.019> one<00:02:58.200> tube<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.800> other<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> don't<00:02:59.250> on

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
from one tube to the other I don't on

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.810 
from one tube to the other I don't on
video<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.989> looks<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.500> may<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:02.070> hop

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
video it looks like there may be but hop

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.540 
video it looks like there may be but hop
video<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.209> don't<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.630> don't<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.230> um<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.400> yeah

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
video I don't I don't see it um but yeah

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.479 
video I don't I don't see it um but yeah
my<00:03:05.730> guess<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.330> possible<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.160> don't<00:03:08.160> see

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
my guess this is possible I don't see

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.850 
my guess this is possible I don't see
here<00:03:08.640> maybe<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.000> could<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:12.590> don't<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.739> think

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
here maybe I could I don't know I think

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.600 
here maybe I could I don't know I think
that<00:03:14.100> screen<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.610> diffusing<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.330> quite<00:03:15.570> well

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
that screen is diffusing it quite well

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.140 
that screen is diffusing it quite well
and<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.930> production<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:20.150> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
and as you can see the production is is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.050 
and as you can see the production is is
much<00:03:21.420> better<00:03:21.600> than<00:03:21.989> previous<00:03:22.170> video<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:23.060> am

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
much better than previous video I am

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.690 
much better than previous video I am
running<00:03:24.269> at<00:03:26.959> looks<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.170> -<00:03:28.650> oh<00:03:28.980> wow<00:03:29.340> almost

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
running at looks like - oh wow almost

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
running at looks like - oh wow almost
four<00:03:29.910> amps<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.360> time<00:03:30.600> before<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.799> believe<00:03:32.340> is

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
four amps this time before I believe is

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.229 
four amps this time before I believe is
about<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:33.209> was<00:03:33.329> almost<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:34.100> maybe<00:03:35.100> 750<00:03:35.940> ml

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
about it was almost one in maybe 750 ml

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.120 
about it was almost one in maybe 750 ml
amps<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.989> than<00:03:40.110> doubled<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
amps and the more than doubled it the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.180 
amps and the more than doubled it the
current<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.640> across<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.150> two<00:03:43.190> threaded

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
current going across the two threaded

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.080 
current going across the two threaded
rods<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.850> oh<00:03:45.060> wow<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.890> producing<00:03:47.280> nicely

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.360 

I<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:50.959> I'm<00:03:51.019> going<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.349> next<00:03:51.560> is

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.030 

maybe<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:57.550> few<00:03:58.550> adjustments<00:03:59.800> regarding<00:04:00.800> the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
maybe a few adjustments regarding the

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.570 
maybe a few adjustments regarding the
size<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> gap<00:04:02.209> between<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.599> two<00:04:02.840> tubes<00:04:03.080> I

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
size of the gap between the two tubes I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.830 
size of the gap between the two tubes I
think<00:04:04.580> maybe<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.120> increase<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.750> little

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
think maybe I can increase that a little

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.860 
think maybe I can increase that a little
bit<00:04:06.170> more<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:07.040> may<00:04:07.250> even<00:04:07.390> increase<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.420> gap

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
bit more and I may even increase the gap

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.809 
bit more and I may even increase the gap
between<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.470> two<00:04:09.620> electrodes<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.340> think<00:04:10.610> I

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
between the two electrodes I think I

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.479 
between the two electrodes I think I
think<00:04:11.599> now<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.810> I've<00:04:12.140> got<00:04:12.379> more<00:04:12.920> solution

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
think now that I've got more solution

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.009 
think now that I've got more solution
running<00:04:13.819> through<00:04:14.000> there<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.569> course<00:04:14.599> more

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
running through there and of course more

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.199 
running through there and of course more
current<00:04:15.440> now<00:04:15.560> running<00:04:15.950> through<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:17.030> two

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
current now running through the two

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.170 
current now running through the two
tubes<00:04:17.449> that<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.199> can<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.799> can<00:04:19.100> space<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.760> threads

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
tubes that I can I can space the threads

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.120 
tubes that I can I can space the threads
threaded<00:04:20.870> rods<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.350> little<00:04:21.590> bit<00:04:21.709> further<00:04:21.949> apart

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
threaded rods a little bit further apart

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.990 
threaded rods a little bit further apart
and<00:04:23.470> leaving<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.650> potential<00:04:25.160> contamination<00:04:25.700> of

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
and leaving a potential contamination of

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500 
and leaving a potential contamination of

the two but anyway just wanted to give
