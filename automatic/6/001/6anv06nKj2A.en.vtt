00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.480
 the fact that now the engines will not be 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.190
 will not be registered 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
 as a result, the numbers on the engines will not be 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.719
 register with the traffic police for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.110
 I actually had some such 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 news that is, I do not remember to 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.320
 inflamed to this struggle for it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.060
 deliver us engines calmly to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.029
 we can cancel it and other such 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.710
 of course there was no why they didn't do it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 I know maybe we took the path of Russia 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 which canceled it not too long ago 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.250
 but also they canceled in my opinion any 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.270
 simplifying the communication of motorists 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 the traffic police have a plus the less we 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 we will dock with them including 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 The reason for the questions was all kinds of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 Registrations are generally better. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 engine of course this is this spare it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.809
 large main but still parts 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 so I am free with my spare 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 I want to do what I want 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 I want to make out I wanted to throw out 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.710
 Here it is in my opinion in general, it is not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.410
 bad not bad what engine number 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 optional cabin identification cars 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.240
 did in case of theft there 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.440
 I do not know how much this traffic police 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.910
 I helped, I think that is not very 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.490
 since they are so calm about it 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.830
 so, well, thank God I donâ€™t 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 I think that there will be a mass situation when 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.770
 people will start tossing and stuff 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.500
 rather no more likely no single yes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.680
 and this in general to can of course allow 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.200
 these people 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.990
 pay for the engine which stood 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.210
 initially use the engine 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.350
 who stood over men since u 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.290
 Our tax is tied to the volume here 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.260
 some sort of loophole turns out 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.670
 because on 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.480
 1 reconciliation of engine number will not be anywhere 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 here visually at a sight to define 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.760
 Of course the specialist can watch 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.530
 how many cylinders and so on but no one is 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.450
 no one does this 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 check therefore theoretically can 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.500
 be up to you car originally 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.810
 manufacturer released with a volume of 2 liters 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.069
 you want to put there four or 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 five or ten 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.950
 here put nobody pay nothing 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.129
 tax you have 2 liters theoretically 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.129
 it is possible
