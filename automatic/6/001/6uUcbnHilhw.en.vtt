00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.210
 you know me the mystery helped seriously 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
 transform 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 I grew up in a family where my father is extremely 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 negative about many things he 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.859
 believed that the rich all robbed 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 he believed that everyone who has money 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.019
 I was deceived as a child I believed that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.920
 if you have money it means you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.529
 bad man 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.630
 money only from evil people that money on 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 trees do not grow and would still be so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 cool phrase i'm what do you think rockefeller 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.350
 so I grew up sincerely believe that life 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.329
 hard that you have to fight all the time and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.739
 only after meeting with customer Stone 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.739
 my life began to change 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 once he said 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.110
 set a goal like that 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.360
 achievement will be for you shocks I 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.710
 I taught you how to do it I believe that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.950
 you will reach it well and at this time I 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.080
 earned 8 thousand dollars a year and mine 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.030
 desire was modest enough i 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.070
 answered I want to earn 100,000 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.810
 dollars a year I could not even imagine 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.520
 I didn't have any idea how to do it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.800
 impossible strategies 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 but I said I will believe and act 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.830
 as if this happens and emit during 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 impulse universe i did so among 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.440
 other things he taught me every day 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 closes eyes and visualize goals 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.300
 as if they were reached and i drew 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 bill of 100,000 dollars and attached it 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.440
 on the ceiling to wake up in the morning 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.470
 look up and she reminds 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.900
 me about my aspiration after that i 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.190
 closed his eyes and imagined his life 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.890
 with such an income of 100 thousand dollars 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.930
 but in 30 days in my life did not happen 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 no major events 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.659
 no one offered me more money and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.150
 here all of a sudden in the shower later 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.369
 four weeks I got the idea for 100 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.800
 thousand dollars i by then wrote 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.649
 book and told myself if sell all 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.070
 circulation of 25 cents per piece will be 100,000 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.239
 dollars the book was ready but this thought 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.400
 didn't occur to me 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.270
 so when it comes to you 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.320
 inspired thought she needs to trust and 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.239
 I didn't know how to produce 400000 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.160
 copies of my book we are not so 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.480
 did and then I saw the magazine national 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.700
 and fire 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.160
 I knew him but for me he was on 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.470
 backyard and here he was in front of me and I 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.310
 wondered if people would find out about my 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.800
 book 400,000 would definitely go and buy a 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
 a month later I spoke hunter college in 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.200
 New York and I was approached alone at home and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.480
 said i would like to interview you 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 here is my business card I asked for what 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.420
 editions most of the materials i 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.900
 I'm typing in national 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.900
 in clear 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.770
 and in my head the music from 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.300
 twilight zone 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.200
 this system really works 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.690
 magazine published an article and book sales 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.710
 increased dramatically I want to say that I 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 himself drew his life these events 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:19.280
 well, in general, in short that year I am 100 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.740
 thousand did not work we got 92 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.600
 thousand three hundred and twenty seven dollars you 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.300
 think we began to say this system is not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.310
 working no we said amazingly 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.980
 and my wife said if the system works 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 at 100 thousand work for a million i 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.300
 answered do not know let's try and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.730
 the moment came when my publisher 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.220
 paid me a fee for a book chicken 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.110
 soup for the soul and painted a smiley because 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.010
 that it was the first person in a million 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.950
 which he wrote out so i'm on myself 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.280
 made sure the mystery was working we had 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.670
 the test worked on all 100 of this 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.390
 thought i live every day of my life i 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.390
 I can take
