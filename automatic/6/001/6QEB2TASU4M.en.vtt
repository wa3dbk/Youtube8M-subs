00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of whether it's a drugstore or a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.120 
of whether it's a drugstore or a
high-end<00:00:12.750> brand<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.320> think<00:00:13.349> makeup<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.889> still

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
high-end brand I think makeup is still

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
high-end brand I think makeup is still
fairly<00:00:14.880> expensive<00:00:15.330> lace<00:00:15.719> not<00:00:15.870> something<00:00:16.139> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
fairly expensive lace not something that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260 
fairly expensive lace not something that
you<00:00:16.350> necessarily<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.490> more<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.060> you

kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> bit<00:00:33.090> over<00:00:33.300> obsessive<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
kind of get a bit over obsessive and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.330 
kind of get a bit over obsessive and
just<00:00:34.020> purchase<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.469> whole<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.219> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
just purchase a whole lot of it which is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
just purchase a whole lot of it which is
why<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.809> these

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
why I have a lot of these and these

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
why I have a lot of these and these
weren't<00:00:37.500> gifted<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> did<00:00:38.309> purchases<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> they

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
weren't gifted I did purchases and they

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
weren't gifted I did purchases and they
I<00:00:40.200> find<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.860> quite<00:00:41.219> expensive<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I find them to be quite expensive the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
I find them to be quite expensive the
$22<00:00:42.660> each<00:00:42.780> retail<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.890> Australia<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
$22 each retail in Australia but I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
$22 each retail in Australia but I
purchased<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.719> were<00:00:45.780> 50%<00:00:46.140> off

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
purchased these when they were 50% off

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.869 
purchased these when they were 50% off
at<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.610> chemist<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.180> these<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.660> $12<00:00:49.879> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
at my chemist so these are about $12 but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
at my chemist so these are about $12 but
yet<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.690> purchases<00:00:52.140> over<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> year<00:00:52.890> ago<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
yet I did purchases over a year ago so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
yet I did purchases over a year ago so
they're<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.610> exactly<00:00:54.180> new<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> time

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
they're not exactly new and at the time

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.400 
they're not exactly new and at the time
then<00:00:56.010> fell<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:56.910> foolproof

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
then fell pretty much my foolproof

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.689 
then fell pretty much my foolproof
fallback<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> came<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.190> special

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
fallback when it came to really special

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639 
fallback when it came to really special
occasions<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.570> wedding<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.500> they

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
occasions like my wedding because they

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
occasions like my wedding because they
did<00:01:01.859> last<00:01:02.129> quite<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> long<00:01:02.640> time<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> was

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
did last quite a long time and it was

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
did last quite a long time and it was
like<00:01:03.510> nothing<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.320> ever<00:01:04.350> tried<00:01:04.830> before<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like nothing I've ever tried before so I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.219 
like nothing I've ever tried before so I
was<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.090> impressed<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
was really impressed at how long it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.859 
was really impressed at how long it
actually<00:01:07.470> stayed<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> product<00:01:09.330> does<00:01:09.570> say

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
actually stayed and the product does say

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
actually stayed and the product does say
it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> 24<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> 24<00:01:11.820> hours<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's a 24 it's up to 24 hours but I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.380 
it's a 24 it's up to 24 hours but I
don't<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.350> it'll<00:01:13.530> last<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.979> long<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.189> think

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
don't think it'll last that long I think

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
don't think it'll last that long I think
mostly<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.509> 8<00:01:16.020> hours<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:16.860> good

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
mostly about 8 hours then you're good

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
mostly about 8 hours then you're good
but<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> find<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.540> whether

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but what I find I don't know whether

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.380 
but what I find I don't know whether
it's<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> me<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.070> find<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> ends<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's just me but I find that the ends of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's just me but I find that the ends of
it<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> wear<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.820> they're<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.970> bad

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it kind of wear out more they're as bad

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.280 
it kind of wear out more they're as bad
as<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.420> could<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.200> like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
as they could be because I just like

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
as they could be because I just like
rubbing<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.799> face<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.280> something<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.790> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
rubbing my face or something like that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
rubbing my face or something like that
but<00:01:27.450> basically<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.080> product<00:01:28.320> has<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.400> two

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
but basically the product has it has two

this is pretty much the color of the
product<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.140> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

packaging it's pretty much a clear one
so<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.659> you'll<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so that is what you'll get and when you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.359 
so that is what you'll get and when you
apply<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.390> um<00:01:52.189> it's<00:01:53.189> kind

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
apply it it is kind of like um it's kind

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
apply it it is kind of like um it's kind
of<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.549> apply<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> gloss<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> wouldn't

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
of like apply like a gloss so I wouldn't

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
of like apply like a gloss so I wouldn't
say<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.009> hundred<00:01:56.189> percent<00:01:56.430> opaque<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.149> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
say is a hundred percent opaque like a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.109 
say is a hundred percent opaque like a
lipstick<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.790> you've<00:01:59.909> got

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

like a darker pigmented lip then the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.819 
like a darker pigmented lip then the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.609 
colors may tire turned out a little bit
darker<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.869> yet<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.049> turns<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.409> something

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

together like this but if you are using
this<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.940> find<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
this I find that you do have to do it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.290 
this I find that you do have to do it
apply<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.950> quite<00:03:14.190> quickly<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.060> quickly

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
apply it quite quickly and do it quickly

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.830 
apply it quite quickly and do it quickly
because<00:03:15.510> once<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.020> dries<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:18.270> kind<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.630> makes

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
because once it dries it kind of makes

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.280 
because once it dries it kind of makes
your<00:03:18.990> lips<00:03:19.290> stick<00:03:19.740> together<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:22.110> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
your lips stick together so you have to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.900 
your lips stick together so you have to
make<00:03:22.410> sure<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:22.830> really<00:03:23.070> fast<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.080 
make sure you do it really fast and
these<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> find<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.740> kind<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.100> dry<00:03:26.550> lips<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
these I find it do kind of dry lips a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.600 
these I find it do kind of dry lips a
lot<00:03:27.270> especially<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.260> don't<00:03:28.470> use<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.370> bomb

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.790 
lot especially if you don't use the bomb
at<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> end<00:03:30.050> so<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.080> need<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.590> sure<00:03:31.620> you

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
at the end so you need to make sure you

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.980 
at the end so you need to make sure you
always<00:03:31.980> apply<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.670> find<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.209> even<00:03:33.390> after

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
always apply it but I find it even after

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.320 
always apply it but I find it even after
like<00:03:34.140> two<00:03:34.380> hours<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.400> still<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.270> of

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
like two hours or so it still kind of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.790 
like two hours or so it still kind of
dries<00:03:36.630> your<00:03:36.870> lips<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.709> keep

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
dries your lips so you have to keep

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.990 
dries your lips so you have to keep
applying<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.430> every<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:39.990> often<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:41.459> also<00:03:41.790> if

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
applying this every so often and also if

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.699 
applying this every so often and also if
you<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:42.270> any<00:03:42.450> if<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.870> chapped<00:03:43.110> lips<00:03:43.440> or

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
you have any if you have chapped lips or

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.010 
you have any if you have chapped lips or
like<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> crack<00:03:44.550> marks<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.270> tends<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
like in a crack marks then it tends to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.990 
like in a crack marks then it tends to
emphasize<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> little<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.400> more<00:03:47.640> as<00:03:47.820> well

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
emphasize that a little bit more as well

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.090 
emphasize that a little bit more as well
the<00:03:48.239> only<00:03:48.390> one<00:03:48.810> thing<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.470> don't<00:03:49.590> like

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
the only one thing that I don't like

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.820 
the only one thing that I don't like
about<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.870> packaging<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.620> how<00:03:52.770> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
about this is the packaging and how the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.370 
about this is the packaging and how the
bottom<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:55.050> one<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.320> you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
bottom is kind of like the one that you

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.930 
bottom is kind of like the one that you
just<00:03:55.500> pull<00:03:55.739> off<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> end<00:03:56.370> kind<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
just pull off at the end kind of like a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.900 
just pull off at the end kind of like a
lip<00:03:57.239> balm<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.750> find<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.770> when<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.430> put<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.820> in

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
lip balm I find it that when I put it in

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.270 
lip balm I find it that when I put it in
my<00:04:00.000> bag<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.420> tends<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.780> fall<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.380> lot<00:04:01.950> quite

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
my bag it tends to fall out a lot quite

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280 
my bag it tends to fall out a lot quite
often<00:04:02.520> even<00:04:02.970> when<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.209> holding<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.720> tends<00:04:04.200> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
often even when I'm holding it tends to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.260 
often even when I'm holding it tends to
drop<00:04:04.590> off<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.700> one<00:04:05.910> thing<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.209> don't

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
drop off and so the one thing I don't

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.180 
drop off and so the one thing I don't
like<00:04:06.510> about<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.110> if<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.260> ask<00:04:07.410> me<00:04:07.560> your<00:04:07.980> ago

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.470 
like about it so if you ask me your ago
I<00:04:08.430> would<00:04:08.550> say<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:08.940> really<00:04:09.270> impressed

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
I would say that I'm really impressed

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.970 
I would say that I'm really impressed
with<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.050> do<00:04:10.110> recommend<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.890> on

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
with is that I do recommend it on

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
with is that I do recommend it on
special<00:04:11.280> occasions<00:04:11.520> because<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.209> does<00:04:12.420> last

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
special occasions because it does last

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.190 
special occasions because it does last
quite<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.440> long<00:04:13.530> time<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.690> as<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.900> see<00:04:16.080> it

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
quite a long time and as you can see it

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.470 
quite a long time and as you can see it
doesn't<00:04:16.560> come<00:04:16.830> off<00:04:17.070> at<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.940> doesn't

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
doesn't come off at all and doesn't

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.870 
doesn't come off at all and doesn't
matter<00:04:18.630> how<00:04:18.810> dark<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.650> gloss<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
matter how dark the gloss is and the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.210 
matter how dark the gloss is and the
color<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.539> won't<00:04:21.720> come<00:04:21.900> off<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.830> guess

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
color is it won't come off but I guess

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.530 
color is it won't come off but I guess
if<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.460> ask<00:04:23.669> me<00:04:23.910> now

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
if you ask me now

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.300 
if you ask me now

that I know there's for example the room

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.970 
that I know there's for example the room
or<00:04:26.460> provoke<00:04:27.000> ellipse<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.500> are<00:04:28.680> better
