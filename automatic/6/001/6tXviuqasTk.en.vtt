all noticed but I always put it down to
my<00:00:46.410> internet<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.399> too<00:00:47.520> quick<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
my internet and I'm just too quick to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.750 
my internet and I'm just too quick to
blame<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.420> I've<00:00:48.829> liked<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:50.190> area<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
blame it because I've liked my area is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
blame it because I've liked my area is
really<00:00:51.239> bad<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.480> Internet<00:00:51.930> connections<00:00:52.289> we

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
really bad for Internet connections we

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
really bad for Internet connections we
can't<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> high<00:00:53.850> speed<00:00:54.149> kind

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
can't get the like the high speed kind

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
can't get the like the high speed kind
of<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.110> always<00:00:55.590> put<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of stuff so I always put it down to that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
of stuff so I always put it down to that
that's<00:00:56.460> probably<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.300> arrogant<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.719> me<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that's probably a bit arrogant of me to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.250 
that's probably a bit arrogant of me to
say<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.930> don't<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
say it that way but I don't know I just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.789 
say it that way but I don't know I just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
never feel comfortable with what I mean

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230

is when I'm hosts I noticed like a such
a<00:01:06.270> massive<00:01:06.780> difference<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.689> can<00:01:09.689> easily

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
a massive difference that I can easily

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
a massive difference that I can easily
blame<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> don't<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> let's<00:01:11.549> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
