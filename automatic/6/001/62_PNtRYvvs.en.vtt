across parts of northern England quite a

cold night in the north in the south I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
cold night in the north in the south I
think<00:01:31.799> most<00:01:32.040> places<00:01:32.250> having<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> dry<00:01:32.970> night<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
think most places having a dry night a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
think most places having a dry night a
lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> cleared<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> more<00:01:34.770> central
