the<00:00:48.690> goal<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.140> tutorial<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> show<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the goal of this tutorial is to show you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.900 
the goal of this tutorial is to show you
how<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> won't<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> reinvent<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> wheel

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
how you won't have to reinvent the wheel

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
how you won't have to reinvent the wheel
instead<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> pendant<00:00:55.350> link<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
instead you just use a pendant link to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.630 
instead you just use a pendant link to
reuse<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.730> already<00:00:56.940> has<00:00:57.210> been<00:00:57.449> created

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
reuse what already has been created

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.979 
reuse what already has been created
we're<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.149> create<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.480> blend<00:01:00.780> file
