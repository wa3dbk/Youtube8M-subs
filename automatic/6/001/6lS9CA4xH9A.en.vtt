 two possibilities where this one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 in real speed 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.780

 Roland is perpetually with the half agreement 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.659
 after we fall 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.659
 at the level of the 7th 15 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.559

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 the device we did what we originally thought 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.719
 at the level of others so we leave as the starting point 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.509

 it starts here 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.119
 because it's important it's at the level of grace 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.919
 of course all the time
