00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.259 
moist I've added the grated parmesan
it's<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.890> very<00:02:40.069> quick<00:02:40.310> moving<00:02:40.700> dish<00:02:40.970> I've

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
it's a very quick moving dish I've

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.910 
it's a very quick moving dish I've
turned<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> hob<00:02:41.810> off<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.380> don't<00:02:42.440> spoil

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
turned the hob off so that I don't spoil

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.490 
turned the hob off so that I don't spoil
it<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:43.970> normally<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.470> on

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
it and but normally I would just get on

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.350 
it and but normally I would just get on
with<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.799> because<00:02:46.069> stopping<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:47.030> do<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> video

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
with it because stopping to do a video

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.180 
with it because stopping to do a video
is<00:02:47.750> quite<00:02:47.989> difficult<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> middle<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.040> this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
is quite difficult in the middle of this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.970 
is quite difficult in the middle of this
recipe<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.970> all<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:50.900> do<00:02:51.019> now<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.500> divide<00:02:51.650> it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
recipe and all we do now is divide it

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.610 
recipe and all we do now is divide it
between<00:02:52.100> four<00:02:52.580> serving<00:02:53.060> bowls<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.690> sprinkle

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
between four serving bowls and sprinkle

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.110 
between four serving bowls and sprinkle
with<00:02:54.709> more<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> grated<00:02:55.489> parmesan<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.000> top

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
with more of the grated parmesan on top

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.650 
with more of the grated parmesan on top
and<00:02:56.600> that's<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.110> de<00:02:57.200> meal<00:02:57.380> done
