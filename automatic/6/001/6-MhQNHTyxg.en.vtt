00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
 servus people but because of traveling from 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.270
 frozen moment photography and today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.270
 dealing with the topic of glass ball 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.340
 You should take care that your photo 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.720
 optical glass increases because it looks 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.730
 glass balls had the problem that you 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.539
 Inclusions in there, yes, I am 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.340
 are processed 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.740
 by foto optical glass you can once 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.260
 shoot free photos where he is still on it 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.840
 Pay attention that the picture in the glass ball 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.600
 is rotated by 180 degrees yes what this 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.620
 effect and it is quite nice 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.780
 you can indeed in post-processing 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.129
 can you turn the photo around that's it 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.339
 picture is right again but that 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.260
 Of course, leave it to yourself where you 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.519
 should also pay attention if you 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 now on a sunny day that does 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.170
 what is not now given us 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.489
 weather caught but now because 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.930
 Sunny weather must pay attention 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.519
 the focal point of this glass ball 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.979
 just outside this sphere 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.320
 that means he must pay attention to where the 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.760
 ball off so you do not put anything 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.960
 in brands hatch or something or your bag 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.060
 holes burns somehow shit 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.950
 or the hands 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.330
 What more to say is you need 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.700
 do not be afraid for you the camera 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.530
 I would break myself with that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.030
 recommend in the blazing sun in too 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.370
 take pictures but you do not need them 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.630
 I'm afraid that the sensor me 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.600
 burned so really works 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.470
 grateful but of course not in the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.410
 photographing the sun 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.510
 small tip with the right one 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.970
 motivsuche yes, you can just go here 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.520
 make a bit of running around 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.110
 here in the ball and then you see yes 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.659
 already looks good like this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.130
 tree here so just the eyes 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.290
 keep it open and times through the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.140
 run landscape and then you see yes 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.250
 what fits what does not fit that I can 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.420
 now also as a small tip sees 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.840
 Although a bit strange if you 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.620
 a bit too smooth 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.110
 what do you do not do everything for a good 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.970
 motive so the photos I would have now 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.979
 the same with the video show with 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.409
 the proven shutter speed and aperture 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.210
 and you might even have a look 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.200
 like the photos and if you like 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.270
 you can also have a look at home 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 is trying with such a glass ball the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.290
 I have one here now 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.120
 Online retailer bought the dealer as well 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.650
 sells books 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.180
 Amazon has a small money and if 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.510
 you like it like it says try it 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.890
 out 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.129
 it definitely makes a lot of fun 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.129
 and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.390
 a little tip from me if you 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.910
 works with the glass ball and this 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.290
 This glasses cloths love comes in 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.810
 any business could do that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.840
 glass ball really streak free clean 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.960
 so get there when we come to the end 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.550
