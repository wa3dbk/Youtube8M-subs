00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.920
 in the quiet water of the pool 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.620
 treetops were reflected 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.480
 reproducing a cocorí underwater jungle 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.150
 He bent down to drink in the hollow of the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.340
 hands and stopped stunned to see in the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.770
 water background a dark face how the 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.410
 little star with hair in small specks 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.570
 tight eyes coccorit porcelain 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.450
 they had in front another pair of eyes that 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.059
 they looked frightened they also blinked 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.100
 blinked he made a morisqueta and the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.670
 little boy of the water answered him with another 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670
 identical 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.739
 where have you been 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.840
 mom is to listen with the ladies not 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.820
 they want nobody else to read me they say that 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.100
 who described it said that I was a monkey 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.950
 so he went to see my wife mom 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.780
 because they do not want anyone else to read to me 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.330
 Mother Dusila does not know what to answer to 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 coconut nor at that time a ship arrives 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.660
 to the port 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.880
 look at this optimal scene 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 the next day the blonde girl and her 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 boat had already left and cocconi was still 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 without understanding why they did not want what 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.530
 keep reading so he decided to go to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 the jungle to find a response gor and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.789
 thought 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
 if they do not read us I do not know how they are going to learn 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.890
 of the history of your country if we 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.759
 we are one of the few books written by 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 Costa Ricans that are read in the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.920
 schools but they say that it offends 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.860
 other negritos who feel bad because 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
 they compare them with me they also say that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 the book generates loss of identity 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 the invisibilization and its valuation of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.619
 the afrodescendant culture 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.569
 but that's how we lived a long time ago 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.909
 we are set in an era 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.159
 different here in the jungle was that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.340
 we fight for our rights 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.140
 we take out the international banana growers 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.079
 our social struggles paid off 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.829
 inside the cocolí there was a 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.840
 battle to leave if the one who left 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.030
 I could solve your question 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.599
 Talamanca had been the last hope 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 what to do and black hole singer who 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.620
 miserable I am but what happens to you color and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.299
 your mom walks like crazy looking for you I do not know 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.690
 why do not they want people to read me 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.170
 ay cocorí your book will always read it 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.660
 maybe not in the schools 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 like you but a book never dies a 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.770
 book is the story of a town that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.590
 nobody can hide no matter how much 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.660
 try it may be people like you 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.849
 those who do not want your book to be read and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 You may also like those who like 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.989
 what they understand are those that look like 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.930
 your girl of the rose but in the end it is 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 each one's decision if the children are 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.580
 feel bad about reading your adventures such 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.709
 Once they understand them and they like them 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.800
 but do not force anyone my 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.720
 bold the books never die so 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.150
 you are not going to die in identity either 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.000
 of Costa Ricans just because in the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.580
 schools do not read you cocorí smiles and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.110
 hugs the black singer to then leave 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.110
 running in search of his mom 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.819
 ah 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.590
 lucila's mom I already understood that there are things 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.420
 good and bad in the story but 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.810
 always someone generates we are not going to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.810
 forget
