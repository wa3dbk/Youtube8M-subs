 another 10 minutes it is very important that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.340
 Be aware of the baked because 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.010
 when you sponge and acquire color you should 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 lower the oven temperature a little and 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.080
 let them cook until they are 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.140
