 it's not just an aircraft instructional ships 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.320
 how are you flying over 35,000 meters 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.809
 of height and have the ability to 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.590
 participate in war actions he 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.900
 has a 900 900 engine is located 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.700
 horsepower that allows us 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.160
 we must have a cruise speed of 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.740
 500 kilometers per hour 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.900
 thanks to the co-production project that 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.480
 1p you run the Korean industry 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.120

 this gradually make the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.059
 transition in this type of aircraft that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.540
 let's say it has an avionics high 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.580
 the most advanced technology in the world and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.170
 also the perfomances that he offers us 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.550
 these aircraft are suitable for 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.160
 the instruction that we need 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.140
 After this successful experience, 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.810
 they carried out negotiations to carry 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.369
 forward the coproduction that not only 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.830
 consists of the assembly of 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.410
 aircraft but in the manufacture of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.350
 parties in the company that has been given 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.800
 account that the level of our technicians

 national companies can participate in 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.870
 the manufacture of parts for 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 civil aeronautics the president of the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 Korean company kai talked about the high
