00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.340
 good afternoon welcome to pretoria 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.840
 today we will see what is the best way to reiterate everything to pass a DVD to 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.859
 our computer and so we can keep the movie 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.859
 and forget about disks and nonsense 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 for this we are going to use an application called jambelÃ­ 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 the website of sant pere next to the cdr 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.579
 we will give don bucks 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.890
 and here 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.909
 It depends if we have a 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:35.219
 the operating system running in 32 or 64 bits will download one or the other this is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.120
 important because if we are in front of them we are using 64 bits will tell us 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.250
 We do not have 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.240
 I do not know what is wrong 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.660
 silly 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.470
 once downloaded 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.800
 we can not open the operation is the most simple thing in the world we have to 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 watch 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 Say what you are looking for 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.480
 ctv 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.590
 we'll go to the dvd card at 10s 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170
 from that point 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.900
 we are not going to look for the different chapters except that we would like 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.260
 simply apply one of the chapters 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.340
 examine him and looking for the chapters et cetera etcetera 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.710
 let's leave them 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 think a little 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 if you are thinking 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.940
 already regarding the chapters 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 sinafina finalist titles throughout 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.030
 here we have to tell you with what big name what we should keep the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.560
 type of format in which we want 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.410
 bad that we have passed 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.980
 the market is well present in the course of mp4 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.900
 I can tell you different options how do you want me to remove it with what quality 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.910
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.460
 the audio tracks that it has 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.940
 you can put one you can put two and then see them in a survey in what 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.820
 will be their titles are have we could also add it been simply 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 put them once open compete in cryptography and the truth is that no 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.239
 much more 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.189
 we would simply start and start applying it as it takes a little 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.409
 depends crowned was between twenty minutes 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.220
 and what they should do 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 do not be a two-hour movie and your computer does not refer to more than 24 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.070
 triumphs abounded you'll take two hours in front of Brazil going faster can 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.089
 take up to 20 minutes 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.089
 to teach you for example is 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.149
 let's see compete 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.060
 I did 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 one of the good things you have to see that had been left with this program 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.309
 is that it keeps the chapters 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.309
 with which we could go to the chapter that we wanted 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.089
 and directly 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.169
 we already have them 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.949
 his little what he discovered recently mickey tries to do 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.449
 So nothing 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.009
 he has reiterated 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.089
 final argued
