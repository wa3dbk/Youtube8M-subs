my guess which as you know those are

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
my guess which as you know those are
proficiency<00:01:29.220> okay<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:29.939> focus<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
proficiency okay well focus is a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.249 
proficiency okay well focus is a
proficiency<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.770> deep<00:01:32.250> impact<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
proficiency and deep impact is in on is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
proficiency and deep impact is in on is
it<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> mw3<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.640> might<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> notes<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.600> cod4

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it in mw3 it might be I notes in cod4
