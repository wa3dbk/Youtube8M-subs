24-7<00:00:13.920> liquid<00:00:14.160> liner<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.509> there's<00:00:15.809> not

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
24-7 liquid liner and I know there's not

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.439 
24-7 liquid liner and I know there's not
really<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> fair<00:00:16.350> fight<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> my

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
really a fair fight but this is my

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.790 
really a fair fight but this is my
favorite<00:00:18.720> liner<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:19.350> actually<00:00:19.650> have

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
favorite liner and I don't actually have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.029 
favorite liner and I don't actually have
any<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.250> other<00:00:20.400> liners<00:00:21.170> with<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.380> brush<00:00:22.710> with

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
any of my other liners with a brush with

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.990 
any of my other liners with a brush with
me<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.060> color<00:00:24.269> path<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:24.990> bad<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
me is the color path is really bad and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
me is the color path is really bad and
you<00:00:27.000> can't<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> thin<00:00:27.720> line<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you can't get a thin line and the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.520 
you can't get a thin line and the
formula<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.480> lumpy<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.550> even<00:00:32.550> look<00:00:33.530> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
formula is like lumpy an even look it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.950 
formula is like lumpy an even look it
just<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.980> sucks<00:00:35.010> i<00:00:35.550> use<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> Urban<00:00:36.930> Decay

compare<00:00:45.480> next<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> supposed<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.219> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
compare next one is supposed to be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
compare next one is supposed to be
liquid<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> weird

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
liquid but it's more like a weird

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
liquid but it's more like a weird
emulsified<00:00:50.399> cream<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.210> bizarre<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
emulsified cream it's bizarre so that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
emulsified cream it's bizarre so that
was<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.980> tiny<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.550> but

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
was one that was a really tiny one but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
was one that was a really tiny one but
see<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.270> color<00:00:57.480> payoff<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
see the color payoff on this I want so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
see the color payoff on this I want so
much<00:00:58.920> better<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.489> smoother<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.840> brush<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
much better and smoother the brush is

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
much better and smoother the brush is
better<00:01:01.500> yeah<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:05.240> it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
better yeah it's not a good look it's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969
