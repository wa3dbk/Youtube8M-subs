00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 which is good in French cinema 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.920
 it's the action that goes without ads have 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:17.330
 no respite beginning of the film 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 close up on a wheat field we look 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.930
 the movie started 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.420
 hardly the film starts the action in this 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.770
 nonstop sense to respites the wind 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.790

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.530
 carefully followed these names you 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.110
 do not understand the rest of the movie 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.000
 and there we see something far away 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.440
 who sinks into the wheat field 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.670

 camera field that's action 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 1 but come to your house because 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.340
 the action still continues its value not 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:20.420
 of respite to the sons the actor who sleeps 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.299
 he sleeps in the movie we watch and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.009
 monitors down the steps up 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.840
 the bathroom opens the door of the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.810
 bathroom between the bathroom 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.289

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.729

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.200
 shower gets dressed opens the door of the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.390
 Bathroom out of the bathroom 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.759
 closed the bathroom door 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.069
 finally in the kitchen take his little 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.209
 lunch before going to join the other 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.220
 in this field through quick to 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.600
 you know 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.270
 but it's important to understand 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.030
 every action of the movie otherwise you're not going 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 not understand the rest of the film and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.400
 the action does not stop this time have 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:22.550
 filmed the actress who is currently 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.570
 monitor a survey descended reads everything 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:36.290
 naked and she walks in her apartment 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:38.630
 we did it q you must know a 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 thing in French cinema the nude 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:48.050
 it's something special it's 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.010
 the unudc interests people but the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.170
 message that has behind the UN access on 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.380
 cus dressed m in pine whaou doubled 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.380
 these people but that's the whole message 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.390
 and to prove to you that I like the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.580
 French cinema 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.930
 I feel bent of several names 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.820
 to the pij big stars and one for example 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.130
 gerard dÃ©pardieu but hey it's easy 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.080
 everyone knows him and we note that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.580
 I like it a lot as we call it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.830
 the nicknamed geepy depardieu gerard and in 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.070
 3rd good he does not play a lot of movies 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.110
 unfair 95% of French films gerard 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.430
 depardieu 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.080
 frankly I love French cinema 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.510
 but if the teachings that I like 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.510
 even more is the American cinema
