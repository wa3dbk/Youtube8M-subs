00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
ethernet so yeah new ventilation system

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.710 
ethernet so yeah new ventilation system
to<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:03.970> think<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.929> flip<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.829> over<00:02:06.720> same

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
to I think so flip it over same

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.820 
to I think so flip it over same
playstation<00:02:08.259> 3<00:02:08.410> logo<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.789> whole<00:02:10.830> simpler

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
playstation 3 logo and whole simpler

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.460 
playstation 3 logo and whole simpler
perspective<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.870> put<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.230> one

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
perspective of that you put this one

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.780 
perspective of that you put this one
over<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> as<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.380> see<00:02:17.700> ventilation<00:02:18.700> on

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
over so as you can see ventilation on

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.830 
over so as you can see ventilation on
the<00:02:18.880> front<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:20.130> one<00:02:21.130> two<00:02:21.489> three<00:02:22.060> four<00:02:22.480> yes

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the front and one two three four yes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.470 
the front and one two three four yes
four<00:02:23.019> USB<00:02:23.709> ports<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:26.790> flip<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.910> over<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.239> more

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
four USB ports so flip it over it's more

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.789

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.200 
not as much for me the other one yeah
just<00:05:17.470> simpler<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.550> can<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:18.820> more<00:05:18.940> room

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
just simpler and you can have more room

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.040 
just simpler and you can have more room
so<00:05:19.900> yeah<00:05:21.060> that's<00:05:22.060> probably<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.570> for<00:05:22.960> this

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
so yeah that's probably it for this

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.159 
so yeah that's probably it for this
