May the company definitely saved money
on<00:01:44.790> bags<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.420> kept<00:01:45.630> thinking<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
on bags I kept thinking that is the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.929 
on bags I kept thinking that is the
faintest<00:01:46.860> print<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.250> ever<00:01:47.399> seen

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
faintest print I've ever seen

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
faintest print I've ever seen
but<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.259> another<00:01:49.979> bag

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
but what it actually is is another bag

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.210 
but what it actually is is another bag
that<00:01:50.939> has<00:01:51.090> been<00:01:51.299> turned<00:01:51.689> inside<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.070> was

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that has been turned inside out that was

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.149 
that has been turned inside out that was
a<00:01:53.430> vegetable<00:01:53.880> fertilizer<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.799> must<00:01:56.070> have

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
a vegetable fertilizer so they must have

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.940 
a vegetable fertilizer so they must have
either<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.119> wording<00:01:57.689> wrong<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.530> or

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
either got the wording wrong on that or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.550 
either got the wording wrong on that or
or<00:01:59.280> something<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.329> had<00:02:00.479> extra<00:02:00.869> bags<00:02:01.020> left<00:02:01.290> over

been 16 dollars which would have made

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.750

a<00:02:49.420> large<00:02:50.260> tube<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:51.040> Christmas<00:02:51.550> wrapping<00:02:51.850> paper

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
a large tube of Christmas wrapping paper

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.090 
a large tube of Christmas wrapping paper
and<00:02:52.480> took<00:02:53.020> all<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.320> wrapping<00:02:53.620> paper<00:02:53.650> off<00:02:54.070> and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
and took all the wrapping paper off and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.570 
and took all the wrapping paper off and
then<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.550> put<00:02:54.760> some<00:02:55.110> plastic<00:02:56.110> wrap<00:02:56.140> on<00:02:56.620> tightly

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
then I put some plastic wrap on tightly

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.520 
then I put some plastic wrap on tightly
on<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.270> end<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.750> held<00:02:58.990> on<00:02:59.140> with<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.320> rubber

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
on one end that I held on with a rubber

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.000 
on one end that I held on with a rubber
band

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
band

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.860 
band
I<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:01.420> poked<00:03:02.200> little<00:03:02.920> holes<00:03:03.250> all<00:03:03.760> over<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
I then poked little holes all over the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.170 
I then poked little holes all over the
end<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.350> tiny<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:05.950> holes<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
end of it tiny little holes that I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.240 
end of it tiny little holes that I
actually<00:03:07.480> made<00:03:08.020> using<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.890> corncob<00:03:09.850> holder<00:03:10.600> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
actually made using a corncob holder and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
actually made using a corncob holder and
I<00:03:12.250> thought<00:03:12.490> this<00:03:12.640> would<00:03:12.820> probably<00:03:13.000> work<00:03:13.360> I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
I thought this would probably work I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.590 
I thought this would probably work I
went<00:03:14.890> outside<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.280> cut<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.790> corner<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.360> the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
went outside and cut the corner of the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.020 
went outside and cut the corner of the
bag<00:03:16.780> open<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.470> poured<00:03:17.890> some<00:03:17.980> into<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.700> tube

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
bag open and poured some into my tube

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.870 
bag open and poured some into my tube
and<00:03:19.360> then<00:03:20.290> begin<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.950> apply<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.760> you're

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880

supposed to apply it every four feet you

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.270 
supposed to apply it every four feet you
just<00:03:25.060> hit<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.300> tube<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.989> ground<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
just hit that tube on the ground and I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.190 
just hit that tube on the ground and I
was<00:03:27.459> hoping<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.120> would<00:03:28.330> work<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.870> my<00:03:29.019> little

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
was hoping it would work that my little

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.830 
was hoping it would work that my little
tube<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.920> cost<00:03:30.190> me<00:03:30.400> nothing<00:03:30.580> would<00:03:31.450> dispense

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
tube that cost me nothing would dispense

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.660 
tube that cost me nothing would dispense
it<00:03:32.050> and<00:03:32.170> sure<00:03:32.380> sure<00:03:32.860> enough<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.220> did<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.489> went

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
it and sure sure enough it did we went

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.759 
it and sure sure enough it did we went
outside<00:03:33.760> almost<00:03:34.209> at<00:03:34.510> nine<00:03:34.630> o'clock<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.260> it's

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
outside almost at nine o'clock so it's

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.350 
outside almost at nine o'clock so it's
almost<00:03:35.980> too<00:03:36.280> dark<00:03:36.519> for<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.940> see<00:03:37.150> but

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
almost too dark for you to see but

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.940 
almost too dark for you to see but
here's<00:03:37.570> how<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.870> looked<00:03:38.080> as<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.320> dispense<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.860> on

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
here's how it looked as I dispense it on

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.070 
here's how it looked as I dispense it on
the<00:03:39.070> ground<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:40.090> can<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.600> little<00:03:40.900> white

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
the ground you can see the little white

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.740 
the ground you can see the little white
circle<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:43.510> worked<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:43.959> great<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.720> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
circle and it worked just great and so I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
circle and it worked just great and so I
just<00:03:47.080> walked<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.680> along<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.160> yard<00:03:48.459> every

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
just walked all along the yard every

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
just walked all along the yard every
four<00:03:49.090> feet<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.330> tapped<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.840> down<00:03:50.019> here<00:03:50.320> it<00:03:50.410> got

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
four feet I tapped it down here it got

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.770 
four feet I tapped it down here it got
even<00:03:50.650> darker<00:03:51.250> but<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.519> flash<00:03:51.790> worked<00:03:52.090> there's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
even darker but the flash worked there's

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.870 
even darker but the flash worked there's
a<00:03:52.900> little<00:03:53.170> milky<00:03:53.500> spore<00:03:53.800> powder<00:03:54.070> circle<00:03:54.730> right

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
a little milky spore powder circle right

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.340 
a little milky spore powder circle right
there

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
there

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.770 
there
I<00:03:56.430> had<00:03:57.430> thought<00:03:57.610> maybe<00:03:57.820> earlier<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.540> would

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
I had thought maybe earlier that I would

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.710 
I had thought maybe earlier that I would
tie<00:03:58.989> up<00:03:59.019> some<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.560> powder<00:03:59.800> in<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.720> pantyhose

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
tie up some of the powder in a pantyhose

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.000 
tie up some of the powder in a pantyhose
and<00:04:02.110> just<00:04:02.260> tie<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> little<00:04:02.620> knot<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
and just tie a little knot in the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.740 
and just tie a little knot in the
pantyhose<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.610> then<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.820> have<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> little

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
pantyhose and then I have a little

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.690 
pantyhose and then I have a little
grabbing<00:04:05.320> tool<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.769> helps<00:04:06.070> me<00:04:06.190> get<00:04:06.370> stuff

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
grabbing tool that helps me get stuff

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.789 
grabbing tool that helps me get stuff
off<00:04:06.910> tall<00:04:07.239> shelves<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.930> thought<00:04:08.110> well<00:04:08.680> I'll

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
off tall shelves and I thought well I'll

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.420 
off tall shelves and I thought well I'll
just<00:04:09.010> walk<00:04:09.220> around<00:04:09.580> holding<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.690> little<00:04:11.080> bag

just walk around holding that little bag

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.620

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
that I made with the pantyhose with the

that I made with the pantyhose with the
spor<00:04:13.840> powder<00:04:14.049> in<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.320> just<00:04:14.470> tap<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.950> down

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
spor powder in and just tap it down

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.000

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
grabber but I absolutely really didn't

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.720 
grabber but I absolutely really didn't
want<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.220> breathing<00:04:21.549> in<00:04:21.880> although<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.620> only

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
I'm pulled to Japanese beetle grubs I've

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.160 
I'm pulled to Japanese beetle grubs I've
read<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.000> over<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.450> over<00:04:28.540> where<00:04:28.840> it's<00:04:28.930> just

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
read that over and over where it's just

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.710 
read that over and over where it's just
not<00:04:29.320> any<00:04:29.590> problem<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.250> two<00:04:30.910> beneficial<00:04:31.570> bugs

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
not any problem to two beneficial bugs

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.100 
not any problem to two beneficial bugs
nor<00:04:32.290> is<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> harmful<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.460> humans<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.630> wanted

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
nor is it harmful to humans but I wanted

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.180 
nor is it harmful to humans but I wanted
to<00:04:35.260> get<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:36.220> eliminate<00:04:37.090> any<00:04:37.360> flyaway<00:04:38.260> powder

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
to get to eliminate any flyaway powder

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.040 
to get to eliminate any flyaway powder
that<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.550> could<00:04:39.880> one<00:04:40.300> because<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.750> was<00:04:40.840> just

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
that I could one because it was just

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.960 
that I could one because it was just
more<00:04:41.230> efficient<00:04:41.740> application<00:04:42.550> doing<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.880> that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
more efficient application doing it that

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.660 
more efficient application doing it that
way<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.680> I'm<00:04:44.800> very<00:04:44.920> pleased<00:04:45.280> with<00:04:45.310> how<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
way so I'm very pleased with how the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.770 
way so I'm very pleased with how the
cardboard<00:04:46.270> tube<00:04:46.630> worked<00:04:47.320> I'm<00:04:47.920> not<00:04:48.190> under<00:04:48.460> any

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
cardboard tube worked I'm not under any

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.000 
cardboard tube worked I'm not under any
delusions<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.930> I'm<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:50.470> going<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.620> have<00:04:50.800> any

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
delusions that I'm not going to have any

delusions that I'm not going to have any
Japanese<00:04:51.550> beetle<00:04:51.970> problems<00:04:52.450> because<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:53.920> just

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
Japanese beetle problems because I just

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.420 
Japanese beetle problems because I just
don't<00:04:54.850> think<00:04:55.150> that's<00:04:55.300> possible<00:04:55.630> however<00:04:56.430> I'm

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
don't think that's possible however I'm

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.520 
don't think that's possible however I'm
hoping<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.090> eliminate<00:04:58.360> many<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.350> Japanese

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530

hoping to eliminate many of the Japanese
Japanese<00:05:00.400> beetles<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.000> might<00:05:01.240> be<00:05:01.360> hatched

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
Japanese beetles that might be hatched

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.520 
Japanese beetles that might be hatched
in<00:05:01.840> our<00:05:02.020> yard

Spore<00:05:12.550> works<00:05:12.790> is<00:05:12.970> that<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.330> Japanese<00:05:13.810> beetle

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
Spore works is that the Japanese beetle

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.560 
Spore works is that the Japanese beetle
ingested<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.760> spores<00:05:16.090> begin<00:05:16.450> to

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
ingested and the spores begin to

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.600 
ingested and the spores begin to
proliferate<00:05:16.780> in<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.290> body<00:05:17.470> until<00:05:18.250> they<00:05:18.400> just

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
proliferate in the body until they just

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.640 
proliferate in the body until they just
take<00:05:18.820> over<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.750> little<00:05:19.960> bugs<00:05:20.170> organs

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
take over and the little bugs organs

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.140 
take over and the little bugs organs
don't<00:05:20.890> work<00:05:21.040> anymore<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.550> dies<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:22.060> then

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
don't work anymore and it dies and then

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.030 
don't work anymore and it dies and then
they<00:05:22.270> just<00:05:22.510> never<00:05:22.660> they<00:05:23.260> never<00:05:23.470> are<00:05:23.680> hatched

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
they just never they never are hatched

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.340 
they just never they never are hatched
in<00:05:24.370> may<00:05:25.150> they<00:05:25.450> never<00:05:25.600> come<00:05:25.900> up<00:05:26.020> out<00:05:26.170> of<00:05:26.290> the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
in may they never come up out of the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.170 
in may they never come up out of the
ground<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:27.220> I'm<00:05:27.430> hoping<00:05:27.700> that's<00:05:27.880> going<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.090> be

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
ground so I'm hoping that's going to be

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.980 
ground so I'm hoping that's going to be
effective<00:05:28.720> I<00:05:29.560> am<00:05:30.250> buying<00:05:31.090> insurance<00:05:31.450> though

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
effective I am buying insurance though

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
traps that have a pheromone lure in them

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.020 
traps that have a pheromone lure in them
to<00:05:37.450> attract<00:05:38.140> any<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.740> should<00:05:39.430> come<00:05:39.640> into<00:05:39.790> my
