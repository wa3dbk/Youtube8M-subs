but<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> quickly<00:01:57.270> realized<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.530> need

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
but I quickly realized that I don't need

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
but I quickly realized that I don't need
half<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> items<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.270> battles<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.930> don't

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
half of the items from battles I don't

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.170 
half of the items from battles I don't
need<00:02:01.259> any<00:02:01.469> weapons<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.640> need<00:02:02.909> any

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
need any weapons and I don't need any

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
need any weapons and I don't need any
melee<00:02:03.840> automata<00:02:04.290> except<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.860> helmets

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
melee automata except for helmets

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.969 
melee automata except for helmets
because<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.000> already<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.020> van<00:02:07.259> ax<00:02:07.469> plate

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
because I already have the van ax plate

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
because I already have the van ax plate
skirt<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.610> tonics<00:02:09.270> play<00:02:09.539> body<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.349> I'm<00:02:10.500> sure

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
skirt and tonics play body so I'm sure

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.589 
skirt and tonics play body so I'm sure
that<00:02:11.009> most<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.520> provide<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> same<00:02:12.180> bonus

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
that most of them provide the same bonus

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.970 
that most of them provide the same bonus
it's<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
it's just the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's just the
effect<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.520> different<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.750> literally<00:02:16.410> don't

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.100 
effect is different so I literally don't
need<00:02:17.010> half<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.520> items<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.239> don't<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:18.989> the

because<00:03:41.730> my<00:03:41.880> stats<00:03:42.180> are<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:42.600> low<00:03:42.840> well

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
because my stats are so low well

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.289 
because my stats are so low well
apparently<00:03:43.650> even<00:03:44.220> with<00:03:44.670> stats<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.120> can

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
apparently even with stats you can

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:45.740 
apparently even with stats you can
kill<00:03:45.569> it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
kill it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.440 
kill it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
am going to do one Sammy trip so we'll

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.309 
am going to do one Sammy trip so we'll
see<00:03:51.600> how<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.900> went

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
see how it went

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.020 
see how it went
hopefully<00:03:52.739> I'm<00:03:52.859> gonna<00:03:53.069> get<00:03:53.489> something<00:03:53.880> good

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
hopefully I'm gonna get something good

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.270 
hopefully I'm gonna get something good
so<00:03:54.450> I'll<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:54.959> right<00:03:55.170> back<00:03:55.350> once<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:55.889> gonna<00:03:56.069> end

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
so I'll be right back once I'm gonna end

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.309 
so I'll be right back once I'm gonna end
the<00:03:56.430> trip<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.910> lot<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.750> said<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.019> it's

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
the trip a lot of you said that it's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.170 
the trip a lot of you said that it's
better<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.920> play<00:03:59.220> against<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.700> me<00:03:59.849> because

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
better not to play against a me because

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.000 
better not to play against a me because
you<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.480> deal<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.930> four<00:04:01.230> thousand<00:04:01.739> or<00:04:01.829> two

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
you can deal that four thousand or two

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.129 
you can deal that four thousand or two
thousand<00:04:02.459> damage<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.120> actually<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.049> think

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
thousand damage to you actually I think

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.050 
thousand damage to you actually I think
it's<00:04:04.319> better<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.680> play<00:04:05.069> because<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.849> see

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
it's better to play because you can see

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.599 
it's better to play because you can see
that<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.420> always<00:04:06.900> receive<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.950> magic

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
that I always receive that one magic

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.020 
that I always receive that one magic
damage<00:04:08.870> from<00:04:09.870> something<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.349> see<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.650> one

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
damage from something you see that one

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.059 
damage from something you see that one
that's<00:04:12.030> actually<00:04:12.389> from<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.750> minion<00:04:13.139> if

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
that's actually from the minion if

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.949 
that's actually from the minion if
you're<00:04:14.310> playing<00:04:14.669> magic<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.359> always<00:04:15.750> going<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
you're playing magic is always going to

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.009 
you're playing magic is always going to
deal<00:04:16.169> one<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.190> during<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.760> fight<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.780> know<00:04:18.900> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
deal one so during the fight you know it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.240 
deal one so during the fight you know it
takes<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.560> even<00:04:19.829> know<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.160> this

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
takes like I don't even know in this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.820 
takes like I don't even know in this
account<00:04:20.579> how<00:04:20.700> long<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.239> takes<00:04:21.419> but<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:22.440> magic

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
account how long it takes but the magic

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.420 
account how long it takes but the magic
prayer<00:04:23.039> absorbs<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.789> lot<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.419> damage<00:04:25.280> plus<00:04:26.280> you

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
prayer absorbs a lot of damage plus you

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.920 
prayer absorbs a lot of damage plus you
absorb<00:04:26.789> some<00:04:27.000> magic<00:04:27.300> damage<00:04:27.479> for

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
absorb some magic damage for

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.010 
absorb some magic damage for
the<00:04:28.020> boss<00:04:28.199> itself<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:28.949> that<00:04:29.759> means<00:04:29.970> voltage<00:04:30.720> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
the boss itself so that means voltage is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.870 
the boss itself so that means voltage is
going<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.259> absorb<00:04:31.500> way<00:04:31.830> more<00:04:32.070> than<00:04:32.220> 4-thousand

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
going to absorb way more than 4-thousand

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.450 
going to absorb way more than 4-thousand
health<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.600> even<00:04:33.900> if<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.080> get<00:04:34.229> hit<00:04:34.470> 4000<00:04:35.250> it's

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
health so even if you get hit 4000 it's

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.490 
health so even if you get hit 4000 it's
actually<00:04:36.060> better<00:04:36.330> than<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:36.990> playing<00:04:37.320> at<00:04:37.470> all

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
actually better than not playing at all

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.520 
actually better than not playing at all
I<00:04:38.150> wonder<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.419> will<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:39.690> able<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.139> kill<00:04:40.350> this

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
I wonder if I will be able to kill this

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.040 
I wonder if I will be able to kill this
one<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.070> going<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.310> be<00:04:41.400> quite<00:04:41.639> close<00:04:41.970> all<00:04:42.570> some

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
one is going to be quite close all some

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.200 
one is going to be quite close all some
poison<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.740> probably<00:04:44.310> even<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.759> teleport

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
poison so probably even if I teleport

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.040 
poison so probably even if I teleport
out<00:04:45.389> I'm<00:04:45.630> gonna<00:04:45.810> die<00:04:46.789> in<00:04:47.789> before<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.330> teleport

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
out I'm gonna die in before I teleport

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.870 
out I'm gonna die in before I teleport
and<00:04:49.320> then<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.800> good<00:04:50.009> item<00:04:50.220> drops<00:04:50.639> on<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:50.850> ground

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
and then a good item drops on the ground

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.330 
and then a good item drops on the ground
I<00:04:51.449> have<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.960> teleport<00:04:52.229> now<00:04:53.990> good<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.340> if
