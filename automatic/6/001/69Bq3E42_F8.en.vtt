a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.709> bit<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.489> might<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.790> been<00:03:32.880> able<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
a little bit you might have been able to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.060 
a little bit you might have been able to
hear<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.450> click<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.900> dips<00:03:34.170> down<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.950> other

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.319 
locator pins in its channel down it's
that<00:03:38.760> easy

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
that easy

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.180

would at the brow area of the helmet up
towards<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.380> top<00:06:04.410> just<00:06:05.400> kind<00:06:05.580> of<00:06:05.670> grab<00:06:05.910> it

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
towards the top just kind of grab it

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.040 
towards the top just kind of grab it
give<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.600> just<00:06:06.720> a<00:06:06.990> light<00:06:07.500> light<00:06:08.400> little<00:06:08.610> tug

give it just a light light little tug
comes<00:06:10.050> right<00:06:10.380> out<00:06:10.640> there's<00:06:11.640> your<00:06:11.850> top<00:06:12.030> pad<00:06:14.000> if

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
comes right out there's your top pad if

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.150 
comes right out there's your top pad if
we<00:06:15.090> can<00:06:15.210> get<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> look<00:06:15.510> at<00:06:15.570> the<00:06:15.690> EPS<00:06:16.110> there<00:06:16.380> and

we can get a look at the EPS there and

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.590 
we can get a look at the EPS there and
see<00:06:17.340> there's<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.610> couple<00:06:17.820> of<00:06:17.970> channels<00:06:18.420> that

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
see there's a couple of channels that

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.660 
see there's a couple of channels that

are very similar in my opinion they're a

little bit better than the snow that's

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.320 
little bit better than the snow that's
really<00:06:53.099> debatable<00:06:53.580> so<00:06:53.729> I'm<00:06:53.819> not<00:06:53.969> going<00:06:54.149> to<00:06:54.209> get

really debatable so I'm not going to get

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.549 
really debatable so I'm not going to get
