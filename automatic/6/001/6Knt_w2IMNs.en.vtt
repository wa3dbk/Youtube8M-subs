00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello there is my place again 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.879
 Mouth release I will build a bench in 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.030
 minecraft poket edishn version but 75 and we 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:16.129
 can build from one bucket of lava from 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 from the boards of the torch and everything in general 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.770
 look 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:28.130
 we put the boards like this 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:32.570
 parallel to each other is such a length 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.809
 there will be enough home let's here 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:43.460
 often do you where he is already on the island at this 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:46.999
 it will be bad pouring I will arrange from the boards 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.199
 because boards are easy to burn and more 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:53.199
 chance that that no matter how they are caught 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:02.390
 meets let's calculate from the beginning 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.120
 3 and 4 block two two three four here 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.920
 here we will put 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:18.910
 our very trap see how her 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:26.710
 do we put so here now we take the torch 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:31.190
 the undead now see the most important thing 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.930
 torch we put gravel on not yet 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:40.750
 completed our trap let's not 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:46.370
 Still yet another of perhaps starlings 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.110
 See here put to 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.110
 it turned out such a cup 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 such a trap, but this is not the end 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:09.960
 now one more row with better 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 do so that she was a person 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.090
 because so more likely that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 lest they see gravel those who will 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.950
 fall for this trap now 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 closed up 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.150
 I'll show you now, in principle, ours 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.100
 Trap's ready to see the man that I am well, 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.800
 for example it will be test 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.190
 any there need to go to the end here 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.950
 there is a man noticing anything that that 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.830
 here it is getting dark and he does not like 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.550
 you go in the dark suddenly there is a zombie 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.310
 turns out he takes just doing just 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.440
 that's what that says is revenge torch there 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.580
 it is very obvious therefore the most this unit 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.450
 and so here we put it so he breaks 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.890
 our torch 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.510
 here falls gravel well, maybe there is a schedule 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.120
 it is also not magic 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.640
 but here's how blood so closed the passage for us 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.820
 sometimes it break little may in blood 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.210
 dropped in general such a trap plus now 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.709
 it can catch fire all and no one 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.350
 develop how its built in the sense in 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.090
 In general, here is such a trap with you 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.560
