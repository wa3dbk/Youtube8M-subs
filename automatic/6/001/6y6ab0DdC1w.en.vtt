 miranda and really very pleased with 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.210
 see to fill a segment of the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.360
 market is somehow a bit 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 unassisted not this one can say that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.150
 the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 the model 600 is a maker that has 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 versatile university very good because it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 can say that a model that we 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 allows to be in town and if suddenly 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 you want to take a longer walk 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 make a little more serious something more than 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 adventure equally the bike goes to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.399
 answer very well is a model that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.710
 It has an Italian design ok and a powerful 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.619
 real engine that answers us very very 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.180
 well and a spectacular braking really 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.190
 we are very happy with this launching 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 the four motorcycle have proposed a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.729
 little bit more just the engine the motorcycle if the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.860
 motorcycle in four cylinders of 600 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.259
 cubic centimeters as it has a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.850
 moment is a model makers what 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 it means that the person is very 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 comfortable on the motorcycle 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 why the versatility that can 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 work in both city and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 road as a basis for what 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.179
 expectations do you have with this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.429
 good motorcycle if it's true like you 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.780
 you said they are waiting to answer 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.880
 to a market need that is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.250
 unassisted you feel that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.170
 indeed the motorcycle in Venezuela 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.310
 as well as not really us by the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.540
 experience that we have a good 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.480
 talkative aspirant in venezuela in 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.400
 motorcycle 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.380
 allows you to have an experience with 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.170
 years that has allowed us some way 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.490
 have that customer loyalty and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.550
 really because we have 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.800
 positioned leaders in what are the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.390
 low market segment mechanisms 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 with this bike to fill that expectation 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.220
 because already those people who want a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.960
 not small motorcycle not very pleasant displacement 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.280
 as is our product in it and that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.930
 also good is our product 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
 really looking for a segment 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.710
 intermediate with an excellent relationship 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 Price-value that is very important 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.960
 say it on a motorcycle that will be in the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.270
 order of 240 thousand 145 thousand bolivars in its 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.040
 launch stage and we hope to have 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.400
 for this first year of let's say 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
 500 operations a thousand units to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.130
 the best sounds a little bit because really 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.080
 we have a great expectation in the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.030
 market with the bike but gradually it 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.530
 We hope to increase the amount 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.000
 of units for this segment to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.570
 able to satisfy the demand of the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.730
 market the users in particular the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.170
 motorcycle segment that has grown 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.660
 enormously in venezuela in the past 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.300
 years by many variables that we like 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.660
 touch sometimes have 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.180
 the appreciation that there is difficulty in 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.980
 spare not of your brand but of the motorcycle 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 in general we know and understand that the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.760
 paper has always been very respectful of 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.950
 that tell us a bit how is the part 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.480
 of response if I explain what happens 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.640
 we do not really have a 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.050
 very important responsibility with 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.630
 our final customers as to what 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.220
 what is warranty service and spare parts what 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.200
 What has happened to us is also that many 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.820
 times the market somehow there 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.710
 spare parts that apply for various brands 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.420
 then we prepare our 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 We prepare the stock of our 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.710
 spare parts for a market that we have 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.600
 but there are really other brands that 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.190
 they also feed on the empire for 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.840
 cover your answer part things that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.280
 does that sometimes suddenly to the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.830
 better there may be some deficiency 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.600
 but we are working day to 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.040
 day to improve everything that our 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.590
 labor as a sale is from our main 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.940
 commitment because we have customers that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.190
 by experience and by 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.900
 investigations that we have done in him in 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.940
 what is the empire's time have 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.880
 changed we are 25 and 6 times and always 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.840
 prefer we have to somehow 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.060
 reward their clients that there was 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.120
 chosen as 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.250
 to this date what is the model of empire 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.139
 which has sold more than better 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.549
 response has had the client 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.950
 he feels he is waiting for the launch 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.200
 of the new model of that same motorcycle 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.389
 look, we have a range of 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.250
 pretty broad options as to what 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.840
 which is all the segmentation what 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.030
 we have products that if really 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.160
 we have a significant percentage of 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.840
 participation that are the products of 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
 low displacement we are talking about the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.740
 better than the owen that more than all are 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.350
 motorcycles for work and in this segment 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.419
 they are absolutely free then of 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.040
 somehow those customers buy their 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.560
 bikes for work but maybe 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.060
 They look for love on a hard shoulder or look for a 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.040
 spirit for the weekends 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.900
 then we really have how to be able 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.850
 satisfy all that demand for 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.430
 our clients in peace can solve 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.710
 all expectations because we have a 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.180
 fan of incredible options and about 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.680
 all good with this model that we say 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.630
 in the lid of the jar because of some 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.669
 way already with this model we could 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.710
 cover all the market cement that 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.479
 we have seen with pleasure that in paying 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.370
 also regardless of your campaign 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.020
 of direct marketing of their 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.969
 products has a campaign 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.619
 social responsibility 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.809
 interesting especially at the moment in 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:24.610
 the one that in Venezuela good there is security 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.979
 there are many figures that maybe the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.499
 People get scared or want to stigmatize 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.629
 motorized behind these that 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:35.229
 new projects have days of us 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.339
 this we have concentrated on the country not 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.409
 it's simply an assembler of 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:41.409
 motorcycles we have worried a lot 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.299
 to know the motorized with more style 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.069
 of life and we really stay 

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:47.799
 impressed what's under that 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.089
 carbon and that is precisely why we have 

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:51.009
 locked an awareness campaign 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.319
 because we know that what we have a 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.110
 education issue we have to look for the 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.759
 way that our motorized not and 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.439
 also let the wheel in 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.929
 vehicles and pedestrians because a lot 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.339
 more responsibility that goes to all not 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.139
 only the motorized ones only 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.849
 always somehow we try to say 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.339
 that motorized but it really exists 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.449
 a commitment on the part of the company 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:14.739
 everything is an education campaign 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.419
 awareness road of what you should 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.039
 be a motorized in a good way in 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.869
 part is a great effort in that 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.610
 meaning and obviously we are looking 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:23.409
 alliances with the inst with other 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.790
 institutions because we know that everything is 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.650
 a joint effort 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.720
 who are we where can you 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.850
