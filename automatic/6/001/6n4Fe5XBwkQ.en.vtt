00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.779
 I welcome it to another video of a motion around today 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.560
 By way of exception, no ghost or miscellaneous whereby one can not say it is one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.470
 small mountain 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.339
 but I just call it Earth and Preview 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.280
 then yes 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.670
 I get through today's add-on archeology to introduce something 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.439
 Similarly, this looks like the head is shooting compares course 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.330
 again a new call center finding that quite normal 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.610
 to do the ob 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.630
 because nothing changes because of that, but actually represents quite 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.610
 First let's go into it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.560
 the add-on once on and while new FC 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.330
 so that goals of the whole canton is, of course, came the ice layer Jugi 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.820
 Of course, I simply simplify simplifying that, of course 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 in the sense that one does not look at the year so long, Teismann said darkly 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.160
 Polin has to 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.180
 but that one directly shows the direct support percentages around 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.910
 Forrest could be 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.580
 Here you can see the green cap on top of two sets for OHD money 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.900
 Green lamp 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.510
 We will set it one more soon 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 a podium of course 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.369
 and I want to show "We just look at it in practice 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.310
 as soon as one opens the minime we see the same picture here 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.260
 you see 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.440
 yes there has been a lot to do, for example, the directly are already 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.060
 Spots marked that is the attachment Auen to KAP am 11 2 um respectively 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.730
 the Gerber with Data 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.770
 then I find quite interesting if you do not want to have it you have to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.240
 Of course you do not download 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 then the whole spot would have to collect itself 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.119
 and yes that was somehow too much work for me, if only so 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.280
 Information Attig are present 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.820
 you like to access information like that 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.570
 otherwise, let's just put it into practice and fly 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.230
 now about it to the south when post 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.730
 I just start to look at it 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.500
 the e6 now already in the winter come so singles in the picture 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.780
 and from these layers, these little yellow circles in the army circle 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.720
 stands for a possible since in this case it is loud battlefield 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.089
 Fish fragments 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.079
 censhare digging normally looks at the current red lamp chicken now just 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.859
 on the Rother old wounds in the ARD in these at this new era 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.339
 and then you see, we got a red top now 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.769
 and then the package is now almost the way we get there the best 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.529
 here again an overlap that one would have now just one time 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.169
 Step back 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.599
 and Bern can then make up for that maybe better 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.039
 visible as her son sees Fiedler at the points because of it 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.890
 Exactly now it will be just Dr 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.080
 One of the three who are now here in this green field to find "I 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.240
 have now just done with ECG and then a foul exactly the goals so 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.649
 just became 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:58.009
 and then it would have to be a fragment on the top left of the wall 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.909
 there are still legal questions about this 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.729
 Spot in the course so as the product archeology Fund was three times 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.419
 so it can dig around three times 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.779
 worked again with the red overlay because Latif would be far away 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.089
 I'm still flying a bit further now 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.089
 but has me here briefly curtailed in the house and 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.980
 I suppose you should have the wrath of yours and maybe he'll succeed right there 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:26.999
 one is 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.259
 that looks so nice because of the sledding 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.529
 and you do not have that right so it can only be this spot up here 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.979
 which 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.369
 Area of ​​the topic field is located 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.619
 and the Stückemarkt hit the pipe to the point just as I say more 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:46.459
 then there is just the same horn around all professionals who work quickly 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.019
 want to come up 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.879
 or so you want to have an aging one by that's fine 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:52.979
 Interesting 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.569
 then his phoenix would have to go over it again to Tamara locality I show 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.799
 you again 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.669
 an example at another spot 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.820
 and yes also arrived and Hamas 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.799
 Dante's big spot has already grazed 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.799
 Unfortunately that was not so nice to feel there is a relatively long time 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.709
 Has lasted 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.499
 so decided the little one 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.159
 the smallest place where you can get trollt harbor 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.870
 the others in the survey they of course which fragments or 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.269
 Fossils or tablets are there 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.530
 Bundesbern that is really interesting or just a good one 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.860
 Overview 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.039
 digging around Dr Dr as the ad and did not follow and now it can 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.110
 only one of the 3 um 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.409
 m argument possible Stone Company right in the picture 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.409
 that's why we've just been here now 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.979
 he will not change much it has limited to two 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.240
 the now just to the middle 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 and that's exactly what the low point must be here 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.460
 exactly to the point and dig again and then that should 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.759
 to come to the troika for her 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.229
 tangible to me but that time again dig exactly and then yes to the point 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.060
 met exactly 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.050
 how much the one and wondered 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.069
 just with the percent 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.539
 with the data loss of the 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.849
 at the bar Mack 2 so op if you do not want to have that you can 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.360
 of course also disable 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.449
 and work only with the professionals themselves but I think that's pretty handy 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.029
 and always like to take that with us 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.549
 Jada archeology itself is a giant time waster 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.990
 Publisher shortens us that time here just once 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.480
 let some and you see that works wonderfully 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.670
 Again, on the basis of the current example here but for a last 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.870
 example 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.280
 As always, of course, step one dig then pay attention to the lamp and 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.469
 Press Nick button 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.770
 and become one of the three points 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.779
 panicky the expert appreciates for the middle one we want 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.900
 and then again, and then there again he wanted law areas 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.729
 the troika are fixed 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.249
 and yes that was my little hotel around my little l and preview to the 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.249
 Men archeology Halper or Gerber with 2 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.020
 in order to need two so as I said only for the points 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.349
 or for those here with Dickens word around it find it 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.499
 personally relatively interesting 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.639
 and especially useful with the 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.879
 with the one with the ladies 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.129
 On data here again the optimists said here Gerda Mercks 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.179
 Of course, also make out how can change various settings but 

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:29.339
 I left everything relatively normal 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:30.620
 and yes 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.110
 all information all Do Not links can be found below in the cradle 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.650
 Description linked 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.460
 or if you're right on a motion pages is something high kids for 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.759
 the 3 add-ons to download 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.289
 or a little far to a simple shift the helpers 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.590
 and percent Galler Mezzo and Gerda Metzroth Data for all that 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.360
 despite or archaeological finds around us one can also be 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.849
 Activation as I said you can see again 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.419
 a stay and wine or make out 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.229
 and Palm yes I hope I could help you with the Paldauern aap something 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.189
 respectively 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.529
 introduce an interesting program and thank you to the camp up 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.999
 soon that will do well Schaub
