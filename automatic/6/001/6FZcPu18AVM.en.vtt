00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.480
 player trainers no one else 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.480
 and if players do not 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.539
 they do not wind you're in difficulty and 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.279
 if you can not create 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.310
 empathy with the players too 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.380
 comment where you are in difficulty 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.000
 I was with the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 five players of mine 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 2nd Madrid and three of the inter 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.320
 and it was good 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.829
 It was good because I was with 5 what 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.390
 who have contributed and that's why I felt 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.760
 a little excited because for me the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 players are the most important thing about me 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.500
 career I embraced the 5 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.320
 with the same meaning that I had 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 embrace everyone because without them I do nothing 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.200
 If the player is nothing without people 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.570
 work with me nothing and without love of 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.270
 family and motivation and kicker and give 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.900
 to continue nothing I'm not when 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 never love that I have for my players 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 and now with this is to death and one day 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.540
 I want I want to win things with this is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.320
 which is the clearest thing most important 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.980
 we've been six months, I think it's a 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.000
 person 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.220
 they do not have to see mourinho 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.830
 in which people are a person who 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.000
 he worries about all his players never 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.230
 forget the people who are around 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.200
 the players who are also the most 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.960
 important that I think that load in the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.700
 background of the wardrobe I think very 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.190
 colleagues, we are delighted that you are 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.470
 with us and what we hope we want 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.240
 that this time proved because I believe 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.060
 that Real Madrid has found the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.820
 coach who has to have the time 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.340
 those that made us more professionals west 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 won more of the lives of more people than 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 we are better than us and so 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.640
 happens with coaches as the most 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.620
 played 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.979
 for that also 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.700
 and I already knew what to win because I know 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.010
 you won the unfair I do not hide the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.560
 another I think because he has won three 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.720
 important titles could very well be another 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.310
 that's why I am very happy very professional 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.490
 both Mr. Mourinho and the team 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.930
 Our technique learned a lot because 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.930
 I like to work with people 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.340
 professional and that gives me a lot of motivation 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 and I'm because I had a dream of 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.420
 working with they 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.530
 for being the best but it was also imported 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.140
 which is the story that has the titles 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.640
 and you already have a company that dream that 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.790
 concretized 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.190
 what you want most of us to win 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.770
 that has won with inter with port with 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.319
 a chelsea that we can win here in 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.030
 madrid because they are winning the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.610
 players we also win that's why we're going 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.209
 work together to win hopefully hopefully 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.760
 so be it good for all 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.490
 Real Madrid hopefully for next year 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 there are also many more real nominees 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.760
 Madrid 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.459
 the reflection of a season that speech 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:27.030
 full of successes and that has covered covers 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.030
 comments and all kinds of awards 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 next 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.879
 second for me I prefer a player 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.450
 I preferred that he was a player 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:43.269
 player was going to win me because not next 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.050
 year will we be to have 23 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.230
 nominated players 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.490
 with one has won and it seems to me that this 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.650
 for what he is doing 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.050
 she enough to like to 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.420
 win and one day a goalkeeper has to 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.120
 win and a dike and a goalie win 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.590
 it has to be this because maybe one 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.470
 of these two 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.120
 this one has to win in his career he has 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.519
 than winning four or five gold balls 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.260
 and this one has to win one that is very 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.180
 difficult for a goalkeeper to win but 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.400
 you also have to win a player from 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.620
 field has the same value that has the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.750
 why else why not 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.370
 I continue with the opinion 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.920
 because you want to have should be in 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.730
 the three because not in winning because he won 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.610
 the world cup has done 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.340
 very good ordinary things for the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.790
 world with young then the change 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.090
 penalty 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.980
 because not me sometimes I do not understand 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.790
 as the concept from the fifa 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.980
 but I was very glad to be a 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.460
 goalkeeper because he deserves it too 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.980
 these players like us for the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.280
 quality that has gray 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.170
 I believe that the jump imposes on itself the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.230
 to be there that is a born winner and he 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.630
 wants to be among the three nominees at 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.400
 next golden ball not us 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.410
 everything possible to help you so that 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.480
 also the team will clothe you so much 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.530
 also with him with the coach and he goes 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.240
 do everything possible for the team 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.490
 as well 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.849
 help him to have no doubt 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.729
 that we want the Christian to be 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.979
 the best is the top scorer because 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.180
 also to madrid we are interested in having 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.289
 best player in the world in our 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.630
 our template is not by chance that 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.880
 while he died won 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.550
 56 years 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.890
 so many titles now mister mourinho de 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.800
 little time that I have been with it 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:46.090
 for me a lesson I am learning 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.120
 I feel moralized more than ever 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.220
 and I want to continue like this because I know what 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.260
 that part of many is from them 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.090
 I have also seen the tan of his team 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.030
 because I feel very comfortable being 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.430
 to work with them I think this is 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.650
 the work that I have had each one has 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.570
 contributed something each one has given me a 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.389
 teaching and of all I learned a lot 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.889
 to be captain of the Real Madrid of the 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.560
 selection because we do not agree on a 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.210
 moment at least to my positive part 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.490
 And maybe I have a touch of maturity that 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.620
 before I did not have then I think he is 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.889
 the right person to whom you can 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.900
 keep here helping me to follow 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.229
 trying to take the whole group to a 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.229
 collective good 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:31.460
 I've had the emotions that I've had already 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.960
 even though tomorrow school day 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.389
 sure he came home that my children did not 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.430
 they are not asleep or if they are 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.939
 asleep so asleep over there and I 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.809
 they wait with my wife other emotions and 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.809
 tomorrow other days
