the power button again easy to reach and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.609 
the power button again easy to reach and
on<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.320> nice<00:01:28.320> cut

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
on to the back we get it really nice cut

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
on to the back we get it really nice cut
out<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.220> camera<00:01:29.790> microphone<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> flash

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
out for our camera microphone and flash

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
out for our camera microphone and flash
you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.579> tiny<00:01:33.060> but

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you can see it's really tiny but

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
you can see it's really tiny but
everything's<00:01:34.229> perfect<00:01:34.770> no<00:01:35.100> problems<00:01:35.460> with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
everything's perfect no problems with

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.719 
everything's perfect no problems with
that<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> case<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that and this because this case is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.880 
that and this because this case is
actually<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.270> thin<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:40.140> don't<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.650> Liam

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
actually so thin we don't get a Liam

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
actually so thin we don't get a Liam
table<00:01:41.250> design<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:41.729> brace<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> bezel<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
table design or i brace the bezel so you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
table design or i brace the bezel so you
do<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.610> worry<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.479> myself

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
do have to worry about that I do myself

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.190 
do have to worry about that I do myself
have<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> classroom<00:01:46.979> tacked<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
have a classroom tacked it on so it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.230 
have a classroom tacked it on so it
doesn't<00:01:49.259> protect<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.950> screen<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> onto<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
doesn't protect my screen and onto the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 
doesn't protect my screen and onto the
back<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.430> case<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> thin<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
back because this case is so thin that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
back because this case is so thin that
the<00:01:55.640> camera<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.909> actually<00:01:58.729> thicker<00:01:59.729> than<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the camera is actually thicker than the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.959 
the camera is actually thicker than the
case<00:02:00.329> itself<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.500> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.770> compare<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
case itself so if you want to compare if

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
case itself so if you want to compare if
you<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> comparison<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.560> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you want to comparison you should really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.300 
you want to comparison you should really
check<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.240> camera<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.659> actually

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
check that out the camera is actually

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.850 
check that out the camera is actually
protruding<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.459> lot<00:02:08.789> compared<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> case<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
protruding a lot compared to the case so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.760 
protruding a lot compared to the case so
this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> very<00:02:11.459> nice<00:02:11.670> case<00:02:12.090> all<00:02:13.020> around
