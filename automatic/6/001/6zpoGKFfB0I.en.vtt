um<00:04:12.599> comparing<00:04:13.599> this<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:14.880> rooting<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:16.709> android

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
um comparing this to rooting a android

right here and i guess if we go over to

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.870 
right here and i guess if we go over to
our<00:04:50.229> phone<00:04:50.590> now<00:04:50.830> all<00:04:51.070> my<00:04:51.250> phone<00:04:51.460> your<00:04:51.850> phone

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
matter so I will click on and get let me

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.149 
matter so I will click on and get let me
slide<00:06:23.169> that<00:06:23.319> out<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:23.590> way<00:06:23.680> let<00:06:23.830> me<00:06:23.889> see<00:06:24.039> if

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
slide that out the way let me see if

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.540 
slide that out the way let me see if
city<00:06:24.430> is<00:06:24.520> actually<00:06:24.849> going<00:06:24.970> to<00:06:25.060> load<00:06:25.210> up<00:06:26.550> click
