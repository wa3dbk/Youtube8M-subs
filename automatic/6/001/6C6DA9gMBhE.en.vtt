societal<00:02:23.630> cost<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:25.130> do<00:02:25.490> think<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.090> sugar

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
societal cost and we do think it's sugar

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.220 
societal cost and we do think it's sugar
but<00:02:27.020> what<00:02:27.890> exactly<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.610> sugar<00:02:28.880> cause<00:02:29.240> so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
but what exactly the sugar cause so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.380 
but what exactly the sugar cause so
obviously<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.730> your<00:02:31.760> tooth

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
obviously you know you have your tooth

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690 
obviously you know you have your tooth
decay<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.840> dental<00:02:33.500> issues<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
decay and dental issues but then it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.390 
decay and dental issues but then it
leads<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.180> far<00:02:35.510> more<00:02:35.540> serious<00:02:36.440> problems<00:02:37.160> like

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
leads to far more serious problems like

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.880 
leads to far more serious problems like
diabetes<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.450> heart<00:02:38.630> disease<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.260> some

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
diabetes and heart disease and some

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.310 
diabetes and heart disease and some
people<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:40.940> suggesting<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:42.140> there

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
people are now suggesting that there

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.980 
people are now suggesting that there
might<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.830> new<00:02:43.220> type<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.610> disease<00:02:44.210> diabetes

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
might be a new type of disease diabetes

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.080 
might be a new type of disease diabetes
in<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.740> brain<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.430> they're<00:02:46.670> calling

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
in the brain that they're calling

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.960 
in the brain that they're calling
diabetes<00:02:47.780> type<00:02:48.110> 3<00:02:48.710> which<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.400> related<00:02:49.580> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
diabetes type 3 which is related to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.570 
diabetes type 3 which is related to
Alzheimer's<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:50.870> there<00:02:51.830> could<00:02:52.070> be<00:02:52.100> some

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
Alzheimer's and there could be some

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.780 
Alzheimer's and there could be some
cancers<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.390> are<00:02:53.660> linked<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.830> high<00:02:55.280> intake

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
cancers that are linked to a high intake

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.990 
cancers that are linked to a high intake
of<00:02:55.940> sugar<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.560> let's<00:02:57.980> examine<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.700> got

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
of sugar so let's examine how we got

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.690 
of sugar so let's examine how we got
here<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.540> in<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.140> processed<00:03:00.680> foods<00:03:00.980> isn't

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
here it's in the processed foods isn't

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300 
here it's in the processed foods isn't
it<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.660> sugary<00:03:03.230> drinks<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> ice

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
it it's the sugary drinks and the ice

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.660 
it it's the sugary drinks and the ice
creams<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.240> chocolate<00:03:05.540> bars<00:03:06.020> right<00:03:06.670> well

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
creams and a chocolate bars right well

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.640 
creams and a chocolate bars right well
the<00:03:07.970> problems<00:03:08.360> started<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.780> few<00:03:09.050> decades<00:03:09.440> ago

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the problems started a few decades ago

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.400 
the problems started a few decades ago
when<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.460> focus<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.360> industry<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:12.170> on

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
when the focus in the industry was on

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.220 
when the focus in the industry was on
low<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:13.010> low<00:03:13.370> fat<00:03:13.700> diet<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.630> whole<00:03:14.900> food

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
low a low fat diet the whole food

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.200 
low a low fat diet the whole food
industry<00:03:15.740> immediately<00:03:16.400> jumped<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.000> diet

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
industry immediately jumped on the diet

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.750 
industry immediately jumped on the diet
and<00:03:17.510> wanted<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.960> be<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.260> first<00:03:18.290> ones<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.250> put

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
and wanted to be the first ones to put

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.420 
and wanted to be the first ones to put
big<00:03:20.300> size<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.110> their<00:03:21.290> foods<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.920> they<00:03:22.130> had

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
big size on their foods that they had

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.160 
big size on their foods that they had
thought<00:03:22.700> they<00:03:22.970> were<00:03:23.030> they<00:03:23.480> have<00:03:23.660> low<00:03:23.870> fat

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
thought they were they have low fat

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.520 
thought they were they have low fat
thoughts<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.660> though<00:03:26.660> they<00:03:26.870> did<00:03:27.080> make<00:03:27.290> them

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
thoughts but though they did make them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.190 
thoughts but though they did make them
low<00:03:27.710> fat<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:28.460> were<00:03:28.520> filled<00:03:29.030> up<00:03:29.240> with<00:03:29.480> you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
low fat they were filled up with you

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.710 
low fat they were filled up with you
guys<00:03:30.380> did<00:03:30.590> sugar<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.400> now<00:03:32.210> we're<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
guys did sugar and now we're in the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 
guys did sugar and now we're in the
middle<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:33.080> an<00:03:33.230> obesity<00:03:33.770> epidemic<00:03:33.850> yeah<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.180> was

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
middle of an obesity epidemic yeah I was

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.810 
middle of an obesity epidemic yeah I was
reading<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:35.990> we<00:03:36.200> eat<00:03:36.440> an<00:03:36.650> enormous<00:03:37.460> amount

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
reading that we eat an enormous amount

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.210 
reading that we eat an enormous amount
of<00:03:37.940> sugar<00:03:38.210> it<00:03:39.080> will<00:03:39.230> surprise<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.830> that's<00:03:40.100> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
of sugar it will surprise you that's the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.690 
of sugar it will surprise you that's the
average<00:03:40.400> child<00:03:41.090> about<00:03:41.540> my<00:03:41.870> eight<00:03:42.170> eat<00:03:42.800> double

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
average child about my eight eat double

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.170 
average child about my eight eat double
their<00:03:43.940> weight<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.360> sugar<00:03:44.720> that's<00:03:45.530> about<00:03:46.180> 140

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
their weight in sugar that's about 140

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.660 
their weight in sugar that's about 140
pounds<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.750> sugar<00:03:47.930> per<00:03:48.290> year<00:03:48.560> which<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.250> more

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
pounds of sugar per year which is more

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.470 
pounds of sugar per year which is more
than<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:50.450> pound<00:03:50.810> every<00:03:51.410> three<00:03:51.740> days<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:53.030> it's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
than one pound every three days and it's

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.840 
than one pound every three days and it's
not<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:54.050> kids<00:03:54.320> even<00:03:54.710> adults<00:03:55.220> are<00:03:55.550> eating

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
not just the kids even adults are eating

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.060 
not just the kids even adults are eating
about<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.090> hundred<00:03:56.510> pounds<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.260> sugar<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.830> year

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
about a hundred pounds of sugar a year

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.210 
about a hundred pounds of sugar a year
which<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:58.910> unbelievable<00:03:59.900> how<00:04:00.410> do<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.620> consume

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
which is unbelievable how do you consume

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.360 
which is unbelievable how do you consume
all<00:04:01.460> this<00:04:01.670> sugar<00:04:01.910> where<00:04:02.750> does<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:02.990> come<00:04:03.290> from

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
all this sugar where does it come from

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.390 
all this sugar where does it come from
it<00:04:04.370> must<00:04:04.670> be<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.000> everything<00:04:05.570> we<00:04:05.750> eat<00:04:05.780> right

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it must be in everything we eat right

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.700 
it must be in everything we eat right
well<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:08.000> sugar<00:04:08.300> in<00:04:08.510> practically<00:04:09.020> every<00:04:09.290> food

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
well the sugar in practically every food

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.160 
well the sugar in practically every food
you<00:04:09.830> can<00:04:10.040> imagine<00:04:10.280> except<00:04:10.880> for<00:04:10.910> me<00:04:11.330> or<00:04:11.630> oil<00:04:11.840> or

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
you can imagine except for me or oil or

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.860 
you can imagine except for me or oil or
butter<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.880> but<00:04:13.880> let's<00:04:14.120> be<00:04:14.270> clear<00:04:14.300> there<00:04:14.840> are

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
butter and but let's be clear there are

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.500 
butter and but let's be clear there are
foods<00:04:15.320> that<00:04:15.470> have<00:04:15.740> natural<00:04:16.730> sugars<00:04:17.150> such<00:04:17.330> as

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
foods that have natural sugars such as

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.750 
foods that have natural sugars such as
fruits<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.140> vegetables<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.220> those<00:04:19.580> are

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
fruits and vegetables and those are

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.390 
fruits and vegetables and those are
different<00:04:20.180> than<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.510> added<00:04:21.200> sugars<00:04:21.859> which

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
different than the added sugars which

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.850 
different than the added sugars which
come<00:04:22.729> from<00:04:23.060> different<00:04:23.479> sources<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:24.290> white

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
come from different sources like white

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.640 
come from different sources like white
sugar

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
sugar

can we do the natural idea would be to

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.719 
can we do the natural idea would be to

get the food and missed me to stop

content<00:05:01.520> well<00:05:02.520> that's<00:05:03.030> not<00:05:03.240> really<00:05:03.300> worked

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
content well that's not really worked

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.439 
content well that's not really worked
out<00:05:04.020> really<00:05:04.350> well<00:05:04.560> before<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.639> food<00:05:05.880> industry

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
out really well before the food industry

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.779 
out really well before the food industry
has<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.660> mandate<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.260> sell<00:05:07.650> their<00:05:07.830> products<00:05:08.370> so

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
has a mandate to sell their products so

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.450 
has a mandate to sell their products so
if<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.389> tell<00:05:09.660> them<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.169> make<00:05:10.889> low<00:05:11.100> sugar

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
if you tell them to make low sugar

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.820 
if you tell them to make low sugar
products<00:05:11.880> they<00:05:12.330> will<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.139> there<00:05:13.470> are<00:05:13.590> also

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
products they will but there are also

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.680 
products they will but there are also
probably<00:05:14.400> going<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.669> put<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:14.970> something<00:05:15.210> even

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
probably going to put in something even

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.020 
probably going to put in something even
worse<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.289> them<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:16.560> us<00:05:16.949> just<00:05:17.520> look<00:05:17.729> at<00:05:17.910> the

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
worse in them for us just look at the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.719 
worse in them for us just look at the
zero<00:05:18.300> calorie<00:05:18.720> sodas<00:05:19.229> yeah<00:05:19.949> they<00:05:20.520> don't

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
zero calorie sodas yeah they don't

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.409 
zero calorie sodas yeah they don't
really<00:05:20.789> work<00:05:21.180> right<00:05:21.770> no<00:05:22.770> well<00:05:23.580> while<00:05:24.180> there's

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
really work right no well while there's

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.089 
really work right no well while there's
nothing<00:05:24.750> really<00:05:24.960> wrong<00:05:25.110> with<00:05:25.410> wanting<00:05:25.919> to

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
nothing really wrong with wanting to

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.460 
nothing really wrong with wanting to
reduce<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.729> calories<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.360> your<00:05:27.389> drinks<00:05:27.900> the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
reduce the calories in your drinks the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.290 
reduce the calories in your drinks the
sweeteners<00:05:29.039> get<00:05:29.340> us<00:05:29.430> used<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.760> having<00:05:30.090> sweet

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
sweeteners get us used to having sweet

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.960 
sweeteners get us used to having sweet
things<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.169> later<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:31.919> also<00:05:32.160> want<00:05:32.550> something

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
things so later we also want something

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.760 
things so later we also want something
with<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.180> lot<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.449> sugar<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.050> we<00:05:34.440> end<00:05:34.650> up

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
with a lot of sugar and we end up

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.530 
with a lot of sugar and we end up
gaining<00:05:35.220> weight

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.170 

I<00:05:42.600> think<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.590> message<00:05:43.860> here<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:44.820> we

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
I think the message here is that we

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.910 
I think the message here is that we
should<00:05:45.390> know<00:05:45.540> what<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.930> healthy<00:05:46.350> sugars<00:05:46.710> are

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
should know what the healthy sugars are

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.700 
should know what the healthy sugars are
and<00:05:47.190> what's<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.640> unhealthy<00:05:48.420> sugars<00:05:48.780> are<00:05:49.020> we

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
and what's the unhealthy sugars are we

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.400 
and what's the unhealthy sugars are we
should<00:05:49.950> know<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.370> truly<00:05:51.030> food<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.900> becoming

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
should know that truly food is becoming

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.670 
should know that truly food is becoming
an<00:05:52.590> addiction<00:05:52.970> by<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.030> way<00:05:54.330> my<00:05:54.900> next<00:05:55.200> video<00:05:55.530> is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
an addiction by the way my next video is

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.950 
an addiction by the way my next video is
on<00:05:55.830> food<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.430> Kim<00:05:56.640> so<00:05:57.030> be<00:05:57.390> sure<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.600> check
