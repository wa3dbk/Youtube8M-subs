00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
think about differently about our

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.580 
think about differently about our
equipment<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:29.070> far<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.609> maybe<00:00:29.970> I'm

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
equipment as far as like maybe I'm

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.810 
equipment as far as like maybe I'm
things<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> wouldn't<00:00:32.009> normally<00:00:32.309> get

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
things that wouldn't normally get

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
things that wouldn't normally get
checked<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> between<00:00:33.899> repacks<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.590> maybe<00:00:34.770> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
checked in between repacks that maybe we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
checked in between repacks that maybe we
need<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> think<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.300> yeah<00:00:36.540> well<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
need to think more about how yeah well I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
need to think more about how yeah well I
think<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:38.070> regardless<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
think that it regardless of what the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240 
think that it regardless of what the
repack<00:00:39.270> cycle<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.290> user<00:00:40.559> needs<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
repack cycle is the user needs to take a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
repack cycle is the user needs to take a
greater<00:00:41.579> responsibility<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.570> we've

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
greater responsibility then we've

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
greater responsibility then we've
developed<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> culture<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> our<00:00:44.399> habit<00:00:45.000> has

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
developed as a culture and our habit has

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
developed as a culture and our habit has
been<00:00:45.360> well<00:00:45.870> that's<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.289> rigger<00:00:46.469> thing<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.920> not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

truth is the rigger only sees it once in
a<00:00:53.160> while<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.699> job<00:00:53.910> every<00:00:54.120> jump<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.170> look

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and you've got that reserve pin popping

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
and you've got that reserve pin popping
as<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.890> climbing<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> reserve

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
as you're climbing out in the reserve

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.100 
as you're climbing out in the reserve
pilot<00:01:21.180> chute<00:01:21.330> pops<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> tail<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
pilot chute pops over the tail and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
pilot chute pops over the tail and
you're<00:01:22.380> dangling<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> tail<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you're dangling from the tail of the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.710 
you're dangling from the tail of the
otter<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:27.119> wish<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
otter you go up and I really wish that I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.740 
otter you go up and I really wish that I
had<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> reserve<00:01:28.350> cutaway<00:01:28.770> handle<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
had a reserve cutaway handle right and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
had a reserve cutaway handle right and
so<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.860> me<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> big<00:01:32.340> one

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
so you get that to me that's the big one

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.300 
so you get that to me that's the big one
is<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.700> depends<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.509> migrate<00:01:33.960> around

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
is it depends will migrate around

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
is it depends will migrate around
obviously<00:01:35.310> depending<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.360> well<00:01:36.630> they

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
obviously depending on how well they

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
obviously depending on how well they
load<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> closing<00:01:37.890> loop<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.729> they

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
load up that closing loop not when they

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
load up that closing loop not when they
pack<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> reserve<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:40.170> things<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.740> settle

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
pack the reserve it things will settle

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
pack the reserve it things will settle
obviously<00:01:41.610> there's<00:01:41.759> air<00:01:42.000> coming<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
obviously there's air coming out of the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
obviously there's air coming out of the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
reserve over time when you get out

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.789 
reserve over time when you get out
closer<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> six<00:01:45.210> months<00:01:45.420> things<00:01:46.290> settle<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
closer to six months things settle the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
closer to six months things settle the
pilot<00:01:47.100> chute<00:01:47.250> stands<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.119> now

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pilot chute stands up more and now

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.039 
pilot chute stands up more and now
there's<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.880> slack<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> closing<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
there's more slack in the closing and so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.990 
there's more slack in the closing and so
the<00:01:52.140> pin<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.740> slide<00:01:53.070> around<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.579> bit<00:01:53.759> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the pin can slide around a little bit so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
the pin can slide around a little bit so
push<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.630> pin<00:01:54.780> back<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> double<00:01:55.470> check<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
push your pin back and double check that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
push your pin back and double check that

f-111 pile of shoes they have true I am
for<00:02:41.270> more<00:02:41.390> than<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:41.660> reason<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.319> that

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
for more than one reason one is that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.100 
for more than one reason one is that
like<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.310> said<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.700> got<00:02:43.850> much<00:02:44.630> more<00:02:44.780> friction

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
like we said it's got much more friction

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.620 
like we said it's got much more friction
so<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.800> stays<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.100> pouch<00:02:46.280> easier<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
so it stays in the pouch easier the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.199 
so it stays in the pouch easier the
other<00:02:47.810> part<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.980> find<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.489> 0p<00:02:49.910> pilot

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
other part is that we find that 0p pilot

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.880 
other part is that we find that 0p pilot
roots<00:02:50.360> are<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> little<00:02:50.690> more<00:02:50.959> nervous<00:02:51.500> on

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
roots are a little more nervous on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.490 
roots are a little more nervous on
deployment<00:02:52.519> in<00:02:52.580> other<00:02:52.730> words<00:02:52.940> they<00:02:53.150> oscillate

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
deployment in other words they oscillate

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.290 
deployment in other words they oscillate
because<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.620> grabs<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:55.220> air<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:55.730> efficiently

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
because they grabs a air so efficiently

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.090 
because they grabs a air so efficiently
and<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.840> think<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.110> around<00:02:57.319> parachute<00:02:57.950> if

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
and you think of it around parachute if

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.320 
and you think of it around parachute if
you've<00:02:58.220> got<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> round<00:02:58.670> parachute<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.090> no

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
you've got a round parachute with no

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.600 
you've got a round parachute with no
apex<00:02:59.900> event<00:03:00.050> no<00:03:00.500> hole<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.160> middle<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.459> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
apex event no hole in the middle of it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.520 
apex event no hole in the middle of it
it<00:03:01.760> swings<00:03:02.420> back<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.690> forth<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.350> get

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
it swings back and forth and you get

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.620 
it swings back and forth and you get
pretty<00:03:03.739> damn<00:03:03.950> nauseous<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.209> cut<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> hole

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
pretty damn nauseous so you cut a hole

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.699 
pretty damn nauseous so you cut a hole
in<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> middle<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:06.080> dampens<00:03:06.530> those

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
in the middle of dampens those

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.680 
in the middle of dampens those
oscillations<00:03:06.950> which<00:03:07.940> improves<00:03:08.420> its

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
oscillations which improves its

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.630 
oscillations which improves its
efficiency<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.350> every<00:03:09.590> way<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.519> overall

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
efficiency in every way so the overall

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.309 
efficiency in every way so the overall
descent<00:03:11.120> rate<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.450> actually<00:03:11.660> diminished<00:03:12.170> too

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
descent rate is actually diminished too

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.460 
descent rate is actually diminished too
so<00:03:13.100> when<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.850> look<00:03:13.970> at<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.540> f-111<00:03:14.959> pilot

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so when you look at the f-111 pilot

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.170 
so when you look at the f-111 pilot
you'd<00:03:15.620> it's<00:03:15.739> actually<00:03:15.980> leaking<00:03:16.400> air<00:03:16.760> through

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.930 
you'd it's actually leaking air through
the<00:03:17.299> pores<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.780> fabric<00:03:18.170> which<00:03:18.730> well<00:03:19.730> I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
the pores in the fabric which well I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.090 
the pores in the fabric which well I
would<00:03:20.209> guess<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.350> reason<00:03:21.680> why<00:03:21.799> they

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
would guess is the the reason why they

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.830 
would guess is the the reason why they
the<00:03:22.340> f-111<00:03:22.610> pilot<00:03:23.090> chute<00:03:23.209> seems<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.570> deploy

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the f-111 pilot chute seems to deploy

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.960 
the f-111 pilot chute seems to deploy
straighter<00:03:24.350> they<00:03:24.980> seem<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.190> give<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.489> more<00:03:25.730> on

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
straighter they seem to give you more on

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.030 
straighter they seem to give you more on
handing<00:03:26.480> openings<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.170> do<00:03:27.380> have<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.739> go<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.920> a

handing openings you do have to go to a
little<00:03:28.310> bit<00:03:28.430> bigger<00:03:28.640> one<00:03:29.230> compared<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.410> 0p

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
little bit bigger one compared to the 0p

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.350 
little bit bigger one compared to the 0p
in<00:03:30.980> order<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> get<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.489> same<00:03:31.700> extraction

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
in order to get the same extraction

bridle right longer bridle gives you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.770 
bridle right longer bridle gives you
better<00:03:40.250> openings<00:03:40.700> also<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.209> wingsuit<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
better openings also the wingsuit the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.120 
better openings also the wingsuit the
base<00:03:41.900> coupe<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.260> people<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.769> all<00:03:42.920> realized

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
base coupe you people have all realized

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.069 
base coupe you people have all realized
the<00:03:43.430> same<00:03:43.609> thing<00:03:43.940> when<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> pilot<00:03:44.720> chute<00:03:44.959> is

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
the same thing when the pilot chute is

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.960 
the same thing when the pilot chute is
further<00:03:45.380> from<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.890> when<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.250> hits<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.640> pin

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
further from you when it hits that pin

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.410 
further from you when it hits that pin
it's<00:03:47.329> out<00:03:48.079> of<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.500> verbal<00:03:48.859> or<00:03:49.790> more<00:03:50.060> out<00:03:50.390> of

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
it's out of the verbal or more out of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.960 
it's out of the verbal or more out of
the<00:03:50.780> verbal<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.709> get<00:03:52.010> more<00:03:52.280> snatch<00:03:52.640> force

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
the verbal and you get more snatch force

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.180 
the verbal and you get more snatch force
so<00:03:53.480> it's<00:03:53.750> contributing<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.709> good<00:03:54.829> openings

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
so it's contributing to a good openings

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.860 
so it's contributing to a good openings
so<00:03:55.730> yeah<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.150> then<00:03:56.329> we've<00:03:56.480> talked<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
so yeah and then we've talked in the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.319 
so yeah and then we've talked in the
past<00:03:57.079> also<00:03:57.410> about<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.489> three<00:03:58.670> ring<00:03:58.850> system

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
past also about the three ring system

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.430 
past also about the three ring system
maybe<00:03:59.480> that's<00:03:59.720> something<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.109> we<00:04:00.290> need<00:04:00.410> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
maybe that's something that we need to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.319 
maybe that's something that we need to
make<00:04:00.680> sure<00:04:00.709> we're<00:04:01.100> absolutely<00:04:01.519> keep<00:04:02.000> looking

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
at it make sure you continue to flex it

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.819 
at it make sure you continue to flex it

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
especially if it's gotten moist that
