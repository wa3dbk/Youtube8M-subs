00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
cool for me was the Osiris that was the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
cool for me was the Osiris that was the
main<00:00:32.129> vehicle<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.730> enjoyed<00:00:33.120> other<00:00:33.840> than

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
ready to each their own but for me it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
ready to each their own but for me it
was<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> Osiris<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.839> everything<00:00:42.839> else<00:00:43.170> in

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
was the Osiris and everything else in

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.149 
was the Osiris and everything else in
the<00:00:44.399> update<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.359> pretty<00:00:45.659> expensive<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.979> in

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
the update was pretty expensive it's in

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.079 
the update was pretty expensive it's in
this<00:00:47.339> has<00:00:47.489> probably<00:00:47.699> been<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> most

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
this has probably been the most

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.539 
this has probably been the most
expensive<00:00:48.569> DLC<00:00:49.139> I<00:00:49.170> believe<00:00:49.559> we've<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:50.039> since

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
expensive DLC I believe we've had since

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.779 
expensive DLC I believe we've had since
I<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:52.139> even<00:00:52.229> know<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.679> don't<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.190> any<00:00:53.309> dlc

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I don't even know I don't think any dlc

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.399 
I don't even know I don't think any dlc
comes<00:00:54.030> close<00:00:54.299> to<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.629> we've<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.079> deal

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
comes close to what we've had to deal

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.799 
comes close to what we've had to deal
with<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.769> this<00:00:55.920> DLC<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.690> example<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.780> got

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
like the Luxor deluxe that one was 10

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.349

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
we really got at a difference at least

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070 
we really got at a difference at least
from<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.860> noticed<00:01:08.370> was<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.330> Luxor

from what I noticed was that the Luxor
deluxe<00:01:10.440> was<00:01:10.650> basically<00:01:11.070> gold<00:01:11.400> painted<00:01:11.820> over

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480

the<00:01:12.930> regular<00:01:13.200> deluxe<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.640> just

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the regular deluxe or which was just

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.970 
the regular deluxe or which was just
black<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.540> grey<00:01:15.780> whatever<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.740> black

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
black or grey whatever it was black

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.820 
black or grey whatever it was black
mostly<00:01:17.810> also<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.050> that<00:01:19.200> Swift<00:01:19.500> deluxe

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
mostly also we got that Swift deluxe

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820 
mostly also we got that Swift deluxe
which<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.790> meager<00:01:21.630> five<00:01:22.470> million

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
which was a pretty meager five million

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
which was a pretty meager five million
dollars<00:01:23.430> five<00:01:23.700> million<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.630> hundred<00:01:24.660> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
dollars five million one hundred and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.520 
dollars five million one hundred and
fifty<00:01:25.260> thousand<00:01:25.950> dollars<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.290> pretty

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fifty thousand dollars that was pretty

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
fifty thousand dollars that was pretty
pricey<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.640> basically<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.300> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pricey the same thing basically as the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.860 
pricey the same thing basically as the
swift<00:01:31.700> swift<00:01:32.700> helicopter<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.690> only

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
swift swift helicopter the only

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.930 
swift swift helicopter the only
difference<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.220> gold<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
difference was this one is in gold I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.770 
difference was this one is in gold I
guess<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.870> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.620> mean<00:01:38.060> really<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
guess right so I mean really what is the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.270 
guess right so I mean really what is the
price<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.050> we're<00:01:40.320> gonna<00:01:40.410> have<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.830> pay<00:01:41.010> for

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
price that we're gonna have to pay for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300 
price that we're gonna have to pay for
the<00:01:41.430> dlc<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.080> ill-gotten<00:01:43.410> gains<00:01:43.980> part

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the dlc of the ill-gotten gains part

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
the dlc of the ill-gotten gains part
number<00:01:44.550> two<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.420> feel<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.600> we're

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
number two I really feel like we're

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
number two I really feel like we're
gonna<00:01:45.900> be<00:01:46.050> paying<00:01:46.440> pretty<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> same<00:01:47.550> if

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
gonna be paying pretty much the same if

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.790 
gonna be paying pretty much the same if
not<00:01:47.880> somewhat<00:01:48.600> close<00:01:49.020> maybe<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.620> bit

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
not somewhat close maybe a little bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.160 
not somewhat close maybe a little bit
less<00:01:49.980> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.300> Rockstar<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.960> keep

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
less but I think Rockstar is gonna keep

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.480 
less but I think Rockstar is gonna keep
it<00:01:52.320> general<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.800> think<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.070> reason<00:01:53.250> why

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it general and I think the reason why

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
it general and I think the reason why
they're<00:01:53.670> doing<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.300> because<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:55.140> want

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they're doing this is because they want

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140 
they're doing this is because they want
to<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.530> who's<00:01:55.740> gonna<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.640> spending<00:01:57.030> this

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
to see who's gonna be spending this

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.899 
to see who's gonna be spending this

number two I think this was gonna be

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.810 
number two I think this was gonna be
somewhat<00:03:54.740> close<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.190> same<00:03:55.400> price<00:03:55.580> than
