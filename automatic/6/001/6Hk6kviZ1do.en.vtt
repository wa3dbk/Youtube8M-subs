00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.010
 and 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.510
 hello everyone here reason 'welcome to 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.820
 channel and welcome to the new gaming news 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.310
 today is Tuesday 10 February 17 if I do not 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.750
 I'm wrong before commenting on the news 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.700
 most important today 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.990
 there has not been much content either 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.910
 well I tried to keep that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.440
 what else could you be interested in just 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.300
 I wanted to remind you that tonight 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.770
 you will have a new top 5 on the channel that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.960
 I hope you like it and that you throw it a 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.610
 look and good with nothing more to add 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.260
 Let's go directly to comment on what they are 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.620
 the most important news of the day of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.850
 today 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.199
 so let's start first 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.640
 talking a little bit about are and is that 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.559
 on this occasion you have to refer 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.290
 to some statements that they have made 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.370
 recently in relation to certain 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.980
 problems that the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.500
 company in the sector or the region best 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.680
 said of North America and although it did not come 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.149
 In this interview, they have 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.670
 made again the claim that 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.530
 So many times have we heard the last 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.969
 guardian is still developing is not a 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.469
 great news is not great news 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.479
 because as I say we have already heard 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.670
 different in different occasions from 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.710
 different people or managers of sony 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.600
 but hey they say it's still 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.729
 development we are not seeing new 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.130
 content we do not know when it's going to come out 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.570
 we do not even know if it's for 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.370
 Playstation 4 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 if they are already considering the possibility of 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.510
 a next platform we do not know 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.070
 but they are good and he says he is still 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.810
 development and that develops 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.520
 correctly the video game so 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.400
 we will have to believe them as soon as there is more 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.750
 content or more audiovisual details 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700
 especially a new trailer or new 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.619
 images I will start to believe it until 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 then we will see and without leaving aside 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.740
 the theme of playstation 4 we have to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.610
 continue talking a little about another 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 video game that is going to be released 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 as soon imminently 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 who says on that platform in this 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.619
 case it's about dior of 1886 a title 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.890
 that has a release date 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.770
 scheduled for February 20 in 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.180
 scarcely three days as he says is the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.130
 that is the official release date 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.690
 I know that in some places you are already 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.390
 selling I know there are people who already 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.369
 has but officially it 's day 20 and 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.960
 that's what matters to me 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.910
 personally but good in this case 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.800
 as many of you will know these last 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.090
 days there has been some controversy because 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 there were people who had already passed the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.940
 game in only 4 or 5 hours 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.739
 approximately and the developers in 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.450
 this case ready at dawn which is the name 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.280
 of the developer has not done 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.020
 no grace and in fact recently 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.210
 have made a statement in which 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.730
 they assure you that the story mode 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.040
 campaign of this video game lasts between 8 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.660
 and 10 hours nothing of four or five hours 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 as some people said I 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.560
 obviously not in the past 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.770
 so I can not tell you how long it lasts 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.930
 but I do not rule out relatively inside 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.100
 little that you can see it in the channel and it's 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.170
 that there are going to be very important changes 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
 around that issue and I shall tell more 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.070
 forward but in the end I just wanted 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.380
 inform you of this little news and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.270
 I will warn you that you may see it in 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 the channel we'll see we continue now 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.880
 with another news that in this case has 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.590
 what to do with closing and that is 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.480
 recently the creators of this 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.940
 videogames have announced a new title 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.650
 known as terrarium other world fits 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.530
 point out that the developers themselves 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 they assure that it is not a terror sequel 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.500
 no longer an expansion of one's own 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.840
 video game but something completely 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.210
 different even though he shares 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.760
 obvious way certain mechanics the 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.500
 appearance the gameplay could finally 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.970
 say it 's almost a continuation 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.800
 but they assure that it is something 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 completely different but good from 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.650
 moment they have shown us only the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.930
 trailer that you have on screen that lasts 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.300
 something less than a minute and has no date 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.410
 of launch but it's already supposed to be 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.200
 know on the platforms for 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.850
 what will come out in this case pc and mac 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.500
 training for sure hundred and also 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.600
 the possibility that it comes out 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.700
 for playstation 4 and xbox one as soon as 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.780
 there are more details I will comment we will continue 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.340
 now commenting a little bit about the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.600
 franchise of dragon ball and is that in 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.490
 this occasion you have to make reference to 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.920
 the next delivery that will come out inside 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.600
 You're welcome on February 27, well-known 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.130
 like dragon ball is not seen in which 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.130
 will be available for platforms 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.680
 of playstation 3 playstation 4 360 xbox 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.210
 one and computer that in fact when 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.650
 talk about the platforms in the video 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.360
 releases this month committed a 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.860
 small mistake so I apologize 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.210
 but well those are the platforms 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.980
 officers where you will be 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.090
 available and in this case what you have to 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.680
 comment is that a new one has come out 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.420
 quite extensive trailer of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.620
 approximately 6 minutes and we have 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.420
 the same on screen and that also 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.980
 I will leave in the description if we like the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.299
 video game if you are interested do not hesitate in 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.590
 take a look and apolitical for 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.209
 finish a small note that in this 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.250
 case has to do with the bay no fisac 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.070
 rivers a title that has received 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.690
 quite popular in the past 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.520
 months and I actually brought the channel in 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.170
 different occasions and maybe inside 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.420
 of little you also see more content of it 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.520
 well in this case recently the 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.260
 creator of this video game has announced 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.680
 and the first details of after 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.450
 in the first expansion of this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.830
 reinvestment of the original video game that 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.570
 he already announced us a few months ago 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 but that in this case already ensures that 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.430
 this expansion will offer between 100 and 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.230
 200 hours of new content in fact 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.490
 ensures that there will be more than 100 new 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.740
 items a new game mode 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.510
 completely different 10 new types 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.300
 of challenges a new character 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.950
 controllable also a new ending and a 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.080
 a lot of content that will affect 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.910
 all to the gameplay and design of the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.190
 maps as new enemies or 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.320
 directly new areas within the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.850
 own levels in the end promises quite 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.370
 this expansion is not known at the moment 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.720
 exactly when it's going to come out is supposed 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.430
 that in the middle of this year but in 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.810
 When there are more details we will comment 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.100
 and finally up to here someone minimum of 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.360
 Today I hope you liked it as

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.740
 too important but good depends 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.960
 of the day, it's not me who decides what 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.520
 news there is every day not much less and 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.230
