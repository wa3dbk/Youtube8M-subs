00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
period of time so you can see there's

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.500 
period of time so you can see there's
just<00:00:29.350> this<00:00:29.670> guy<00:00:30.670> bobbing<00:00:31.090> up<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.210> down<00:00:31.390> in

actually the antagonist of the game so

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.169 
actually the antagonist of the game so
if<00:00:37.780> we<00:00:37.870> just<00:00:38.050> jump<00:00:38.109> right<00:00:38.379> in<00:00:38.620> here<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.969> play

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
if we just jump right in here you play

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.069 
if we just jump right in here you play
as<00:00:40.359> this<00:00:40.600> all<00:00:40.989> over<00:00:41.229> here<00:00:41.589> ninja<00:00:42.489> ball<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.079> um

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
as this all over here ninja ball and um

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.799 
as this all over here ninja ball and um
your<00:00:44.530> controls<00:00:44.920> are<00:00:45.219> just<00:00:45.370> holding<00:00:46.059> down<00:00:46.089> w<00:00:46.659> to

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
your controls are just holding down w to

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.209 
your controls are just holding down w to
move<00:00:46.989> around<00:00:47.109> and<00:00:47.559> then<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.679> mouse<00:00:50.889> to

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
move around and then using the mouse to

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.819 
move around and then using the mouse to
sort<00:00:51.370> of<00:00:51.429> guide<00:00:51.639> your<00:00:52.059> ball<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.539> then<00:00:53.530> you've

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
sort of guide your ball and then you've

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.500 
sort of guide your ball and then you've
got<00:00:53.979> a<00:00:54.010> speed<00:00:54.370> boost<00:00:54.670> if<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.239> tap

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
got a speed boost if you just tap

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.079 
got a speed boost if you just tap
spacebar<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.409> you<00:00:56.889> can<00:00:57.010> also<00:00:57.129> break<00:00:57.489> holding

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
spacebar and you can also break holding

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.989 
spacebar and you can also break holding
shift<00:00:58.319> so<00:00:59.319> as<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> probably<00:00:59.769> guess<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.579> goal

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
shift so as you probably guess the goal

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.869 
shift so as you probably guess the goal
of<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.269> game<00:01:01.420> is<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:02.260> get<00:01:02.619> past<00:01:03.039> these<00:01:03.489> guys

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
of the game is to get past these guys

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.140 
of the game is to get past these guys
with<00:01:04.270> their<00:01:04.600> searchlights<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.910> can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
with their searchlights so you can

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.870 
with their searchlights so you can
either<00:01:07.300> sneak<00:01:07.720> past<00:01:07.960> them<00:01:08.230> or<00:01:08.700> another<00:01:09.700> thing

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
either sneak past them or another thing

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.450 
either sneak past them or another thing
ever<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.330> go<00:01:10.480> disposal<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.680> shuriken<00:01:12.220> Zoar

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
ever to go disposal is the shuriken Zoar

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.450 
ever to go disposal is the shuriken Zoar
ninja<00:01:12.820> stars<00:01:13.120> which<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.870> can<00:01:14.170> shoot<00:01:15.130> and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
ninja stars which you can shoot and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.750 
ninja stars which you can shoot and
bounce<00:01:16.240> off<00:01:16.480> things<00:01:16.870> to<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:20.760> assassinate

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
bounce off things to try assassinate

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.810 
bounce off things to try assassinate
these<00:01:22.060> enemies<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.070> were<00:01:24.190> any<00:01:24.280> good<00:01:24.370> at<00:01:24.580> this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
these enemies if I were any good at this

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.390 
these enemies if I were any good at this
have<00:01:25.150> able<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.600> bounce<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.500> off<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.010> barrel

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
have able to bounce this off the barrel

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.380 
have able to bounce this off the barrel
onto<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.360> wall<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:29.280> into<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.460> enemy<00:01:30.670> over

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
onto that wall and into the enemy over

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.770 
onto that wall and into the enemy over
there

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
there

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.650 
there
but<00:01:32.470> unfortunately<00:01:32.800> always<00:01:33.460> end<00:01:33.730> up<00:01:33.850> being

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
but unfortunately always end up being

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.010 
but unfortunately always end up being
extremely<00:01:34.840> bad<00:01:35.410> at<00:01:35.590> my<00:01:35.710> own<00:01:35.860> games<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:37.570> not

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
extremely bad at my own games that's not

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.630 
extremely bad at my own games that's not
gonna<00:01:38.140> happen<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.830> let's<00:01:42.040> just<00:01:42.250> never<00:01:42.460> get

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
gonna happen so let's just never get

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.490 
gonna happen so let's just never get
away<00:01:42.760> over<00:01:43.120> here<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.140> see<00:01:44.230> it's<00:01:44.350> still

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
away over here so you can see it's still

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
away over here so you can see it's still
in<00:01:44.680> quite<00:01:45.310> early<00:01:45.460> development

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
in quite early development

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.280 
in quite early development
I've<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.270> been<00:01:48.390> sort<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.689> putting<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I've just been sort of putting all the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
I've just been sort of putting all the
code<00:01:49.470> together<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> stuff<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:52.310> probably

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
code together and stuff it will probably

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
code together and stuff it will probably
be<00:01:53.460> another<00:01:53.759> 1<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.299> 2<00:01:54.479> weeks<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> development

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
be another 1 or 2 weeks and development

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
be another 1 or 2 weeks and development
and<00:01:55.470> they'll<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.830> back<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.399> working<00:01:56.939> full-time

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and they'll go back to working full-time

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:06.560 
and they'll go back to working full-time

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
at this stage although at the moment is

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.430 
at this stage although at the moment is
not<00:02:22.739> very<00:02:23.130> challenging<00:02:23.670> basically<00:02:24.269> just<00:02:24.480> jump

I<00:02:31.380> designed<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.069> level<00:02:32.670> better<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.959> will<00:02:34.110> grow

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
I designed the level better it will grow

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.580
