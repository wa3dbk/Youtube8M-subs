 blacks left the first time without 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.769
 the big difference in the scoreboard was

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.869

 to 10 at the eden park stadium with this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 Argentine defeat will not be able to defend the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.310
 third place in the world 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.260
 past france-2007 in new semifinals 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.390
 zealand will be measured with australia that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.330
 previously had eliminated the last 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.520
 champion south africa by 11 to 9 on the other 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.039
 key in both will cross France-Wales 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.719
 in the beginning of the party fairs and 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.820
 roncero were the standard - bearers of the 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.320
 resistance and the all blacks are 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.200
 they closed the roads to get to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.929
 ingoal the team of santiago phelan did 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 59 stable in the initial period against 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.880
 less than 30 of the premises that had dominance 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.890
 of ball and territory however to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 despite the care Argentine committed 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.329
 four penalties throughout the first 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.880
 period and weepu transformed 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.179
 invariably in so many that marked the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.009
 Argentine initial difference came out to 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.079
 dispute the New Zealander domain from the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.599
 beginning of the complement and marcelo bosch 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.599
 with a good penalty from midfield 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.509
 shortened the differences 12 to 10 but 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.159
 weepu four minutes later infallible 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.200
 in the penalties he brought back the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.360
 distance to five points 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 from there the place accentuated its 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 superiority and forced the cougars to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 dedicate exclusively to defense 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.010
 in the last 20 the all blacks 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.700
 liquidate of the meeting and closed the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.320
 match with a blunt 33 to 10 as 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.810
 they have us accustomed throughout 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.090
 your story once again the cougars 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.910
 they left everything but unfortunately this 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.949
 it did not reach 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.949
 [Applause]
