skates there isn't a lot of maintenance
you<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.679> with<00:00:10.830> your<00:00:10.950> skates<00:00:11.219> but

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
you have to do with your skates but

you have to do with your skates but
there<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> couple<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.240> things<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.660> are

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
there is a couple of things that are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.390 
there is a couple of things that are
important<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.290> keep<00:00:13.469> your<00:00:13.650> skates<00:00:13.920> working

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
important to keep your skates working

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.110 
important to keep your skates working
properly

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
properly

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
properly
primarily<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.170> need<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.160> keep

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
primarily what you need to do is to keep

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.340 
primarily what you need to do is to keep
an<00:00:17.609> eye<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.119> bearings<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> make<00:00:18.990> sure<00:00:19.170> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
an eye on the bearings to make sure that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.380 
an eye on the bearings to make sure that
they<00:00:19.470> haven't<00:00:19.650> rusted<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.279> rotate<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
they haven't rusted and rotate the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.910 
they haven't rusted and rotate the
wheels<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.810> let's<00:00:21.990> kind<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> talk<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
wheels so let's kind of talk about that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
wheels so let's kind of talk about that
rotating<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> wheels<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.269> very<00:00:24.539> important<00:00:24.990> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
rotating the wheels is very important in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.070 
rotating the wheels is very important in
line<00:00:25.260> skating<00:00:25.680> because<00:00:25.830> when<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.930> operate<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
line skating because when you operate a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.720 
line skating because when you operate a
skate<00:00:28.439> you're<00:00:28.710> always<00:00:28.890> pushing<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
skate you're always pushing on the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
skate you're always pushing on the
inside<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> wheel<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:31.619> will

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
inside of the wheel and so what will

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.440 
inside of the wheel and so what will
eventually<00:00:32.309> happen<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> wheel<00:00:33.270> will

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
eventually happen is the wheel will

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
eventually happen is the wheel will
become<00:00:33.719> angled<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.950> inside<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
become angled on the inside and if you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
become angled on the inside and if you
don't<00:00:36.059> rotate<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.660> wheels<00:00:36.899> you'll<00:00:37.200> actually

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
don't rotate your wheels you'll actually

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
don't rotate your wheels you'll actually
have<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> replace<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.430> wheels<00:00:38.960> way

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
have to replace your wheels way

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
have to replace your wheels way
prematurely<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:41.129> probably<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.940> half<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
prematurely by probably about half of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
prematurely by probably about half of
their<00:00:42.510> life<00:00:42.710> rotating<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> wheels<00:00:43.950> will

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
their life rotating the wheels will

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
their life rotating the wheels will
extend<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> life<00:00:44.640> by<00:00:44.969> almost<00:00:45.360> double<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
extend the life by almost double and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.799 
extend the life by almost double and
make<00:00:46.530> skate<00:00:46.950> skating<00:00:47.670> easier<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
make skate skating easier because as you

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
make skate skating easier because as you
start<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> angled<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.329> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
start to get that angled side on your

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
start to get that angled side on your
wheel<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.899> makes<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> much<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.469> difficult<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
wheel it makes it much more difficult to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
wheel it makes it much more difficult to
skate<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> rotate<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.719> reels

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
skate now when you rotate your reels

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
skate now when you rotate your reels
basically<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
basically what you want to do is you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
basically what you want to do is you
want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> take<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.539> wheels<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:58.079> starting

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
want to take your wheels off starting

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
want to take your wheels off starting
with<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> first<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> third<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
with the first and the third you want to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
with the first and the third you want to
flip<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> wheel<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> insides<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
flip the wheel around so the insides on

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
flip the wheel around so the insides on
the<00:01:03.600> outside<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> move<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the outside and you want to move the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
the outside and you want to move the
first<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> third<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> third<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
first to the third and the third to the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
first to the third and the third to the
first<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> front<00:01:08.640> wheel<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
first that's because the front wheel the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.179 
first that's because the front wheel the
skate<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.570> typically<00:01:09.930> wear<00:01:10.229> much<00:01:10.619> faster

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
skate will typically wear much faster

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
skate will typically wear much faster
than<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> middle<00:01:11.700> wheels<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.720> back

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
than the middle wheels and the back

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
than the middle wheels and the back
wheel<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.500> wear<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> second-fastest<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
wheel will wear the second-fastest so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.399 
wheel will wear the second-fastest so
what<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> both

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what we want to do is we want to both

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
what we want to do is we want to both
turn<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> inside<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> outside<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.150> move

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
turn the inside of the outside and move

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
turn the inside of the outside and move
the<00:01:18.840> front<00:01:19.080> wheels<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> back<00:01:19.680> wheels<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the front wheels and the back wheels to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
the front wheels and the back wheels to
the<00:01:20.430> middle<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> skate<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.600> again<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.830> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the middle of the skate so again so it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.870 
the middle of the skate so again so it's
not<00:01:23.070> too<00:01:23.220> complicated

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
not too complicated

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.469 
not too complicated
first<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> third<00:01:24.799> flip<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:25.920> over<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
first and third flip them over and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
first and third flip them over and
rotate<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.530> we've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.890> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
rotate them out and then we've got that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
rotate them out and then we've got that
done<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> second<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.090> fourth<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
done do the second and fourth so you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
done do the second and fourth so you
don't<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:30.990> mixed<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.380> again<00:01:31.979> flip<00:01:32.280> them

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
don't get them mixed up again flip them

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
don't get them mixed up again flip them
over<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> rotate<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.390> first<00:01:33.689> third

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
over and rotate them out first third

you inside your box you should have a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.649 
you inside your box you should have a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
hex tool like this one now if not you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.700 
hex tool like this one now if not you
probably<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> want<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> buy<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
probably are going to want to buy a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
probably are going to want to buy a
blade<00:01:44.100> tool<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> recommend<00:01:45.479> buying<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
blade tool actually I recommend buying a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
blade tool actually I recommend buying a
blade<00:01:46.049> tool<00:01:46.320> anyways<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
blade tool anyways because you need the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
blade tool anyways because you need the
blade<00:01:48.659> tool<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.140> order<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> bearing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
blade tool in order to get the bearing

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
blade tool in order to get the bearing
out<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:51.240> clean<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> bearings<00:01:52.170> or

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
out because you do clean the bearings or

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.789 
out because you do clean the bearings or
replace<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> bearings<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
replace the bearings you have to have

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
replace the bearings you have to have
this<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.189> device<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
this little device here to do it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
this little device here to do it
otherwise<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.810> difficult<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.799> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
otherwise it's very difficult when you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.899 
otherwise it's very difficult when you
take<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> wheel<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.700> you'll<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.479> wheel

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
take the wheel off you'll have a wheel

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
most bearings are sealed bearings so you

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.720 
most bearings are sealed bearings so you

do<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.010> want<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> put<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.489> bearings<00:03:11.209> back

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
do is you want to put the bearings back

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.180 
do is you want to put the bearings back
in<00:03:11.660> your<00:03:11.780> wheels<00:03:11.959> rotate<00:03:12.650> them<00:03:12.769> like<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:13.130> said

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
in your wheels rotate them like I said

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580 
in your wheels rotate them like I said
and<00:03:13.700> you're<00:03:13.850> pretty<00:03:14.090> much<00:03:14.269> ready<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.079> go<00:03:15.200> from

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
and you're pretty much ready to go from

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.259 
and you're pretty much ready to go from
your<00:03:15.709> rotation<00:03:16.250> making<00:03:16.579> sure<00:03:16.730> your<00:03:16.910> bearings

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
your rotation making sure your bearings

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.120 
your rotation making sure your bearings
are<00:03:17.389> okay<00:03:17.630> as<00:03:17.780> well<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.560> next<00:03:18.799> thing<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:18.980> want

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
are okay as well the next thing you want

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.449 
are okay as well the next thing you want
to<00:03:19.190> look<00:03:19.340> at<00:03:19.579> is<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.359> brake<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.250> brakes

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
to look at is the brake so the brakes

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.629 
to look at is the brake so the brakes
will<00:03:22.790> wear<00:03:23.500> generally<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.530> brake<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:25.010> good<00:03:25.280> for

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
will wear generally a brake is good for

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.259 
will wear generally a brake is good for
about<00:03:25.760> half<00:03:26.329> of<00:03:26.599> its<00:03:27.500> size<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.910> lot<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.209> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
about half of its size a lot of the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.789 
about half of its size a lot of the
brakes<00:03:29.450> have<00:03:29.690> actually<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.109> line<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.650> them

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
brakes have actually a line on them

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.589 
brakes have actually a line on them
telling<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.190> where<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.459> wear<00:03:31.609> point<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.090> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
telling you where the wear point is the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.180 
telling you where the wear point is the
more<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.930> brake<00:03:33.139> wears<00:03:33.470> though<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.950> more

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
more the brake wears though the more

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.770 
more the brake wears though the more
you'll<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.639> tilt<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> boot<00:03:35.180> up<00:03:35.419> in<00:03:35.599> order

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
you'll have to tilt the boot up in order

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.009 
you'll have to tilt the boot up in order
to<00:03:35.930> get<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.769> brake<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.190> hit<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.359> strongly

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
to get the brake to hit so I strongly

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.830 
to get the brake to hit so I strongly
recommend<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.799> purchase<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.660> backup<00:03:41.660> or

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
recommend that you purchase a backup or

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.020 
recommend that you purchase a backup or
second<00:03:42.290> brake<00:03:42.560> when<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.340> buy<00:03:43.489> your<00:03:43.639> skates

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
second brake when you buy your skates

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.670 
second brake when you buy your skates
not<00:03:44.599> only<00:03:44.810> will<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:44.959> mean<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.500> brake

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
not only will that mean that the brake

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
not only will that mean that the brake
is<00:03:45.829> there<00:03:46.160> when<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.459> need<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.450> many<00:03:47.750> times

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
is there when you need it but many times

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.629 
is there when you need it but many times
it's<00:03:48.169> hard<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.530> find<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.980> brakes<00:03:49.160> for<00:03:49.400> skate

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
it's hard to find the brakes for skate

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.220 
it's hard to find the brakes for skate
so<00:03:49.910> some<00:03:50.209> people<00:03:50.480> even<00:03:50.540> buy<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> couple<00:03:51.079> of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
so some people even buy a couple of

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.539 
so some people even buy a couple of
brakes<00:03:51.410> going<00:03:51.650> they'll<00:03:51.919> have<00:03:52.069> enough<00:03:52.310> brakes

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
brakes going they'll have enough brakes

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.430 
brakes going they'll have enough brakes
for<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.819> next<00:03:53.060> couple<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.359> years<00:03:53.419> in<00:03:53.930> case<00:03:54.319> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
for the next couple of years in case the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.259 
for the next couple of years in case the
manufacturer<00:03:54.980> stops<00:03:55.250> making<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.760> brake<00:03:56.000> or

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
manufacturer stops making that brake or

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.150 
manufacturer stops making that brake or
they're<00:03:56.690> hard<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> find<00:03:57.530> which<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.709> often<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
they're hard to find which is often the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.869 
they're hard to find which is often the
case

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
case

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.309 
case
that's<00:03:59.879> pretty<00:04:00.120> much<00:04:00.299> pretty<00:04:00.750> much<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.079> on<00:04:01.200> how

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
that's pretty much pretty much in on how

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.600 
that's pretty much pretty much in on how
to<00:04:01.379> take<00:04:01.590> care<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:02.010> skates<00:04:02.280> there's<00:04:02.489> not

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
to take care of your skates there's not

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.039 
to take care of your skates there's not
much<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.879> have<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.659> boots<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
much you have to do to the boots of the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.300 
much you have to do to the boots of the
frames<00:04:04.319> are<00:04:04.530> pretty<00:04:04.709> much<00:04:04.860> maintenance-free

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
frames are pretty much maintenance-free

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.649 
frames are pretty much maintenance-free
and<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.360> rotate<00:04:06.689> your<00:04:07.049> wheels<00:04:07.519> generally

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
and if you rotate your wheels generally

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.780 
and if you rotate your wheels generally
it<00:04:09.659> has<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.049> do<00:04:10.170> with<00:04:10.319> how<00:04:10.590> rough<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.250> surfaces

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it has to do with how rough the surfaces

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.910 
it has to do with how rough the surfaces
and<00:04:12.000> how<00:04:12.090> much<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.720> use<00:04:12.810> your<00:04:12.840> skate<00:04:13.290> just

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and how much you use your skate just

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800 
and how much you use your skate just
keep<00:04:14.189> an<00:04:14.370> eye<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.030> wheel<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.480> make<00:04:15.629> sure

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
keep an eye on the wheel to make sure

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.659 
keep an eye on the wheel to make sure
you<00:04:15.959> don't<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.259> that<00:04:16.380> angled<00:04:16.829> part<00:04:17.070> there's

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
you don't see that angled part there's

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.159 
you don't see that angled part there's
no<00:04:17.789> specific<00:04:18.269> time<00:04:18.479> frame<00:04:18.810> but<00:04:18.959> when<00:04:19.079> you

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
no specific time frame but when you

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.020 
no specific time frame but when you
start<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.100> wheel<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.699> angled

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
start to see that the wheel is angled

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.199 
start to see that the wheel is angled
it's<00:04:21.180> time<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.509> rotate<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.989> wheels
