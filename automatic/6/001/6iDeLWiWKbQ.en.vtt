00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.130
 before 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.260
 Hello, friends, how are you going to prepare a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910
 mashed potatoes with cod for this 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.400
 recipe we are going to use 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.520
 magical mashed potatoes an onion 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 minced black olive butter 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.770
 desalted cod and cherry tomatoes what 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.440
 first thing I'm going to do to start the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 recipe is to put the chopped onion to 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.750
 to fry, we put a little oil 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.320
 olive 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.750
 the onion and let it pray to fire 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.930
 slow meanwhile I already have here 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.090
 prepared a mixture of milk with water 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.890
 to make the mash I put it to 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.500
 to warm 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.420
 and when it's hot we 're going to add the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.190
 mashed potatoes once we have the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.309
 water and hot milk we are going to 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.399
 proceed to put the mashed potatoes what 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.290
 pour the whole package following the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.370
 instructions 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.280
 we submerged the mashed potato and now what 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.519
 let's let it rest a minute we put 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.049
 a pinch of salt the butter 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.420
 and we are mixing it vigorously until 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.750
 that we are totally uniform 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.750
 mixture 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020
 i 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.770
 and we will continue with the rest of the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.710
 ingredients we cut the tomatoes and if 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.420
 we do not want to put tomatoes 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 use other ingredients that are going 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.330
 well to this puree some vegetable 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.159
 then the black olives and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.189
 Then we will put the cod on 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.860
 cod as it has the skin first you 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 we remove the skin we put the knife 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.720
 in this way we hold the skin 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 in this way so easy we take it off 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.159
 now we do not cut 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.640
 to strips 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.810
 and very carefully placing the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 hands we are doing small pieces 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.849
 we join with the rest of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.849
 ingredients 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.260
 and we will only need to add our 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.520
 onion that we have it worse I walk once 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.880
 we have cold the onion we add 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.280
 to the set 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.280
 and we mix all the ingredients well 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.320
 They damaged a little bit of olive oil 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.320
 a pinch of pepper 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.210
 and before serving, let's try 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.980
 we have put little salt because think 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.350
 that the cod already has the point of salt 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.650
 and it is always advisable not to put too much 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.650
 quantity 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.680
 perfect now we place the mash that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.720
 we are going to use a metal ring that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.320
 I have put a little oil so that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.920
 then come out better put it in the center 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.920
 of the plate 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.860
 we are filling with the preparation 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.520
 we do a little bit of pressure so that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.520
 suits well 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.709
 we remove the ring 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.380
 we just decorated 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.380
 with some canons 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.750
 a domain tool now I'm going to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.569
 teach how to prepare a cherry tomato 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.959
 in an attractive way in the form of 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.959
 star 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.550
 we put a splash of olive oil 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.710
 we already have the cod chicken ready 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.230
 sure you will love it and remember 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.710
 that to taste with the life is to eat healthy and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.710
 simple 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.370
 no no
