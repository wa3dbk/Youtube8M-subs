teamwork<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:20.020> action<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.770> get<00:01:20.980> that<00:01:21.160> sense<00:01:21.430> of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
teamwork in action you get that sense of

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.820 
teamwork in action you get that sense of
camaraderie<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.540> that's<00:01:23.320> what<00:01:23.530> sports
