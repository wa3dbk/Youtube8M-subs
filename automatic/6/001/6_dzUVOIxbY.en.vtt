00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.810
 i dante grill 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.480
 I served as a special forces 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 britain i climbed everest and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.289
 I crossed the waters of the Arctic I show 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.099
 you need the skills to survive 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.099
 survive by any means 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.149
 with you dan the grill and today i will 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.550
 survive the crash of the Antarctic here is terrible 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.890
 cold but we have no special clothing is not 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.110
 allowing freezing parts of my body 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.630
 the challenge will be to show you how you can 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.770
 survive such conditions and finally find 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:14.960
 civilization drove that damn thing 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.970
 it's cold here but landed right in 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.259
 water needs to be heated immediately to 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180
 avoid dehydration 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.040
 to do this i will have to take off 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:36.860
 yourself all your clothes and as quickly as possible 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:38.990
 keep warm now is not yet 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.759
 blizzards need to move toward where 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.659
 camps can be located i 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.659
 going in that direction 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120
 he 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.700
 it seems to be starting to get dark urgently 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.660
 find a warm shelter somewhere in the gorge 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.060
 make a fire 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.710
 I was lucky nearby seemed fun 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 in which I could breed in rats 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 fire using a cream i have a little 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.410
 water in a flask 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.730
 and falsely enough for a while 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.380
 tomorrow we will go to the mountains to 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.510
 explore the area around 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.510
 and now i need to gain strength 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.989
 but 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:41.490
 It seems this night my fire has gone out 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 now we will climb this mountain think 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.160
 it will clearly see the landscape not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.930
 lag behind this mountain very easily 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.930
 tuck your leg or something else 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 go strictly in my footsteps not to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.300
 cause an avalanche or just not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.300
 fall off this ice slope 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.310
 while I was running away from the snow people, I managed 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 see that there is a camp in that country 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.590
 now i'm going there fluff finally 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.160
 I came across like her survival 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.160
 perch 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.269
 I'm afraid no longer have the strength to continue 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.390
 I 'll probably go back to the gorge 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.390
 behind
