00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.240
 I identify with Aku perfectly, as surely many others 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.960
 He is such a wonderful, perfect and diverse personality - 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.780
 just as we do, it's almost impossible to be unidentified to him 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
 The battery always improves my day 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.860
 If I get up on the wrong foot out of bed and from the morning all seems to go wrong - 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.980
 it is comforting to think that Akku is going even worse 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.300
 My day feels better right now 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.580
 Moniak's stuff, but I never look like things really are 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.060
 I don't want to draw any diary, but rather pick up small things - 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.100
 and edit them in a way appropriate to the situation 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.240
 I have drawn a lot of things in my own life 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.960
 Everyday situations where I queue up in a mail or grocery store with a full shopping cart 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.040
 I don't want to draw my life into a comic book as such, but filter it appropriately 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.960
 As a child, I dreamed about the profession of a cartoonist 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.140
 That dream came true 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.580
 I understand as an adult, how extraordinarily lucky I am - 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.620
 to really do this for my job 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.220
 I started drawing so young that it has always felt more playful than work 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.000
 It felt completely natural, as the play of children always feels like 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.960
 I didn't realize then how rare it was that the dream profession became the right profession 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.540
 I only understood it as an adult 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.140
 I might like to work in a cafe or bar 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.700
 The most comfortable work I could do with people all day 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.500
 The work of a cartoonist and scriptwriter, which I find absolutely impossible - 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.100
 and the only job I can do and want to do is 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.400
 is a very lonely job 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.900
 I have days alone, I concentrate on my work and fully immerse myself in my world 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.600
 I spend so much time in the Duck Castle that the right life is sometimes forgotten 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:40.780
 If I had to choose a new profession now, I would choose one who would take me to the people every day
