00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.549
 earth the sun and moon 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.570
 our old my moon is a face 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.570
 family in the starry sky 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 after all the moon is our closest neighbor 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.059
 next in space is only 360 thousand 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.620
 miles of us on moonlit nights is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.080
 the brightest light in the sky and the other light 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.470
 brightest in the sky and of course the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.730
 sun is farther away from the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.530
 than the moon to 150 million kilometers 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.430
 but as it is much larger 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.280
 seems to be the same size as the moon 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.500
 sun and the moon are not only the stars that 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.690
 we know how it has a strong influence 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.460
 about many events on earth one 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.140
 the most visible are tides 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.570
 in some places the tides may 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.930
 raise sea level by up to 15 meters 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.140
 in six hours what causes the tides is the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.880
 gravitational attraction of the moon and in 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.090
 sun degree the moon revolves around the earth 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 and its gravitational attraction causes a 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.680
 small protuberance on the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 Ocean 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.610
 the rotation of the earth produces a 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.060
 compensating protrusion on the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.520
 opposite of the planet with the earth rotating 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.860
 when the protuberance passes through a 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.070
 coastal area the water level rises 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.450
 creating the high tide 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.119
 when the coastal area is at the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.460
 farther from the protrusion 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.460
 of the water falls causing the low tide 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.350
 You can simulate a tide. 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.930
 using a container of water first 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.329
 mark the water level on the inner side 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.549
 the container and then turn the water 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.620
 in the vessel until a wave or 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.350
 protuberance of water to describe a 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 circle 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.799
 observe what happens in the brand in the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.989
 inside the container when the 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.130
 pass it 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.930
 write down 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.390
 actions in the first part of the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.390
 exercises in the book study plans 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.110
 if you intend to do this exercise 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.220
 Now turn off the VCR again 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.220
 call it when it's finished 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.090
 you should have noticed that every time the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.430
 wave passed by the mark the water level 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.800
 not only rose over the mark as if 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.970
 was a high tide as was also 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.890
 below the mark as at low tide 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.500
 the protuberance that causes navies 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.140
 of the ocean acts in the same way because 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.750
 in reality the protuberance is a wave 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.280
 with the high tide at its crest and the tide 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.280
 low in the dug part 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.050
 beyond the tides 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.980
 the sun and moon have other effects on 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.960
 earth like eclipses 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.390
 there are two types of eclipses 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.390
 the lunar eclipse and solar eclipse 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.340
 in the lunar eclipse the shadow of the earth is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.180
 projection on the moon occurs when the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.010
 earth lies between the moon and the on 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.700
 we can see the round door of the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.950
 the surface of the moon was 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.350
 addresses this shadow that has 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.470
 ancient Greek philosophers that the earth was 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 round 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.900
 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.900
 places between the earth and the sun 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.010
 the shadow of the moon projected on the surface 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.700
 of the land is only 260 kilometers 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.810
 width and moves at a speed of 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.810
 2.400 kilometers per hour 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.320
 for those who live in the area 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.510
 center of this shadow band the effect of 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.480
 an eclipse is spectacular 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.790
 the sun disappears slowly and when 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.110
 stay fully covered the day if 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.220
 turns night into hard darkness 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.220
 about seven minutes 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.720
 there is the impression that the moon covers 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.750
 almost exactly the sun and that's it 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.510
 that happens because although the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.540
 sun is about 400 times greater than 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.050
 the moon in the light of about 400 times more 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.729
 near land so seen from earth they 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.950
 seem to be more or less the same 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.290
 size 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.690
 you can calculate the actual size of the moon 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.280
 using who knows about their distance from 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.240
 earth in a window of the canopy you can see 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 the full moon 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.950
 take two pieces of electrical tape 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.310
 exactly two and a half centimeters 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.310
 other 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:39.090
 step away from the window until the moon fills 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.090
 exactly the space between the tapes 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.740
 in this distance between your eyes and 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.960
 the tapes 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.820
 note the results in the formula that 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.480
 appears in the second part of the 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.480
 Exercises 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.600
 the diameter of the moon image of two 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.000
 centimeters and a half is for distance 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.070
 from the tapes to your eyes as well as 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.690
 The real diameter of the moon is 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.690
 distance between the moon and the earth 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.250
 this technique to calculate the diameter of the 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.800
 moon may seem simple compared to 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.310
 to the complex instruments used 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.440
 currently by astronomers but have been 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.110
 simple techniques like these that 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.570
 made possible the Galilean and Copernican 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.430
 other astronomers of the past begin to 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.430
 understand the nature of the universe 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.270
 Hmm
