because<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> based

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
because it was really kind of based

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.450 
because it was really kind of based
around<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.270> tailed<00:00:36.600> beasts<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.980> tailed

like<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.030> three<00:02:00.060> months<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
like two or three months and then in

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.209 
like two or three months and then in
this<00:02:02.009> chapter<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.670> randomly<00:02:03.030> showed<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.689> page

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
this chapter they randomly showed a page

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
this chapter they randomly showed a page
how<00:02:05.219> he<00:02:05.280> enters<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> battlefield<00:02:06.270> again<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
how he enters the battlefield again and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580 
how he enters the battlefield again and
that's<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.340> only<00:02:08.450> bitch<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> him<00:02:10.349> in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's the only bitch we see of him in

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's the only bitch we see of him in
this<00:02:10.739> whole<00:02:10.950> chapter<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.690> kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> kind

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this whole chapter so kind of kind

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
this whole chapter so kind of kind
of<00:02:13.709> pointless<00:02:14.219> I<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.549> think<00:02:14.819> they<00:02:14.909> could

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
of pointless I can I think they could

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.149 
of pointless I can I think they could
have<00:02:15.150> saved<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.840> another<00:02:16.290> chapter

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
have saved that for another chapter

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.339 
have saved that for another chapter
maybe<00:02:17.579> added<00:02:17.969> something<00:02:18.209> more<00:02:18.510> relevant<00:02:18.989> to

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
maybe added something more relevant to

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.729 
maybe added something more relevant to
this<00:02:19.760> week's<00:02:20.760> chapter<00:02:21.299> maybe<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:22.019> like<00:02:22.290> all

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
it's a voltage ensure he's actually
