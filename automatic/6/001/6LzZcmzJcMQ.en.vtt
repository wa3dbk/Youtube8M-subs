00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.880
 two 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.460
 hello how about today's action guys and today 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.160
 we are in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.110
 online but it 's a bring a trick with the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.420
 which are we going to be able to equip us 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.099
 mask and helmet at the same time and so 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.439
 both have double protection 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.420
 bulletproof on the head and good for 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.610
 start telling you that we are going to need a 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.640
 quad and once we have it we give to 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.470
 select inventory accessories and we're going 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.390
 to helmets when we are in helmets 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.160
 we choose the one that we are going to equip in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.449
 my case in the old dash and what I 'm going 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
 to do is give the square to 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.489
 set it as default once 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.440
 I have it and now we have set what 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.270
 we have to do is put it back in 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.610
 none is to say take away all 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.450
 helmets and make sure that this option 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.620
 to wear the helmet is in itself 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.629
 now remind you that we are going to need 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.129
 which you do not need to buy it 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.289
 you can get it on the beach by 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.199
 tomorrow and the next step would be 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.759
 put on masks and look at the mask 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.220
 that we are going to put in my case is the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.840
 bulletproof and I know you're giving it two 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 times to the left therefore 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.259
 learn how many times do you have to 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.290
 give it to the right or to the left to 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.540
 choose the mask you want 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.160
 good as you see what I'm going to do is the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 mine the triangle and just when you see that 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.330
 my doll is taking out the helmet from 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.550
 I give my legs twice to the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.950
 left as it is the mask that 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.750
 I want to equip him and as you have seen if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.240
 just do it before the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.610
 will merge helmet is done 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.050
 basically the trick and to save it what 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.800
 The only thing we are going to do is give 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.150
 start on line and change character this 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.670
 It's going to take a little while since 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.130
 usually take the same character 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 with which you are playing and what is going to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.490
 to pass is that he is going to look for a game 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.800
 public and this public item always 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.270
 that you give to choose character and remember 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.729
 what do you have to take with you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 playing takes too long to find her but 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.780
 good here as you see what happened to camera 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.330
 fast I appear and what we are going to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.270
 do now is give select inventory 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.860
 and we 're going to go to accessories and how 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.840
 you see this option to wear a helmet 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.640
 which is taught before we put it in 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
 name and I'll show you how is the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.510
 merged helmet that in daylight no 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.700
 that looks much better and the truth is that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.040
 it looks like darth vader's is the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 Star Wars' and you will have the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.810
 double head protection and good 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.610
 that's all 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.620
