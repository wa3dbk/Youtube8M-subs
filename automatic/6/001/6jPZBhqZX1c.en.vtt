00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.429
 ego not mine in lifting 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.410
 discomfort in the back is one of the most frequent ailments 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.249
 associated with work 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.350
 usually 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.880
 Spinal injuries are caused by incorrect habits when performing the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 movement of materials and objects 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.150
 I observed some techniques below 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.000
 that will modify their work addicts helping to prevent injuries 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.430
 lifting techniques 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.069
 before moving a weight 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.069
 plan quickly how you will do your homework 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.860
 select the shortest route to move the load 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 check the path and remove all obstacles 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.910
 leaving enough space to comfortably pass 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.630
 you see obstacles that you can not remove 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 remember where they are 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 evaluate the characteristics of the load examine the object you are going to lift 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 set your weight and you went in seriously 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 if it exceeds its capacity 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.820
 do not lift 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.450
 I requested help from another employee and use mechanical equipment to facilitate 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 transfer 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.400
 always use safety elements according to the task 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 wear shoes that offer a good support surface and that have 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.810
 anti-slip characteristics 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.810
 Wear gloves to avoid hurting your hands 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.710
 load below the waist line 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.660
 Stand in front of the object as close as possible and stand your feet 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.560
 slightly to obtain a good airfoil 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.529
 I tried to keep supported by the entire floor of the feet 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 avoid lifting your heels 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.729
 As a general rule always bend your knees by squatting 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.979
 Keep your back as straight and life as possible 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 I took the object firmly with the palm of my hands 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:43.369
 belize an inspiration to contract the abdominal muscles and make the 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.409
 weight to your body 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.459
 always before lifting the load make the alleged photo and take them with the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.459
 Palms of the hands 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.719
 if you use only your fingers to lift the load 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 puts the health of your tendons at risk 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.099
 always use your legs to lift the floor 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.920
 the muscular effort must be carried out gently 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:25.639
 Lift the weight by strengthening the muscles of the legs and maintain the 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.639
 back as upright as possible 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.260
 never here from the column while you are holding a weight 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.239
 waist rotation is one of the main movements that damages the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.919
 back 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.129
 remember 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.969
 to change position I always rotated with your feet maintaining a posture 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.289
 upright 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.109
 You will notice that the work is facilitated and you will avoid serious injuries 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.489
 the load on the spine increases when the person bend extreme shape is 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.540
 forward the incorrect posture to lift weight represents an overload 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.370
 of the muscles of the back that are not prepared for an effort 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.939
 important 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.749
 when you lean forward or bend the column is pressing the discs 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.090
 intervertebral 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.479
 being able to produce 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.609
 painful injuries 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.609
 never lift weights with your back 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.439
 always do it with your legs 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 load between the waist and shoulders 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.039
 Position yourself as close to the load as possible 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.520
 I took the load with the palms of my hands and make the body 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.090
 I took an inspiration to contract the abdominal muscles 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.919
 Hold your breath and hold the weight using your arms flexed 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.559
 If you lift with arms outstretched you will be overloading 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.049
 unnecessarily the muscles of the back this incorrect posture can 

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:07.049
 cause permanent damage to your spine 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.429
 if the load is located above the level of the shoulders 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 it is convenient not to move it 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.530
 in these cases look for a platform to rise until the object is 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.830
 anniversary his waist
