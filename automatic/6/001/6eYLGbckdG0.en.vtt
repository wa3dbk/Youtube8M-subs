00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 by 10 friends youtube writers 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 cristian on the web or on twitter you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.280
 saw the trend that was created about the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.380
 s &amp; p and in this video I love you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 explain what is happening to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 tell them about the problem if you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
 wants to see that because I also think that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 It is important that you go to buy this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.510
 device know what it is about 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 this give you my opinion and try to see if 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.019
 you also give me your opinion let's 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.019
 to a madman and let's start with the video 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 the sprint is for those who do not know the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 s &amp; p is this little picture that is here of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 galaxy nov 5 of the new ones that always 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.280
 bring this stick 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.620
 and female I do not do not use it a lot 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.510
 but I think this this detail what 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.129
 is happening is important and that's why 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.860
 motivates me to make this video to talk 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.620
 of that what happens is that there is a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.650
 fault we could call it a failure 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.329
 of manufacture in the device why 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.610
 because if you take the s &amp; p 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.039
 in this way and what the way of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.259
 to put it is thus true entering it thus 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.300
 taking it out like this but if you put it on this 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.340
 way backwards more no longer who 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.320
 would it be so good that's the news and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 that 's why he opened by explaining if you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 he puts it is not something that I have invented 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 I only but if you put it on 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.580
 this way will enter 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.580
 I do not want it anyway 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 Wednesday 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.920
 I train - relax you come here in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.010
 I live my people do not have to enter it until 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.810
 in there already has something here that makes 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.910
 is caught that bad and this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.420
 device I think I sell not me 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.640
 I thought I'd meet him but look now 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.190
 do not come and even in notice 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.720
 guys I had not tried it because 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.630
 imagine you had not tried it there was no 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 tried I had seen and in the video I 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 I was just going to talk to them and I was going to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.550
 introduce I thought that I had to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 enter it up inside so that it 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.119
 get caught and notice that I did not have it 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 to go inside look up 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.140
 where he came in and he's already caught 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.970
 unfortunately I will not be able to record 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 the other images that make images 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.890
 to support the video by putting him there 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 it closes entering what went out yes yes yes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 yes yes now what they say is that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.370
 when you have it in the back you see 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.770
 that I do not enter it inside and if it 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 it got caught what they tell me is that 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.590
 is now 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.850
 It will not work when I take it out 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.230
 works does not register is damaged is damaged 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.870
 I do not know what I'm going to do, I'm going to take it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 and I'm going to say how good it was that it came 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.670
 because like I'm going to pay for this this 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.950
 it's not my fault that's a mistake of the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.450
 design in the others of bach and more no longer 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.460
 but imagine you are not supposed 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.040
 enter it so one day that you are in the 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.750
 night on the street you will not be 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.460
 seeing you can make a mistake and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.530
 try to enter what and how you 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.709
 they saw do not deliver it is inside and if 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.800
 it stays stuck and has damaged the sensor 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.950
 that does this function also that when 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.930
 you take it out there there would be a screen for 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.330
 start writing and now it 's that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.280
 sensor does not work I'm going to take it to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.160
 best buy and I'll say good dad 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 look here it does not work for me I'm seeing 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.800
 in the videos of youtube in those of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.709
 samsung that if it should work and I do not 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.680
 is basically working that is the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.050
 problem in the other night you do not 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.670
 I could enter otherwise simply 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.520
 I did not enter 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.220
 I saved you from committing this kind of 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.530
 error that as you can see damages the sensor 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.890
 has damaged the sensor that realizes 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.200
 when he left, he no longer serves us 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.180
 ok there is a sensor that there would be something here I 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.190
 I swear I promise you if you see 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.780
 another review of note 5 you are going to 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.430
 watch 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.830
 I could not show you I've done it 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.930
 reviewed but that's the problem in another 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.090
 device man I said does not happen I think 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.680
 which is a fault as always going to create 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.420
 news why is that extend yes 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.060
 because I wanted to make the video 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.430
 explaining what the know 25 of me will take 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.610
 just damaged in the same video yo ni 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.109
 I thought about going in because it's like 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.570
 iphone when folded I do not double the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.859
 I do not like mine I see it reported and 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.590
 ready but I do not like to hurt the 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.550
 devices and this one is not 5 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.860
 authentically damaged because the function 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.220
 main guy is the main function 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.630
 of the 'notes is the s &amp; p nor if the s &amp; p does not 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.370
 it's going to work the way it is 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.460
 course to work it follows you 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.919
 working ok I can use it but not 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.880
 it does not detect me when I take it out and that 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.460
 it was a function of more 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.400
 good as you can see it's still working 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.790
 but the sensor detect the areas in 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.890
 rap seems that up to here is the problem 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.990
 tell me what you think of that failure 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.460
 a lot I know they're going to say Martians but 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.230
 Of course nobody is between the well if 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.820
 there are going to be people who are going to commit 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.280
 that error and go in a little bit to rain 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.160
 sorry because they are identical as they can 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.520
 see the s &amp; p is very similar to the two 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.870
 easy sides to make that mistake and more than 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 samsung tells you inside you can enter from 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.740
 both sides like both sides and it's not going 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.080
 to have problems you start to 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.850
 do not worry and that's when this guy 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 of error your facts above tell me here 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.249
 down that you think of this 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.069
 little mistake 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.489
 The design error marchand font closes 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.489
 section 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.900
 and they wonder why my jaima not 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.150
 is there will be more row is not there 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.490
 next video I'll explain what 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.910
 it happened Martian hong again leaving 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.910
 section
