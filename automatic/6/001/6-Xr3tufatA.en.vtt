tutorial that I made ok here we go first

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.849 
tutorial that I made ok here we go first
here's<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.570> looks<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:18.869> finished<00:00:19.590> in

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
here's what it looks like finished in

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.060 
here's what it looks like finished in
the<00:00:20.100> down<00:00:20.279> position<00:00:21.619> here's<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> need

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the down position here's what you need

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.730 
the down position here's what you need
you<00:00:23.910> need<00:00:24.060> half<00:00:24.330> inch<00:00:24.539> PVC<00:00:24.720> pipe<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.439> more<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you need half inch PVC pipe the more the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
you need half inch PVC pipe the more the
better<00:00:26.180> two<00:00:27.859> half-inch<00:00:28.859> caps<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:30.210> tease<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
better two half-inch caps to tease and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.229 
better two half-inch caps to tease and
here's<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> tricky<00:00:32.730> part<00:00:32.969> 1<00:00:33.899> T<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.579> ends

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
here's the tricky part 1 T all the ends

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.920 
here's the tricky part 1 T all the ends
need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.630> open<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.500> slip<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> cult

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
need to be open just slip into the cult

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.020 
need to be open just slip into the cult
slit<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> other<00:00:40.800> T<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> be

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
slit and the other T these need to be

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.479 
slit and the other T these need to be
open<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> top<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.739> need<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.980> threaded

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
open in the top will need to be threaded

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.799 
open in the top will need to be threaded
so<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.690> slit<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.100> slip<00:00:47.370> 13<00:00:47.809> ok

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so one slit all and one to slip 13 ok

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
so one slit all and one to slip 13 ok
and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:51.260> similar<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> cover<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> half

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and then similar you cover here a half

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
and then similar you cover here a half
inch<00:00:53.730> coupling<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.199> male<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.800> female

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
inch coupling and a male to female

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
inch coupling and a male to female
adapter<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.420> female<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.109> male<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
adapter so it's female to male and the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
adapter so it's female to male and the
male<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> threaded<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.449> screws<00:01:00.660> into

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
male is threaded and it just screws into

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:11.570 
male is threaded and it just screws into
here<00:01:02.539> ok<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> years<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.420> years<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> help<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
here ok and years and years and help you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
here ok and years and years and help you
need<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:11.880> elbow<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.630> plug<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.229> goes<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> end

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
need an elbow and a plug it goes the end

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
need an elbow and a plug it goes the end
and<00:01:13.979> here's<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.119> mods<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> easily

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and here's two mods that you can easily

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.080 
and here's two mods that you can easily
make<00:01:16.439> Tyrion<00:01:18.110> here's<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> upright<00:01:19.650> position

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
make Tyrion here's the upright position

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.370 
make Tyrion here's the upright position
here's<00:01:21.090> two<00:01:21.330> blocks<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.780> easily<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here's two blocks you can easily make to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
here's two blocks you can easily make to
it<00:01:22.470> instead<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.280> getting<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:24.119> elbow<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it instead of getting an elbow and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260 
it instead of getting an elbow and
another<00:01:25.080> plug<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:26.280> take<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> get

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
another plug just take that off and get

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
another plug just take that off and get
a<00:01:27.299> third<00:01:27.630> cap<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> easier<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
a third cap and now make it easier and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
a third cap and now make it easier and
instead<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> worrying<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> threads

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
instead of worrying about the threads

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240 
instead of worrying about the threads
are<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> regular<00:01:34.619> elbow<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
are not just get a regular elbow and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670 
are not just get a regular elbow and
take<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> PVC<00:01:35.640> pipe<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> pushing<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> top<00:01:36.780> but

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
take a PVC pipe and pushing the top but

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
take a PVC pipe and pushing the top but
i<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.189> threaded<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.759> i<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
i like it threaded so i can take it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.380 
i like it threaded so i can take it
apart<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.869> glue<00:01:40.770> everything<00:01:41.100> except<00:01:42.000> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
apart and glue everything except this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.590 
apart and glue everything except this
part<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.820> because<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.329> makes<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
part right here because that makes you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
part right here because that makes you
where<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.930> move<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
where you can move it up and down to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.749 
where you can move it up and down to
take<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> apart<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.810> storage<00:01:49.229> order<00:01:49.759> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
take it apart or for storage order so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.260 
take it apart or for storage order so
all<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.619> cut<00:01:52.860> cut<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> piece<00:01:53.939> about

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
all you do is you cut cut a piece about

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
all you do is you cut cut a piece about
a<00:01:54.420> foot<00:01:54.689> long<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:56.100> weeks<00:01:56.130> left
