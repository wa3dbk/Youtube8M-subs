00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.580
 hi everybody long grueling winter 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.349
 behind and let's be honest to everyone usually 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.180
 time of year you are gas miserable 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.599

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.029
 impression that you just 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 come back from those personal holidays let's start 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 makeup primer application on a clean self 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 an important advance on the face is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 plot like school nose and top 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 lip contour this will help us in the future 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.260
 sizo healthy glow which will 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.260
 look and see 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 and after that you can start making 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 2. Do I give a tablet to use? 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.720
 blooming trees on something on 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.460
 face and neck 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.200
 of course there is a minus i 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.920
 wrote costs and speed 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.930
 alexina and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 but it is perfect for 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.400
 make the effect of skin pores and also with such 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.170
 way should carefully because 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.119
 would not miss quite often in the face and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.010
 forget about hairline and eyebrow growth 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.840
 heiress these can be in advance now there 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.220
 line down so that they do not interfere 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.570
 Ksenia like I did 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.369
 for areas requiring additional 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 all 6 not lightening using corrector 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.679
 and for inflammation like me in some kind 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.969
 some strange place got out 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.189
 incomprehensible inflammation 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.259
 best to use cream at the end and 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.450
 now that we have the perfect base 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.560
 You can do the rendering of shadows in 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.319
 I chose as the main color 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.789
 Honda kids project Urban Wild which 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.679
 I apply all moving eyelids with 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.979
 lovely brush which is a kit with 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.979
 a palette 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 further using the same brush in the outer 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.410
 corner of the eye put a shadow called 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.880
 smog and hooray with another clean brush 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.280
 shade the day it's a smooth transition 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.540
 due to the fact that the boot chimeric shadows 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 very quick and easy to quench 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.030
 when the transition to the eyelids is perfectly smooth and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.460
 go to feather the outer border 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.590
 I type on our clean brush the same smog 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.850
 and shaded the century delivery and on 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.850
 Moving part of the century century 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.480
 and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.459
 and in order to make the transition 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.800
 smooth everything as smoothly as possible 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.610
 outer border using matte shadows 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.610
 tele stalker 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.500
 shadows are also an ideal remedy for 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.650
 creating gentle arrows so we 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.880
 We use them as a regular liner 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.890
 we put as close as possible to the growth line 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 lashes on the upper and lower eyelids and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.420
 connect the outer corner of the eye 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.170
 and after itself we apply mascara of it 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.460
 Onions ideally will come volume mascara but you 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.670
 can use any which 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.670
 fits 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.930
 no particular focus on the eyebrows 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.070
 especially i need it so just 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.000
 combing them can not tutor 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.310
 also like to add some white 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 pencil on the inner lower eyelid it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.180
 helps to make eyes brighter 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 snowy and in order to give our 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.140
 tanned favor because we need two 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.700

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.160

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.780
 in addition to the usual following 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.540
