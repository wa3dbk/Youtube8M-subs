00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
actually we have built breathability

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.139 
actually we have built breathability
built<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> fabric<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.340> those<00:00:32.790> people

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
built into the fabric so those people

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.280 
built into the fabric so those people
that<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.329> complained<00:00:33.630> about<00:00:33.750> getting<00:00:34.170> too

thing<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:19.229> careful<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thing you do want to be careful of is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
thing you do want to be careful of is
compasses<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.119> still<00:01:21.360> using<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
compasses if you're still using a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
compasses if you're still using a
compass<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.610> got<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> keep<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.119> least<00:01:24.210> 24

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
compass you got to keep at least 24

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
compass you got to keep at least 24
inches<00:01:24.780> away<00:01:25.220> from<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> magnet<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
inches away from the magnet so in this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
inches away from the magnet so in this
particular<00:01:27.360> jacket<00:01:27.930> you'll<00:01:28.619> probably<00:01:28.740> don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
particular jacket you'll probably don't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
particular jacket you'll probably don't
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.310> compass<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> other

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
want to use a compass we do have other

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
want to use a compass we do have other
models<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> snaps<00:01:31.560> instead<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
models that have snaps instead of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.490 
models that have snaps instead of
magnets<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.150> that's<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.540> thing<00:01:33.570> by<00:01:34.290> one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
magnets so if that's your thing by one

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.310 
magnets so if that's your thing by one
