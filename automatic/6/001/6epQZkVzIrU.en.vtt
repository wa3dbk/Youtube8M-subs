 the 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.769
 lille 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260

 with the result and 1750 euros to spend 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.610
 so we are going to try to put the content at 20 11 to 21 hours to make this much easier 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 too much possible to slow down 55 cents 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 a goal 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.440

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.399
