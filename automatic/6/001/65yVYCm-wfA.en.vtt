00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
familiar with the zombie Colossus so I'm

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
familiar with the zombie Colossus so I'm
not<00:01:02.129> sure<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.940> supposed<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> steel

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
not sure it's supposed to be a steel

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.060 
not sure it's supposed to be a steel
Colossus<00:01:06.439> because<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> pictures<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Colossus because from the pictures that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.390 
Colossus because from the pictures that
I've<00:01:08.280> seen<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.670> looks<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.570> just

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
I've seen it looks like it's it's just

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
I've seen it looks like it's it's just
him<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.520> his<00:01:11.640> flesh<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> zombie<00:01:13.400> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
him in his flesh as a zombie but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
him in his flesh as a zombie but
nonetheless<00:01:14.580> still<00:01:15.450> looks<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> cool

there's blood on his belt you can't see
the<00:02:23.180> X<00:02:23.630> anymore<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:25.520> like<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.820> fade<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> away

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the X anymore just like to fade it away

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.960 
the X anymore just like to fade it away
from<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.540> blood<00:02:28.060> I'm<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:30.340> huge<00:02:31.340> hole<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.640> his

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
