00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
look at that a crazy little contraption

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.460 
look at that a crazy little contraption
there<00:00:56.360> he's<00:00:56.600> actually<00:00:56.780> designed<00:00:57.199> for<00:00:57.350> ice

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
there he's actually designed for ice

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.350 
there he's actually designed for ice
fishing<00:00:57.860> obviously<00:00:58.699> we're<00:00:58.790> not<00:00:58.850> ice<00:00:59.030> fishing

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
fishing obviously we're not ice fishing

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.119 
fishing obviously we're not ice fishing
today<00:00:59.600> but<00:00:59.900> the<00:00:59.989> best-loved<00:01:00.619> these<00:01:00.860> things

today but the best-loved these things

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.500 
today but the best-loved these things
and<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.729> reason<00:01:01.760> they<00:01:02.059> use<00:01:02.150> in<00:01:02.269> for<00:01:02.420> ice

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
and the reason they use in for ice

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.030 
and the reason they use in for ice
fishing<00:01:02.900> because<00:01:03.439> when<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.650> go<00:01:03.769> into<00:01:03.920> your

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
fishing because when you go into your

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.700 
fishing because when you go into your
big<00:01:04.220> snowpack<00:01:05.180> like<00:01:05.449> they<00:01:06.080> go<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.320> cut<00:01:06.439> a<00:01:06.470> hole

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
big snowpack like they go and cut a hole

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.530 
big snowpack like they go and cut a hole
and<00:01:06.979> they<00:01:07.040> drop<00:01:07.250> these<00:01:07.430> things<00:01:07.490> down<00:01:07.939> with<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
and they drop these things down with the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.359 
and they drop these things down with the
fins<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:08.990> different<00:01:09.320> angles<00:01:09.409> on<00:01:09.650> them<00:01:09.799> they

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
fins and different angles on them they

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.620 
fins and different angles on them they
swerve<00:01:10.670> all<00:01:10.850> over<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.090> place<00:01:11.330> did<00:01:11.509> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
swerve all over the place did the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.149 
swerve all over the place did the
littlest<00:01:12.049> amount<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.380> movement<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.860> slight

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
littlest amount of movement so slight

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.950

swivel<00:01:15.380> over<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.650> place<00:01:15.860> if<00:01:16.520> when<00:01:16.730> we've<00:01:16.850> got

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
swivel over the place if when we've got

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.120 
swivel over the place if when we've got
fish<00:01:17.180> like<00:01:17.360> they<00:01:17.510> are<00:01:17.630> today<00:01:17.750> with<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.320> not<00:01:18.980> as

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
fish like they are today with it not as

fish like they are today with it not as
active<00:01:19.280> as<00:01:19.520> usual<00:01:19.910> they<00:01:20.060> are<00:01:20.180> shut<00:01:20.810> down<00:01:20.840> we're

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
active as usual they are shut down we're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.990 
active as usual they are shut down we're
seeing<00:01:21.440> them<00:01:21.650> here<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:21.980> they're<00:01:22.190> dropping

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
seeing them here and they're dropping

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.640 
seeing them here and they're dropping
something<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.900> head<00:01:24.110> really

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
something like that the head really

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.440 
something like that the head really
stirs<00:01:24.920> them<00:01:25.160> up<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:25.790> basically<00:01:26.150> because

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
stirs them up and it's basically because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.360 
stirs them up and it's basically because
it's<00:01:26.660> crazy<00:01:26.930> swirling<00:01:27.470> action<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.130> they're

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
it's crazy swirling action and they're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.350 
it's crazy swirling action and they're
so<00:01:28.640> simple<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.120> use

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
so simple to use

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.660 
so simple to use
they're<00:01:30.350> pretty<00:01:30.590> dangerous<00:01:30.980> so<00:01:31.100> always<00:01:31.460> keep

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
they're pretty dangerous so always keep

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.190 
they're pretty dangerous so always keep
an<00:01:31.790> eye<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:32.000> those<00:01:32.120> when<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.480> netting<00:01:33.110> your

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200
