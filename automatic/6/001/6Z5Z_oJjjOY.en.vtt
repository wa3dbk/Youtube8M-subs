00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430

magazines<00:00:40.790> for<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.030> while<00:00:41.210> but<00:00:41.780> there's<00:00:41.989> always

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
magazines for a while but there's always

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
been reliability issues with them this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.829 
been reliability issues with them this
one<00:00:46.250> I've<00:00:46.519> read<00:00:46.909> very<00:00:47.150> good<00:00:47.299> reviews<00:00:47.600> about

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
one I've read very good reviews about

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.079 
one I've read very good reviews about
and<00:00:48.080> I<00:00:48.799> imagine<00:00:49.280> it's<00:00:49.430> because<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.670> spring<00:00:49.970> is

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
and I imagine it's because the spring is

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.299 
and I imagine it's because the spring is
really<00:00:50.210> strong<00:00:50.600> because<00:00:50.750> man<00:00:51.710> my<00:00:51.860> finger<00:00:52.190> is

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
really strong because man my finger is

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.430 
really strong because man my finger is
raw<00:00:52.580> after<00:00:52.940> filling<00:00:53.269> this<00:00:53.390> up<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.720> was<00:00:53.839> hard<00:00:54.260> to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
raw after filling this up it was hard to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.530 
raw after filling this up it was hard to
get<00:00:54.680> 30<00:00:54.890> rounds<00:00:55.250> into<00:00:55.369> this<00:00:55.549> and<00:00:55.790> hopefully

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
get 30 rounds into this and hopefully

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.299 
get 30 rounds into this and hopefully
after<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.960> break<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.290> in<00:00:57.379> for<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.589> while<00:00:57.739> it'll

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
after you break it in for a while it'll

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.369 
after you break it in for a while it'll
run<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> lot<00:00:58.699> better<00:00:58.909> or<00:00:59.420> it'll<00:00:59.629> it'll<00:01:00.080> feel<00:01:00.350> a

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
run a lot better or it'll it'll feel a

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.380 
run a lot better or it'll it'll feel a
lot<00:01:00.530> better<00:01:00.650> in<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:00.949> magazine<00:01:01.159> but<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:02.239> was
