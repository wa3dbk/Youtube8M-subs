character<00:02:10.950> had<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> tail<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.640> after

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
character had a tail and so after

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
character had a tail and so after
it's<00:02:12.849> legs<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:15.180> did<00:02:16.180> cut<00:02:16.540> off<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.470> spines

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's legs I did cut off the back spines

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.570 
it's legs I did cut off the back spines
on<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:19.060> upper<00:02:19.420> body<00:02:19.660> like<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.290> usually<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.890> but

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
on the upper body like I usually do but

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.430 
on the upper body like I usually do but
this<00:02:22.090> time<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.330> left<00:02:22.599> about<00:02:22.750> half<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.290> them

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
this time I left about half of them

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.780 
this time I left about half of them
there<00:02:23.739> for<00:02:24.099> reasons<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.580> will<00:02:24.700> become

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
there for reasons which will become

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.540 
there for reasons which will become
apparent<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.810> moment<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.319> then<00:02:27.310> I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
apparent in just a moment and then I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.479 
apparent in just a moment and then I
sculpted<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.750> arm<00:02:29.170> cannon<00:02:29.890> looking<00:02:30.190> things

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
sculpted the arm cannon looking things

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.510 
sculpted the arm cannon looking things
in<00:02:30.850> two<00:02:31.180> bits<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.800> internal

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
in two bits first is this internal

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.360 
in two bits first is this internal
barrel<00:02:34.510> thing<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.110> you're<00:02:35.319> seeing<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.920> then

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
barrel thing that you're seeing and then

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.150 
barrel thing that you're seeing and then
once<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.790> had<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.000> shape<00:02:37.569> defined<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:38.890> put

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
once I had that shape defined I then put

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.860 
once I had that shape defined I then put
the<00:02:39.280> other<00:02:39.550> layer<00:02:39.819> out<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.300> top<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.750> it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the other layer out on top of it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050 
the other layer out on top of it
creating<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.769> appearance<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.940> know

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
creating the appearance of you know

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.590 
creating the appearance of you know
sleeves<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.290> turn<00:02:44.650> into<00:02:44.980> big<00:02:45.340> giant<00:02:46.060> Megaman

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
sleeves that turn into big giant Megaman

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.180 
sleeves that turn into big giant Megaman
sized<00:02:46.980> gun<00:02:47.980> barrel<00:02:48.400> arms<00:02:48.989> okay<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.130> once<00:02:51.130> that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
sized gun barrel arms okay so once that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.699 
sized gun barrel arms okay so once that
was<00:02:51.400> done<00:02:51.640> up<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.690> point<00:02:52.959> literal<00:02:53.560> kind

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
was done up to this point literal kind

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650 
was done up to this point literal kind
of<00:02:53.860> looks<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.340> yeah<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> painted<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.569> off

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
of looks like this yeah I painted it off

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.199 
of looks like this yeah I painted it off
camera<00:02:56.080> all<00:02:56.709> right<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.190> here's<00:02:57.489> why<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> left

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
camera all right and here's why I left

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.960 
camera all right and here's why I left
half<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.959> Sonic<00:02:59.319> spines<00:02:59.620> there<00:02:59.920> they're<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
half of Sonic spines there they're the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.330 
half of Sonic spines there they're the
Rockets<00:03:01.720> that'll<00:03:01.989> make<00:03:02.230> Lea<00:03:02.500> little<00:03:02.920> jetpack

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
Rockets that'll make Lea little jetpack

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.120 
Rockets that'll make Lea little jetpack
I<00:03:03.670> already<00:03:04.480> kind<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.230> painted<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.769> pointy

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
I already kind of painted the pointy

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.729 
I already kind of painted the pointy
part<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:07.299> let's<00:03:07.569> attach<00:03:07.900> them<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.290> his<00:03:08.470> back

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
part so let's attach them to his back

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.699 
part so let's attach them to his back
and<00:03:09.040> they<00:03:09.580> look<00:03:10.299> like<00:03:10.450> this<00:03:10.709> another

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
and they look like this another

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.680 
and they look like this another
spectacular<00:03:12.010> little<00:03:12.549> backpack<00:03:12.970> all<00:03:13.569> right

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
spectacular little backpack all right

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.380 
spectacular little backpack all right
let's<00:03:13.840> get<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> nice<00:03:14.140> 360<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.069> figure<00:03:15.390> all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
let's get a nice 360 of this figure all

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.699 
let's get a nice 360 of this figure all
right<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.750> was<00:03:16.900> actually<00:03:17.230> kind<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.500> difficult

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
right it was actually kind of difficult

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.310 
right it was actually kind of difficult
to<00:03:18.250> find<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:19.000> way<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> mount<00:03:19.450> those<00:03:19.750> jetpacks

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
to find a way to mount those jetpacks

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.020 
to find a way to mount those jetpacks
because<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.370> know<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.519> couldn't<00:03:21.790> make<00:03:21.880> them

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
because you know I couldn't make them

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.090 
because you know I couldn't make them
too<00:03:22.209> small<00:03:22.239> couldn't<00:03:23.079> make<00:03:23.170> them<00:03:23.290> too<00:03:23.470> big<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
too small couldn't make them too big and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.580 
too small couldn't make them too big and
there<00:03:24.549> actually<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> lot<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.900> space<00:03:26.290> on

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
there actually is not a lot of space on

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.410 
there actually is not a lot of space on
the<00:03:26.709> back<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.160> sonic<00:03:27.519> figure<00:03:27.790> at<00:03:27.970> all

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the back of a sonic figure at all

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.500 
the back of a sonic figure at all
between<00:03:29.230> how<00:03:29.709> physically<00:03:30.579> tiny<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.329> back

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
between how physically tiny the back

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.500 
between how physically tiny the back
actually<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.549> mention<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.180> fact<00:03:34.329> that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
actually is not to mention the fact that

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.930 
actually is not to mention the fact that
the<00:03:34.870> head<00:03:35.410> spines<00:03:35.859> kind<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.340> come<00:03:36.519> down<00:03:36.730> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
the head spines kind of come down and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.449 
the head spines kind of come down and
cover<00:03:37.150> most<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.720> anyway

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
cover most of it anyway

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.120 
cover most of it anyway
but<00:03:39.459> completed<00:03:40.239> he<00:03:40.690> came<00:03:41.109> out<00:03:41.260> like<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.680> and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
but completed he came out like this and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.460 
but completed he came out like this and
it's<00:03:42.640> actually<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> pretty<00:03:43.570> nice<00:03:43.870> figure<00:03:44.290> it's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
it's actually a pretty nice figure it's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.729 
it's actually a pretty nice figure it's
very<00:03:44.739> brightly<00:03:45.280> colored<00:03:45.850> he<00:03:46.540> has<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.230> lot<00:03:47.650> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
very brightly colored he has a lot of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.460 
very brightly colored he has a lot of
cool<00:03:48.040> features<00:03:48.400> those<00:03:49.180> cannons<00:03:50.109> actually

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
cool features those cannons actually

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.250 
cool features those cannons actually
looked<00:03:50.650> kind<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.010> effective<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.019> I'm<00:03:53.019> not

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
looked kind of effective and I'm not

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.380 
looked kind of effective and I'm not
really<00:03:53.440> sure<00:03:53.560> if<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:54.010> came<00:03:54.250> across<00:03:54.579> but<00:03:55.209> he

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
really sure if it came across but he

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.300 
really sure if it came across but he
does<00:03:55.660> have<00:03:55.840> little<00:03:56.230> Rockets<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.829> his<00:03:56.980> feet

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
does have little Rockets on his feet

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.460 
does have little Rockets on his feet
which<00:03:57.609> double<00:03:58.000> his<00:03:58.090> heel<00:03:58.450> spurs<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.140> he<00:03:59.260> has<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
which double his heel spurs so he has a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.670 
which double his heel spurs so he has a
fairly<00:04:00.220> stable<00:04:00.400> stance<00:04:00.730> alright<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.380> is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
fairly stable stance alright so that is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.440 
fairly stable stance alright so that is
Super<00:04:03.310> Junior<00:04:03.340> oh<00:04:05.069> yeah<00:04:06.069> hopefully<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:07.180> will

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
Super Junior oh yeah hopefully I will

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.930 
Super Junior oh yeah hopefully I will
have<00:04:07.510> another<00:04:08.109> custom<00:04:08.829> in<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.519> relatively
