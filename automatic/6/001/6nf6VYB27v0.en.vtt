00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.620
 today we are going to talk about the roses that 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.840
 are for me the queens the kings of the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.459
 plants in the garden the first thing that 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.469
 we should know is where to place a 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.930
 rosal el rosal is a plant that 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.830
 needs sun therefore we must of 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.539
 locate it in a place that gives the sun to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 quite also be in the morning by 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.429
 the afternoon or even all day here 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.710
 we have several types of roses here 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.050
 are the rosebush standing under us 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.360
 we call it normal rose in yellow 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.070
 lilac and white we have it here 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960
 here we have also one of the salts 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.420
 big flower flower climbers 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 quite fat and here we will have 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.080
 examples of small flower rose 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.690
 also climber this is called mini 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.540
 berry and me is that to my left 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.460
 we have the rose bushes that you 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.610
 we call that they have a trunk and up 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.200
 where they already have the rose and where where 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.540
 is the most open most good plant is 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.520
 very important that is that the roses 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.710
 we fertilize them well is a plant that 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.810
 need at least twice a year 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.580
 esther colarla or cast a model 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.060
 Man in autumn and spring 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.160
 we must do it and in addition to those two 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.830
 times a year that we do them too 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.350
 we must pour a liquid fertilizer or 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.850
 well granulated and each product of each 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.000
 which in the pot that should do it be 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.560
 a liquid fertilizer every 15 days in 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.180
 spring and once a month in winter 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.480
 either grams of fertilizer voided from that already 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.610
 it will depend on how it is released and 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.230
 you should also know that the roses 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.510
 you have to prune them when you arrive a month 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.729
 of late December or early 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.370
 january here in almeria that does quite 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.340
 heat within that time for pruning 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.300
 important that we find from the trunk and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 from the trunk has a branch in 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 those branches have buds that are a 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.580
 hairline that counts the pink from 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.460
 the third branch where we must 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.160
 cut it and strong pruning is done in that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.860
 epoch but it is true that the rest 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.040
 of the year when I eat here for example that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 already has a last flower as we take and 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.470
 we cut this rose since it's over 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200
 we would cut it here over the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.120
 leaf we cut the rose and so we go 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.310
 rejuvenating the rose every time 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.980
 we cut a pink it rejuvenates more 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 It is also very important when it comes to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.100
 take care of the plants as we have already 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.200
 commented on other occasions and how 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.370
 we will comment 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.160
 we wish the rose a fungicide 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 because it is a plant that leaves a lot 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.730
 the powdery mildew that is also called ash 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.590
 which is like a white layer 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.440
 and above the sheet for that we should 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 of fumigating them in preventive mode a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.640
 once a month or every 15 days depends on the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 we can also throw it against the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.780
 red spider that is also very common in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.819
 them or even with an aphids a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.190
 insecticide and acaricide also every 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.750
 15-20 days a little bit and so we will have 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.360
 the well-protected roses of the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.750
 diseases and pests there 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.580
 when the heat arrives 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.100
 Well, I've already explained a bit how 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.540
 these plants work and they 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.210
 you are seeing the pretty ones that are 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.610
 with its flowers so you know if 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.590
 you have places in the garden or in the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.130
 terrace put a rose that will give you 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.130
 thank you
