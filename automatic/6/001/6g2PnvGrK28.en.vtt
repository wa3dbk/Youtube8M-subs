00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
kept hounding the retail for the rest of
their<00:01:52.470> check<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.340> retail<00:01:53.790> eventually<00:01:54.540> went

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
their check the retail eventually went

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
their check the retail eventually went
under<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.680> never<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.600> money

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
under so never going to see the money

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
under so never going to see the money
for<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.079> product<00:01:58.469> ever<00:01:58.860> again<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
for that product ever again and this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.380 
for that product ever again and this
happens<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.259> too<00:02:01.320> often<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.180> first

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
happens all too often I think the first

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.929 
happens all too often I think the first
season<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.110> shipping<00:02:04.759> there<00:02:05.759> was

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
season that I was shipping there was

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.680 
season that I was shipping there was
several<00:02:06.689> several<00:02:07.759> retail<00:02:08.759> locations<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
several several retail locations that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.350 
several several retail locations that
order<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.470> factor<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:12.180> my

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
order so I factor that in to my

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790 
order so I factor that in to my
production<00:02:12.959> numbers

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
production numbers

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.310 
production numbers
