00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 I went back and took me on video day. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.040
 I was not able to record much 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 I would run but I came back with the cool tip 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 For you, there are a lot of people, we could not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 of the ones I had done in the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:29.640
 You have the video there. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 underneath so many people asking and there not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.700
 I have to show you how it was 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.489
 I did as I took the mold 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.410
 so it's cool this tip is because it gives 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 for you to make a mold several things 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.980
 wanting template stays looking I do not think 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 do not you think 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.920
 then this tip on how you even 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.899
 take the mold with you 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 so come on 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.010
 how do i do first, i'll get one 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.460
 the size of the lid is glass and then I 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 Here I Come 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.509
 It's a mistake growing up until I think 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 is the size of the cap placed 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.799
 on top of the taste more or less 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:29.420
 maybe more or less how are you going to stay 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:34.280
 so itamar borders is what I say 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.140
 It's a pencil pen 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.820
 so come on, I've got a sheet of 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 sulfite can be that vegetable leaf 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.119
 for who is starting now is better 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 because it will be very transparent 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 You'll see all the details. 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.670
 I'll do it, I'll just scan it, I'll use it. 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.869
 this part here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.149
 You have to imagine that part here 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.090
 trace need not take such that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.239
 all because you're going to lining the lid 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 Who saw the video, who did not see it? 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.710
 see that you will understand that I am 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:26.600
 talking then take the mold that 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:26.600
 Yes the taverna and ska, yes, I do. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.940
 can scratch yes or make dot 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.870
 If you do not want to lose, you do not want to. 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.620
 do all the little face there you do 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 then cut out the part that will use 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.560
 giving to understand 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 I think that's where I took it, I 'll go 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.320
 cut cut this part here from 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.960
 muzzle all separate and cut ear 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.800
 also he does not need us to do it 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.660
 with ink but if you want you can also 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.600
 Also we get pen when 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.120
 went to see her right 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.490
 so this is very simple 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.370
 and then you do you do it with all 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.010
 the bichinhas these here were the bichinhos 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 I used it there, I did it. 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.940
 according to the custom god 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.090
 these custom bugs and then I used them 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.810
 them to do the little pot of fabinho to 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.060
 everything looks the same 5 and it looks pretty cute 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.430
