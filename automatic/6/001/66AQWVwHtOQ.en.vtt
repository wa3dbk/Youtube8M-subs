with<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.489> engine<00:03:27.930> Subaru<00:03:28.930> Beal<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.440> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
with this engine Subaru Beal and I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.990 
with this engine Subaru Beal and I
believe<00:03:29.889> was<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.340> them<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.489> i<00:03:30.670> believe

they<00:03:31.120> also<00:03:31.299> use<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.799> construct<00:03:33.280> 2<00:03:33.430> engine<00:03:33.730> i

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
they also use the construct 2 engine i

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.599 
they also use the construct 2 engine i
believe<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.420> LIA<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.139> well<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.489> that's

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609
