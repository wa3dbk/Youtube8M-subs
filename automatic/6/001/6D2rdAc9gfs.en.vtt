weight<00:00:18.330> loss<00:00:18.770> programs<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.220> January<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.300> get

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
weight loss programs in January to get

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.950 
weight loss programs in January to get
fit<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> rest<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> year<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.960> that's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
fit for the rest of the year and that's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
fit for the rest of the year and that's
great<00:00:25.200> but<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.250> approach<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.610> weight<00:00:27.030> loss<00:00:27.270> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
great but my approach to weight loss and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
great but my approach to weight loss and
fitness<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.440> just<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.980> bit<00:00:29.130> different<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
fitness is just a little bit different I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
fitness is just a little bit different I
really<00:00:30.210> believe<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.690> case<00:00:31.440> in<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.920> case

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
really believe in this case in that case

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.660 
really believe in this case in that case
of<00:00:32.369> weight<00:00:32.550> loss<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.559> hair<00:00:35.129> does<00:00:35.640> not

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
of weight loss that the hair does not

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
of weight loss that the hair does not
necessarily<00:00:36.030> win<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> race<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.379> turtle

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
necessarily win the race that the turtle

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.630 
necessarily win the race that the turtle
definitely<00:00:38.190> wins<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.329> race<00:00:40.489> taking<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
definitely wins the race taking all the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.350 
definitely wins the race taking all the
weight<00:00:41.970> slowly<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.340> systematically<00:00:44.340> over<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
weight slowly and systematically over a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
weight slowly and systematically over a
long<00:00:45.780> period<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.970> always<00:00:47.970> it's<00:00:48.420> better<00:00:48.920> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
long period of time always it's better I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
long period of time always it's better I
have<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.940> quickly<00:00:51.300> lost<00:00:51.989> 40<00:00:52.680> pounds<00:00:52.710> and

effort so today I'm going to give you
some<00:01:04.829> tips<00:01:05.009> on<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> found<00:01:05.789> that<00:01:06.060> really

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
some tips on what I found that really

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
some tips on what I found that really
really<00:01:06.570> works<00:01:06.899> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:09.170> dropping<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
really works in the way of dropping and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.420 
really works in the way of dropping and
shedding<00:01:10.920> pounds<00:01:12.290> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> long<00:01:13.619> haul<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
shedding pounds for the long haul so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.680 
shedding pounds for the long haul so
they<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.760> creep<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.510> on<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.190> one<00:01:17.690> tip

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
they don't creep back up on you one tip

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.020 
they don't creep back up on you one tip
that<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.260> have<00:01:19.409> found<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.190> continuing<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that I have found is not continuing to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
that I have found is not continuing to
wear<00:01:21.240> clothes<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> no<00:01:22.409> longer<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.920> when

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

will pick the weight right back up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
will pick the weight right back up
because<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:29.970> room<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> grow<00:01:30.689> in

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
always a good idea especially when

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
always a good idea especially when
they're<00:01:51.540> easily<00:01:51.720> obtainable<00:01:52.290> pack<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:52.920> away

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
they're easily obtainable pack them away

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
they're easily obtainable pack them away
and<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.299> label<00:01:54.630> them<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.380> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and about to label them by the side so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.080 
and about to label them by the side so
that<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.400> back<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> box

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that if you have to go back to the box

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.440 
that if you have to go back to the box
you<00:01:57.600> remember<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:58.560> size<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.009> were<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.610> you

want to get back to that side another

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.990 
want to get back to that side another
step<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.810> found<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.829> pre<00:02:05.310> planning<00:02:05.610> my
