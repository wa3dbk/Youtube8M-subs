00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there were a couple things which were

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
there were a couple things which were
pretty<00:02:00.390> grave<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:01.050> when<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
pretty grave actually when I want to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
pretty grave actually when I want to
think<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> after<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> our

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
think about it and after that our

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
think about it and after that our
instructors<00:02:04.740> they've<00:02:05.369> showed<00:02:05.670> them<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.659> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
instructors they've showed them what is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.710 
instructors they've showed them what is
the<00:02:06.900> defensive<00:02:07.350> driving<00:02:07.560> how<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> drive<00:02:08.720> he

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the defensive driving how to drive he

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
the defensive driving how to drive he
now<00:02:10.319> got<00:02:10.560> behind<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> wheel

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
now got behind the wheel

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.010 
now got behind the wheel
he's<00:02:11.640> are<00:02:11.790> driving<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.570> how<00:02:12.959> he

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
he's are driving I have to see how he

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.780 
he's are driving I have to see how he
was<00:02:13.260> doing<00:02:13.500> things<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.700> the

was doing things and one of the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.970 
was doing things and one of the
techniques<00:02:15.120> he<00:02:15.300> uses<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.740> talk

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
about everything that's happening on the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.730 
about everything that's happening on the
road<00:02:18.510> ahead<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.750> him<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> pickup<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
road ahead of him and the pickup is

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.680 
road ahead of him and the pickup is
coming<00:02:20.010> behind<00:02:20.190> me<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:21.270> was<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.540> good

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
coming behind me it was really good

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420 
coming behind me it was really good
because<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.930> gave<00:02:21.989> me<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.200> chance<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.650> well<00:02:23.220> for

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
because it gave me a chance to well for

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.340 
because it gave me a chance to well for
one<00:02:23.580> watching<00:02:24.030> him<00:02:24.150> drive<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.660> seeing<00:02:25.140> how<00:02:25.290> he

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
one watching him drive and seeing how he

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
one watching him drive and seeing how he
was<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.130> smooth<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.610> his<00:02:26.730> lane<00:02:26.910> changes<00:02:27.420> for

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
was very smooth in his lane changes for

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310 
was very smooth in his lane changes for
instance<00:02:28.489> how<00:02:29.510> aware<00:02:30.510> he<00:02:30.630> was<00:02:30.660> was<00:02:30.989> going<00:02:31.200> on

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
instance how aware he was was going on

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.840 
instance how aware he was was going on
the<00:02:31.410> road<00:02:31.620> everything<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.489> showed<00:02:32.640> me<00:02:32.820> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the road everything you showed me I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
the road everything you showed me I
thought<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.510> beneficial<00:02:33.959> actually

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
thought was really beneficial actually

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.740 
thought was really beneficial actually
afterwards<00:02:35.070> dibelius<00:02:35.970> will<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.420> an<00:02:36.540> electric

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
afterwards dibelius will be an electric

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.509 
afterwards dibelius will be an electric
once<00:02:37.080> again<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> sit<00:02:38.340> behind

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
once again they would have to sit behind

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.130 
once again they would have to sit behind
the<00:02:38.760> steering<00:02:38.820> wheel<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:39.989> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the steering wheel and they have to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.530 
the steering wheel and they have to
drive<00:02:40.380> where<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> trainer<00:02:41.580> will<00:02:41.910> only<00:02:42.120> coach

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
drive where the trainer will only coach

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.970 
drive where the trainer will only coach
them<00:02:42.780> there<00:02:42.959> were<00:02:43.050> only<00:02:43.200> probably<00:02:43.560> coaching

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
them there were only probably coaching

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.550 
them there were only probably coaching
to<00:02:44.100> them<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> end<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:46.170> me<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to them and in the end it was for me to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.949 
to them and in the end it was for me to
drive<00:02:46.739> again<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.670> was<00:02:47.880> kind<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.150> well<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
drive again and this was kind of well I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
drive again and this was kind of well I
thought<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.350> was<00:02:49.440> my<00:02:49.590> final<00:02:49.920> evaluation

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
thought it was my final evaluation

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.470 
thought it was my final evaluation
although<00:02:50.700> maybe<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.060> wouldn't<00:02:51.269> put<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
although maybe they wouldn't put it that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.890 
although maybe they wouldn't put it that
way

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
way

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
way
so<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> certainly<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.040> I'd<00:02:53.160> weren't<00:02:53.519> what

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
so to certainly see if I'd weren't what

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.310 
so to certainly see if I'd weren't what
they<00:02:54.330> taught<00:02:54.540> me<00:02:54.600> at<00:02:54.780> least<00:02:54.959> within<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
they taught me at least within that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.170 
they taught me at least within that
space<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.860> half<00:02:55.980> an<00:02:56.040> hour<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.580> would<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> apply

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
space of half an hour and would I apply

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.449 
space of half an hour and would I apply
it<00:02:57.239> he'd<00:02:57.690> asked<00:02:57.959> me<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.260> look<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.190> what<00:02:59.370> was

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it he'd asked me to look at what was

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.860 
it he'd asked me to look at what was
happening<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> road<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.269> describe<00:03:00.660> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
happening on the road and to describe it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.660 
happening on the road and to describe it
for<00:03:01.200> him<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.500> was<00:03:01.650> driving<00:03:01.860> basically<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> lot

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
for him as I was driving basically a lot

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.880 
for him as I was driving basically a lot
of<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> was<00:03:02.970> justifying<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:04.440> him<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.829> to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
of it was justifying to him and to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.400 
of it was justifying to him and to
myself<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.489> actually<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.660> safe<00:03:06.870> zone<00:03:06.900> right

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
myself I'm actually in a safe zone right

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
myself I'm actually in a safe zone right
now<00:03:07.440> he<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.160> blind<00:03:08.519> spot<00:03:08.940> actually

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
now he was in my blind spot actually

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.699 
now he was in my blind spot actually
he's<00:03:10.140> often<00:03:10.470> accelerated<00:03:11.459> by<00:03:11.790> me<00:03:11.970> stopping

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
he's often accelerated by me stopping

was very slow and what he need in the
future<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.739> was<00:03:31.739> happy<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.459> he<00:03:32.549> was

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670

happy he'd had me mostly ranked as

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.170 
happy he'd had me mostly ranked as
normal<00:03:34.829> for<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.610> areas<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:35.910> might<00:03:36.030> be

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
normal for the areas they might be

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.880 
normal for the areas they might be
improved<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.750> all<00:03:36.870> those<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.290> moved<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.829> to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
improved and in all those I moved up to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.069 
improved and in all those I moved up to
being<00:03:38.190> there<00:03:38.640> doing<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> good<00:03:38.970> job<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.780> was

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
being there doing a good job so I was

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.530 
being there doing a good job so I was
pretty<00:03:41.040> good<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.370> perfect<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.880> was<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.299> was

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
pretty good not perfect but I was I was

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.720 
pretty good not perfect but I was I was
happy<00:03:43.049> with<00:03:43.170> how<00:03:43.290> I'd<00:03:43.440> done<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.519> it

happy with how I'd done I think that it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.330 
happy with how I'd done I think that it
certainly<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.120> beneficial<00:03:45.480> for<00:03:45.900> drivers<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
certainly is beneficial for drivers to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.060 
certainly is beneficial for drivers to
go<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.239> course<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:49.010> like<00:03:50.010> with
