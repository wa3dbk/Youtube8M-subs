00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.339
 king 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.039
 the reality is always the same way it is a little 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.589
 command response that guys then coming hahaha 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.509
 in conference 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 the sun is always what makes the difference 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.369
 availability 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.489
 I think in this change that should be highlighted then what 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.989
 s ... the behavior of a of a terrò that for example there is while 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 before coming to requested to go thorough sticking did it well of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760
 be what he always was 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.610
 almost always close then 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 at the first tip and that created this unpredictability 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.100
 then succeed 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 to have 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.910
 there is total availability to recognize composad behavior of the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 all different where 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.300
 do not give you great visibility because there is to go to close to tighten 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 to regain 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
 and above all to have a coverage of spaces and it becomes fundamental also for the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.860
 companions 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.170
 this is what makes the difference 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.800
 I've been thinking about it for a while 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 new 4 u 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480
 to the 4 4 ​​2 diamond shape 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 or 4 1 3 2 1 you want to call I don't know 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 for now I imagined more as an excuse 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.930
 in my opinion pizarro 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.760
 factors l the lengthening median has already made trequartista 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.670
 he made the median 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.770
 that always went vertically while derossi was the one that always ran 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.799
 the start of the action is enough 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 that will always be what they were going to tease 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.240
 michele because he didn't play with tranquility 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.650
 and they didn't take it in hand 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.880
 then our midfield because if you leave it low 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.530
 they make you stay low you like low level they get mad 2000 times 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 because when it is closed right 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.279
 download our to the left for hysteresis re-download it now are those 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.449
 they would do it by double the way 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.289
 despite availability then 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.059
 you then miss the complaints 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:27.539
 laterals find themselves in the ball in the middle and illy become more 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.609
 difficult to propose the qualities they have 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.019
 area limit 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.420
 inventive of create 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.730
 of creativity on these players and we have already complained before here 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:47.139
 and where it has been more or less 4 3 2 1 is with our players who are 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.779
 these quality soccer players 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:56.009
 that do not have a very big run out of the ground going to close on the outside 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.179
 who have not 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.439
 the mind 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.289
 those features of that player 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.389
 they in the same 8 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.849
 also that recognizes as objective only the reconquest of the ball 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.519
 and the coverage of the spaces as they were said made clothes 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.919
 when I thought I had this chance here 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:20.039
 but it looks a lot like it has a lot to do with this behavior 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.989
 and something previously we had also tried and above all if it has 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.869
 then spoke those characteristics 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:28.289
 of the players 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.909
 that make 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 the rose of Rome and this year here 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.079
 that changes absolutely nothing 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.430
 I don't know the president of Bologna but I know very well 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.969
 in my opinion women have the same qualities as the women 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.339
 men 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.709
 in all jobs all professions 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.479
 they have the same numbers as the men 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.279
 consequently if then maybe one 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:01.249
 knows - free soccer players know - soccer player the roller the important from a 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.159
 management point of view put around cook competitions with people 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.029
 who know how to make it choose precisely 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.029
 Rynair 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:18.060
 from the senses doctor to me he showed then also previously to have 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:22.509
 skills that could be found 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.490
 in the Pope, even in difficult moments, you highlighted 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.129
 great big big personality 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.189
 great tranquility ddd comparison of not 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.840
 go then 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.060
 learn absurd measures 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.740
 always been 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.719
 in the conditions to manage in a very balanced way 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.930
 directly 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.270
 this in my opinion is hahaha I help you post 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.139
 also this moment that I hope is over
