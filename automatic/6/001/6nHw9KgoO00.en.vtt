00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
and they'd be listening to us what we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.780 
and they'd be listening to us what we
want<00:02:40.260> patch<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.770> they<00:02:40.950> don't<00:02:41.310> listen<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
want patch but they don't listen to a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.910 
want patch but they don't listen to a
single<00:02:42.000> thing<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.420> we've<00:02:42.540> said<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.930> another

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
single thing that we've said and another

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.270 
single thing that we've said and another
gun<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:45.120> was<00:02:45.270> patched<00:02:45.540> was<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.770> select<00:02:47.130> fire

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
gun that was patched was the select fire

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
gun that was patched was the select fire
I<00:02:47.340> mean<00:02:47.700> they<00:02:47.820> fix<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> select<00:02:48.420> fire<00:02:48.600> where<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I mean they fix the select fire where it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.900 
I mean they fix the select fire where it
would<00:02:49.290> switch<00:02:49.500> back<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.770> single<00:02:50.130> fire<00:02:50.400> at

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
would switch back to single fire at

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.060 
would switch back to single fire at
during<00:02:51.540> rounds<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:51.960> domination<00:02:52.380> which<00:02:52.920> I'm

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
during rounds and domination which I'm

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.350 
during rounds and domination which I'm
glad<00:02:53.250> they<00:02:53.400> fix<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.030> here's<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.300> thing

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360

so I know how they make this game the
coding<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.699> not<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.300> hard<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:31.320> not

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
coding is not that hard it's really not

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.560 
coding is not that hard it's really not
it's<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.400> even<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.790> complicated<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.540> I
