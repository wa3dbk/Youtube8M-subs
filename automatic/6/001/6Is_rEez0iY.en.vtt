fourth<00:03:53.090> thing<00:03:53.300> there's<00:03:53.510> always<00:03:53.990> cup<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.560> ball

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
fourth thing there's always cup the ball

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.520 
fourth thing there's always cup the ball
what<00:03:55.580> do<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.670> mean<00:03:55.850> by<00:03:55.910> always<00:03:56.420> cup<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> ball<00:03:57.050> we

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
what do I mean by always cup the ball we

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.950 
what do I mean by always cup the ball we
want<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:57.860> always<00:03:58.100> keep<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.880> ball<00:03:59.060> inside<00:03:59.600> and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
want to always keep the ball inside and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.080 
want to always keep the ball inside and
in<00:04:00.050> front<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.410> us<00:04:00.470> never<00:04:01.070> cut<00:04:01.430> off<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.760> pursuit

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
in front of us never cut off the pursuit

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.520 
in front of us never cut off the pursuit
of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.270> defense<00:04:02.630> by<00:04:02.810> letting<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.140> ball<00:04:03.290> get

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
of the defense by letting the ball get

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.520 
of the defense by letting the ball get
outside<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:04.040> us<00:04:04.130> that's<00:04:04.700> an<00:04:04.820> important<00:04:05.240> point

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
outside of us that's an important point

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.440 
outside of us that's an important point
so<00:04:06.530> many<00:04:06.710> defenses<00:04:07.430> give<00:04:07.910> up<00:04:08.030> hidden<00:04:08.240> yardage

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
so many defenses give up hidden yardage

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.850 
so many defenses give up hidden yardage
because<00:04:08.930> they<00:04:09.020> allow<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.290> ball<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.590> get

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
because they allow the ball to get

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.170 
because they allow the ball to get
outside<00:04:10.220> in<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.460> second<00:04:10.820> there<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.060> we've

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
outside in the second there and we've

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.240 
outside in the second there and we've
got<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.420> always<00:04:11.780> cup<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.170> ball<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:13.040> last

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
got to always cup the ball and the last

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.490 
got to always cup the ball and the last
thing<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:14.210> fifth<00:04:14.480> priority<00:04:14.960> that<00:04:15.080> we<00:04:15.170> have<00:04:15.350> is

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
thing the fifth priority that we have is

to backpedal straight we're gonna have

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.770

right and we're going to have to weave

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.320 
right and we're going to have to weave
in<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:59.039> back<00:05:59.220> pedal<00:05:59.580> being<00:05:59.789> able<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.030> go<00:06:00.090> back

from our left into our right turns are

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.200 
from our left into our right turns are
important<00:06:03.210> that's<00:06:03.419> usually<00:06:04.229> where<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:05.370> makes

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
important that's usually where it makes

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.430 
important that's usually where it makes
a<00:06:06.330> difference<00:06:06.479> between<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.810> good<00:06:06.990> defensive

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
a difference between a good defensive

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.020 
a difference between a good defensive
back<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.830> a<00:06:07.860> great<00:06:08.070> defensive<00:06:08.490> back<00:06:08.699> is<00:06:08.880> their

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
back and a great defensive back is their

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.629 
back and a great defensive back is their
ability<00:06:09.150> to<00:06:09.449> get<00:06:09.690> out<00:06:09.780> of<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:09.960> back<00:06:10.169> pedal

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639

transition<00:06:11.639> into<00:06:11.789> a<00:06:11.880> forward<00:06:12.180> run<00:06:12.479> we<00:06:13.139> talked

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
transition into a forward run we talked

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.490 
transition into a forward run we talked
about<00:06:13.530> man<00:06:13.860> turns<00:06:14.190> zone<00:06:14.760> turns<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.389> then<00:06:15.870> we

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
about man turns zone turns and then we

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.890 
about man turns zone turns and then we
call<00:06:16.710> them<00:06:16.830> centerfield<00:06:17.280> turns<00:06:17.460> some<00:06:17.820> people

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
call them centerfield turns some people

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.870 
call them centerfield turns some people
refer<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:18.930> them<00:06:19.260> as<00:06:19.349> speed<00:06:19.650> turns<00:06:19.889> but<00:06:20.550> we<00:06:20.669> talk

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
refer to them as speed turns but we talk

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.250 
refer to them as speed turns but we talk
about<00:06:21.000> three<00:06:21.330> different<00:06:21.419> types<00:06:21.780> of<00:06:21.990> turns

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
about three different types of turns

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.529 
about three different types of turns
with<00:06:22.770> our<00:06:22.919> defensive<00:06:23.400> backs<00:06:23.610> and<00:06:23.880> then<00:06:24.419> our

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
with our defensive backs and then our

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.879 
with our defensive backs and then our
breaks<00:06:24.810> out<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.020> that<00:06:25.169> back<00:06:25.320> pedal<00:06:25.650> how<00:06:25.740> we're
