 piet buter 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 that the two researchers discovered two concepts 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.570
 beh from that moment onwards goes off and the end of the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.550
 renovation work on the city council 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.550

 d 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 it goes here then 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.519
 the club

 a few boys 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.950
 this is not a joke 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.470
 later behind that will likely come true drop of 9 percent though 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.329
 haha 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.299
 a 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.299
 who to 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.749
 love it 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.749
 meanwhile we have to be happy 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.019
 the research shows 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.139
 Hey 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.429

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:59.749
 the two times yellow 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.169
 care 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.169
 You can also have your own court here 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.370
 you have to look here they have me so it's a lot bigger that keep feeding 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.819
 convincing on that you see in the core of the same both sides on the names of 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.340
 the second place is the change of oxygen in condition 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
 9 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.400
 the trick now is news hour 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.729
 4 43 it's the 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.430
 that made the british team that's the reason 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.930
 surrender to manchester united 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.560
 weber in his possession 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.120
 you can not miss according to the defense the defensive midfielder 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.449
 by focusing on the worst 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.779
 the defense i mean trading started that is a huge knife stabbing 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.849
 almost all of them are series almost all of them 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.779
 that is the consequence complaints the morning 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:09.919
 the newspaper 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.180
 we will see what is good and that she will pay that contradicts what 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.569
 is doing 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.770
 adha 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.029
 on the original 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.599
 the american music industry 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.289

 corner 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 Ricky Rivaro us as I started in a cycle 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:50.089
 geertje of a strategy that the 83 recommended the fourth set director 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:54.869
 zoltán szélesi is a wonderful shot opposite the police court we have 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.189
 also never aware this is very sweet 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.629
 as with large department stores on the first day, nothing is wrong 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.770
 but higher will be the central view in the preface 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.569
 why the reason is allowed to work as much as possible from work 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.379
 antibodies 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.379

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.349
 that says 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.800
 the high 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.800
 I hear 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:42.119
 7 

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:47.259
 when i am in the field 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:51.849
 especially 

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.679
 become this structure 

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:06.169
 back in the days
