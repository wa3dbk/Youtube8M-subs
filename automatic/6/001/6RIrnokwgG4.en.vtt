00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.879
 postmail itself calorie is the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.460
 try this time the theme is black 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.320
 can motivate ops 2 in the long term 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 I think so if you own your own 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799
 challandes imposed my first 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 Challenge I have to look or have 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.070
 already behind me and indeed 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.369
 I wanted to be on a big map 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.050
 Well that was just a coincidence but that's how it should be 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 to the challenge on a something 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 bigger map with the pistol which like 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.279
 great unit so the shopper ghana 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 to reach 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 I have done this and I say 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 that's the only way black ops 2 will be for me 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.570
 I think all of them permanently 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.969
 motivate 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 there is still this this 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.100
 emblem or these rush so this 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.690
 sign if you have 30 kills with the weapon 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 has made that there is no nuclear bomb that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.300
 It does not matter that it's just a sign 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.760
 what appears after that he just this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.399
 that you made this challenge then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.649
 have and I start with small 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 things and tries just stop the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 world all unity with the pistol too 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.059
 pick up 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.580
 I still have the care package and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.100
 the spy plane and yes as a weapon 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 of course my favorite pistol the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 b23 r with charlie and magazine 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 Expansion is the most important thing 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 actually magazine extension and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 so charly both and that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.939
 you get on it if you have the voting card 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 redeems secondary weapon 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.500
 there can then two on your weapon 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 edmonds draufmachen then I have in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 first spot at extra 1 neither the wild 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.140
 card taken for extra extra the a1 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.130
 So additional and take it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.540
 white light and ghost, and second 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 I've always plundered with it 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.820
 provided with ammunition time and as 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.399
 third, I have skill that one 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.250
 After the step comes faster insight 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.909
 maybe marathon would be better though 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.890
 Well, and third, I have the c4 and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.079
 Unfortunately , it depends on the points stop 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 not on the man additionally 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.369
 marathon with pure takes that is indeed 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.460
 pity but silencer and magazine 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 extension is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.970
 at the weapon at least if you have such 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.319
 in my opinion wanted to do things 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.280
 I have to say otherwise 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.650
 black ops 2 makes me really upset 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.360
 that kind of nice game makes me that way 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.400
 Bock in the beginning I thought so a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.660
 scrap game so a shit I am 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.520
 not at all clear 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.640
 I have to say that I only 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.950
 really good gameplays travel in 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.970
 ground attack i wonder why 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.489
 but on this on these big maps 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.560
 partial ground thought sky that the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.650
 action if you fix there reasonably 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.800
 on the way is nice 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.570
 killstreaks then at the start and to 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.459
 Shoot confirmed in normal mode 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.400
 I do not really care so much 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.900
 So I have to say floor attack 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.910
 If you should try it I can give you 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 only recommend it is also the first call 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.170
 of duty ground crew just lay what have 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.640
 you have so much for challandes 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.380
 since I want the game is straight 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 Only outside and you also have a lot to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.610
 I unlock with my body 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.940
 gold and now try the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.620
 weapon to get in gold and times 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.600
 see what will meet next 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.190
 maybe something with the crossbow 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.769
 I have the last ones with him now 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.209
 days if funny classes made if 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.010
 that's a real advantage here is a black 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.690
 ops 2 you can be horny 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.700
 make different classes 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.709
 the possibilities are different because 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.260
 you remains the choice which I think they 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.269
 is a little bit of little points teamplay 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.950
 zuende 34 3 I hope you have it 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.950
 at night, a good 1000
