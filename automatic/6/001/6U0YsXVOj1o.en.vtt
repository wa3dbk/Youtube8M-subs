note 10.1 and i will be reviewing the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
note 10.1 and i will be reviewing the
program<00:00:17.010> layer<00:00:17.310> paint<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:19.189> I've<00:00:20.189> been

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
program layer paint for it I've been

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.500 
program layer paint for it I've been
using<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.480> S<00:00:21.750> note<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.920> sketch<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> take

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
using the S note to sketch and take

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.089 
using the S note to sketch and take
notes<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.470> worked<00:00:25.920> out

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
notes but this one actually worked out

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.580 
notes but this one actually worked out
really<00:00:26.340> well<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:27.080> drawing<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
really well for drawing so I'm going to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
really well for drawing so I'm going to
show<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.070> works<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.869> have<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> disabled

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
show you how it works I have it disabled

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
show you how it works I have it disabled
so<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.399> fingers<00:00:32.820> don't<00:00:33.000> interfere<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.690> I'm

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so my fingers don't interfere when I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
so my fingers don't interfere when I'm
drawing<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:35.130> everything<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> use<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
drawing so everything I have to use the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
drawing so everything I have to use the
pen<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> let's<00:00:43.050> paint<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> background<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pen so let's paint the background a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:56.220 
pen so let's paint the background a
color<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.530> transparent

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.510 

this<00:00:56.860> program<00:00:57.250> allows<00:00:57.280> layers<00:00:59.160> as<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.370> can

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
this program allows layers as you can

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.380 
this program allows layers as you can
see<00:01:00.730> there<00:01:05.490> make<00:01:06.490> sure<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.790> change<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.180> color

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
see there make sure we change the color

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.560 
see there make sure we change the color
back<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.260> we<00:01:11.650> can<00:01:11.860> choose<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.420> pen

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
back and we can choose one of the pen

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.109

want make sure you're drawing on the
other<00:01:29.259> layer<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.700> cool<00:01:30.940> thing<00:01:31.090> about<00:01:31.119> this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
other layer the cool thing about this

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.820 
other layer the cool thing about this
program<00:01:31.600> is<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.170> saves<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.770> a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
program is that it saves it in a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.800 
program is that it saves it in a
Photoshop<00:01:33.310> file<00:01:33.550> but<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.180> also<00:01:34.360> export

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
Photoshop file but you can also export

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.020 
Photoshop file but you can also export
it<00:01:34.960> out<00:01:35.050> as<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.229> flattened<00:01:35.770> image<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:36.910> would

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
it out as a flattened image so it would

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.969 
it out as a flattened image so it would
be<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.180> JPEG<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:41.259> can<00:01:41.410> zoom<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.710> with<00:01:41.830> your

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
be a JPEG you can zoom in with your

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.970 
be a JPEG you can zoom in with your
fingers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980 

this<00:01:51.580> program<00:01:51.940> actually<00:01:52.090> does<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.420> really<00:01:52.750> nice

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
this program actually does a really nice

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.290 
this program actually does a really nice
job<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:54.430> sketching<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:57.070> want<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.880> use

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
job for sketching if you want to use

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.150 
job for sketching if you want to use
this<00:01:59.290> program<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:02.080> use<00:02:02.380> layers<00:02:02.800> and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
this program you can use layers and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.070 
this program you can use layers and
everything<00:02:03.520> like<00:02:03.730> s<00:02:03.970> note<00:02:04.330> does<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.780> allow

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
everything like s note does not allow

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.820 
everything like s note does not allow
that<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.870> gives<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.290> option<00:02:08.440> if

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
that so this one gives you the option if

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.690 
that so this one gives you the option if
you<00:02:08.920> wanted<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:11.010> s<00:02:12.010> note<00:02:12.370> still<00:02:12.640> does

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
you wanted to do that s note still does

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.530 
you wanted to do that s note still does
a<00:02:12.880> really<00:02:13.210> good<00:02:13.450> job<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:19.330> for

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
a really good job for what it is but for

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.530 
a really good job for what it is but for
the<00:02:19.630> ones<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:20.020> may<00:02:20.170> want<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:20.890> bit<00:02:21.130> more

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the ones that may want a little bit more

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.130 
the ones that may want a little bit more
get<00:02:22.540> layer<00:02:22.720> paint<00:02:24.420> program<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.690> pretty<00:02:25.840> cheap

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
get layer paint program is pretty cheap

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.410 
get layer paint program is pretty cheap
I<00:02:26.380> think<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.770> about<00:02:26.920> 299<00:02:27.640> you'd<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.300> go

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
I think it's about 299 you'd have to go

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:50.550 
I think it's about 299 you'd have to go
check

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.559 

the<00:02:51.130> neat<00:02:51.310> thing<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.880> there's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> button<00:02:52.360> on

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
the neat thing is is there's a button on

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.589 
the neat thing is is there's a button on
this<00:02:52.780> pen<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.489> toggle<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.090> back<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
this pen and you can toggle it back and

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.250 
this pen and you can toggle it back and
forth<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.650> turns<00:02:59.860> into<00:03:00.010> an<00:03:00.190> eraser<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:02.140> you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
forth so it turns into an eraser and you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.160 
forth so it turns into an eraser and you
press<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.530> again<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.640> then<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.090> click<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.630> it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
press it again and then you click and it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.290 
press it again and then you click and it
turns<00:03:05.380> back<00:03:05.590> into<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.220> pen<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.880> pen

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
turns back into the pen because the pen

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.220 
turns back into the pen because the pen
that<00:03:10.540> comes<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:12.250> app<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:13.050> mean<00:03:14.050> what

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
that comes with this app I mean what

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.949 
that comes with this app I mean what
this<00:03:14.410> device<00:03:15.310> does<00:03:15.550> not<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.239> an<00:03:16.360> eraser<00:03:16.810> but

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
this device does not have an eraser but

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
this device does not have an eraser but
you<00:03:17.050> can<00:03:17.319> use<00:03:17.620> one<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:18.040> an<00:03:18.160> eraser

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
