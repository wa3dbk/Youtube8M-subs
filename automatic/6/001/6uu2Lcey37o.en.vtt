00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
think now I hope I'm wrong man cuz I'm

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
think now I hope I'm wrong man cuz I'm
getting<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> console<00:01:44.250> tomorrow<00:01:44.549> night<00:01:44.729> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
getting the console tomorrow night with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
getting the console tomorrow night with
you<00:01:45.060> guys<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you guys just like you are but if you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
you guys just like you are but if you
think<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.829> makes

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
think now if you think back it all makes

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
think now if you think back it all makes
sense<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.119> Sony<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.750> having<00:01:52.200> these

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sense because if Sony is having these

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.620 
sense because if Sony is having these
issues<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.729> didn't<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.570> out

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
issues they didn't want it to get out

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020 
issues they didn't want it to get out
there<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> still<00:01:56.130> seems<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> doing<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there but it still seems to be doing it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
there but it still seems to be doing it
anyway<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> Taco<00:01:58.560> Bell

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
anyway because you know the Taco Bell

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
anyway because you know the Taco Bell
guys<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.399> their<00:01:59.640> consoles<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.259> journalists

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
guys got their consoles and journalists

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080 
guys got their consoles and journalists
