00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.179
 silent mobility 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 Electric vehicles are no longer seen they are already a reality for them 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.630
 will belong to the future 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.970
 according to the results of a recent poll, 40 percent of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 German already ready today 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 at the next car purchase an electric vehicle in the shortlist too 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.939
 pull 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.550
 Discussion material, however, are the range and especially the recharge 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.550
 of the vehicles 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.830
 So far, charging stations have been used 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.670
 the manufacturers are striving and dissemination and user-friendly application 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.819
 Langenfeld a large basin must be the charging infrastructure and 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.940
 on the spot 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.810
 and we have too 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.400
 important partners won free admission 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.860
 besides European largest European council at the operator Georg oa 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.970
 so we were in the best position in public here 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.790
 At the same time annoying 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.070
 also with you and is innovative in itself 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.210
 In addition to the inserts, the weir for wired laying has been developed 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.130
 have and continue to develop 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 we show a solution for the so-called inductive charging 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.360
 The inductive charging is for the users of Nutzfahrzeuge first time one 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.650
 very comfortable and attractive 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 lowe's around 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.100
 because he just does not get closer a cable out of the vehicle than one 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.550
 such charging station 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.000
 Percent 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.890
 in a later expansion stage, it is conceivable that then the charging process 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.810
 fully automatically the vehicle starts to identify itself at the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.710
 Charging station and as soon as this is done it automatically starts the charging process 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.480
 Clever minds from Munich also had thoughts on the subject neck 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.140
 made 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.940
 a nondescript of the circle division distinguish place 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.970
 far and wide, no late ropes can be seen 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.720
 The little Katharina System is new to Europe 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.280
 A simple 220-volt outlet becomes a charging station 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.760
 how can the one charging station be 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.150
 by bringing in something for base stations and what are stations 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.240
 monitors and protects those with Klose that the concept is that if here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.810
 anyone unauthorized attempting to take power was his consumer because 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.620
 unauthorized is plugged in, the system simply switches to one 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.689
 short time span 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.310
 we do the practical test 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.879
 and lit a consumer 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.289
 it only takes a few seconds 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.289
 and the base station turns off the power 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.089
 How does the system know who can refuel power? 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:38.989
 you have an end 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.260
 Teltschik captain Aigner further electronics one in Africa and in the car 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.069
 has blocked 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.279
 has built and percent identifies to the 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.779
 User or that could and has been charged with that 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.619
 Background System 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.499
 important to end users 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.819
 how time-consuming is it to retrofit your own socket? 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.109
 they actually need one if they already have one 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.950
 Year 16 at the Pearl oath and lie have their garage tight I do nothing next 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.730
 as if using a water station to run current ideally just behind 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.749
 then the fuse box if they have a counters care line then daddy 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.840
 simply replaced by a stronger rescue parachute and that are 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.079
 All the costs are predictable and you electricians 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.409
 can afford 4 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.069
 and the cost of the system itself 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.599
 allegedly still in the three-digit range
