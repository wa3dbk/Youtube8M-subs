00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.060 

now<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> travel<00:02:52.020> video<00:02:52.110> blogger<00:02:52.530> I'm<00:02:52.770> always

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
now as a travel video blogger I'm always

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.890 
now as a travel video blogger I'm always
trying<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.640> improve<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.180> quality<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.660> my<00:02:54.870> work

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
trying to improve the quality of my work

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.310 
trying to improve the quality of my work
one<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.860> those<00:02:55.980> ways<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.790> through

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
one of those ways is through

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.660 
one of those ways is through
stabilization<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> there<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> number<00:02:59.580> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
stabilization and there are a number of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.390 
stabilization and there are a number of
devices<00:03:00.060> obviously<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> oldest<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.650> tried

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
devices obviously the oldest and tried

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
devices obviously the oldest and tried
and<00:03:02.550> trued<00:03:02.760> method<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.590> using<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> tripod

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
and trued method is using a tripod

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.950 
and trued method is using a tripod
however<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:06.270> doesn't<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.720> work<00:03:06.900> for

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
however that doesn't really work for

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.230 
however that doesn't really work for
handheld<00:03:07.590> shots<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.640> you'll<00:03:08.820> get<00:03:09.000> something

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
handheld shots so you'll get something

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.110 
handheld shots so you'll get something
like<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> Steadicam<00:03:10.200> such<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.860> which<00:03:11.760> are

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
like a Steadicam such as this which are

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.560 
like a Steadicam such as this which are
quite<00:03:12.660> good<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> lot<00:03:15.270> of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
quite good but they take a lot of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.030 
quite good but they take a lot of
adjustments<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.440> get<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:19.040> there

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
adjustments to get just right and there

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.190 
adjustments to get just right and there
all<00:03:20.220> these<00:03:20.610> different<00:03:21.030> variables<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.930> mean

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
all these different variables I mean

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.010 
all these different variables I mean
just<00:03:23.070> having<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.520> shut<00:03:23.910> throws<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> whole

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
just having that shut throws the whole

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.120 
just having that shut throws the whole
thing<00:03:25.230> off<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.410> balance<00:03:26.390> with<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.800> faaaa<00:03:28.800> tech

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
thing off of balance with the faaaa tech

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.780 
thing off of balance with the faaaa tech
g4<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.710> don't<00:03:31.860> have<00:03:31.950> those<00:03:32.160> issues<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
g4 you just don't have those issues you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.600 
g4 you just don't have those issues you
just<00:03:32.970> throw<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.300> GoPro<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.370> turn<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.490> on

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
just throw the GoPro on and turn it on

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
just throw the GoPro on and turn it on
you're<00:03:36.300> good<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:41.240> will<00:03:42.240> do<00:03:42.390> some

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
you're good to go I will do some

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.290 
you're good to go I will do some
side-by-side<00:03:43.130> comparisons<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.150> can

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
side-by-side comparisons so that you can

00:03:45.300 --> 00:04:19.479 
side-by-side comparisons so that you can
see<00:03:45.540> what<00:03:45.690> I'm<00:03:45.810> shooting

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.459 

well<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> light<00:04:20.789> was<00:04:21.030> fairly<00:04:21.689> poor<00:04:22.019> on<00:04:22.289> those

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
well the light was fairly poor on those

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.559 
well the light was fairly poor on those
first<00:04:22.680> two<00:04:22.949> examples<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.759> I'm<00:04:24.030> going<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.389> do

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
first two examples so I'm going to do

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.689 
first two examples so I'm going to do
another<00:04:25.050> one<00:04:25.319> and<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:26.370> judge<00:04:26.550> for

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
another one and you can judge for

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.730 
another one and you can judge for
yourself<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.270> stabilization<00:04:28.080> capabilities

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
yourself the stabilization capabilities

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.580 
yourself the stabilization capabilities
of<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:28.979> g4<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.849> you<00:04:30.120> may<00:04:30.270> want<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.599> test<00:04:31.379> out

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
of the g4 and you may want to test out

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.170 
of the g4 and you may want to test out
the<00:04:31.740> different<00:04:32.069> modes<00:04:32.310> depending<00:04:32.580> on<00:04:33.029> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
the different modes depending on the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:53.830 
the different modes depending on the
types<00:04:33.569> of<00:04:33.810> shots<00:04:34.050> you're<00:04:34.319> trying<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.800> capture

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.709 

now<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:55.379> started<00:04:55.740> using<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.189> g4<00:04:56.759> so<00:04:57.330> like

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
now I just started using the g4 so like

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.959 
now I just started using the g4 so like
any<00:04:57.960> new<00:04:58.259> tool<00:04:58.560> it'll<00:04:59.039> take<00:04:59.340> some<00:04:59.550> time<00:04:59.789> to

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
any new tool it'll take some time to

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.179 
any new tool it'll take some time to
learn<00:05:00.120> best<00:05:00.509> practices<00:05:01.229> in<00:05:01.319> order<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.710> capture

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.189 
learn best practices in order to capture

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.850 
learn best practices in order to capture
the<00:05:02.310> best<00:05:02.460> possible<00:05:03.060> footage<00:05:03.539> with<00:05:04.319> that<00:05:04.500> said

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
the best possible footage with that said

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.820 
the best possible footage with that said
I<00:05:05.099> think<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.639> FEA<00:05:05.879> tech<00:05:06.180> g4<00:05:06.719> is<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.169> great

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
I think the FEA tech g4 is a great

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.159 
I think the FEA tech g4 is a great
addition<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.370> my<00:05:08.490> camera<00:05:09.060> bag<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.689> tools

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
addition to my camera bag of tools

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.149 
addition to my camera bag of tools
however<00:05:10.979> at<00:05:11.759> 375<00:05:12.719> dollars<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.710> certainly

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
however at 375 dollars it is certainly

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:37.050 
however at 375 dollars it is certainly
not<00:05:14.370> for<00:05:14.699> everyone

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.850 

well<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.090> hope<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:38.510> video<00:05:38.720> on<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.230> FEA<00:05:39.560> tech

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
well I hope this video on the FEA tech

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.790 
well I hope this video on the FEA tech
