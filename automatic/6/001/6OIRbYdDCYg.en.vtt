the back and a button to call the
bottles<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.180> I've<00:00:36.180> used<00:00:36.329> different

bottles here I've used different

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.229 
bottles here I've used different
materials<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.559> love<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.879> nether

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
materials I love the way that the nether

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.530 
materials I love the way that the nether
brick<00:00:39.420> works<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> mossy<00:00:40.559> stone<00:00:40.860> these

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
brick works with the mossy stone these

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.670 
brick works with the mossy stone these
redstone<00:00:42.540> torches<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.170> actually<00:00:43.350> do

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
redstone torches which actually do

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.610 
redstone torches which actually do
nothing<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.670> good<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.410> fence

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
nothing but just look good and the fence

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.970 
nothing but just look good and the fence
posts<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:48.000> half<00:00:48.690> slabs<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
posts and these half slabs I like the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
posts and these half slabs I like the
way<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> looks<00:00:50.190> together<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.690> looks

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
way it looks together I think it looks

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.709 
way it looks together I think it looks
kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> slightly<00:00:53.789> creepy<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
kind of kind of slightly creepy and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
kind of kind of slightly creepy and
eldritch<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.149> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> potion

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
eldritch and kind of like a potion

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.830 
eldritch and kind of like a potion
brewing<00:00:57.989> room<00:00:58.940> essentially<00:00:59.940> though<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.449> works

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
brewing room essentially though it works

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
brewing room essentially though it works
in<00:01:01.079> exactly<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.770> ethos<00:01:02.190> I've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
in exactly so my ethos I've got this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
in exactly so my ethos I've got this
little<00:01:03.809> piston<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.830> captures<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little piston thing which captures you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
little piston thing which captures you
stopped<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> moving<00:01:06.689> away<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
stopped you moving away and out of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
stopped you moving away and out of
position<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:10.049> press<00:01:11.040> any<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
position it you can press any of the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
position it you can press any of the
buttons<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.600> access<00:01:12.990> any<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
buttons you can access any of the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.740 
buttons you can access any of the
brewing<00:01:13.650> stands<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:15.270> 10<00:01:15.509> brewing

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
brewing stands and this 10 brewing

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
brewing stands and this 10 brewing
stands<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> reason<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.400> eco

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
stands and the reason for that is as eco

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690 
stands and the reason for that is as eco
pointed<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> put<00:01:19.920> an<00:01:20.159> ingredient

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
pointed out if you put an ingredient

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
pointed out if you put an ingredient
into<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
into this one and then this one and so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
into this one and then this one and so
on<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:22.950> around<00:01:23.070> once<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> finish

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
on all the way around once you finish

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.730 
on all the way around once you finish
the<00:01:24.180> tenth<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> first

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the tenth you can go back to the first

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.300 
the tenth you can go back to the first
and<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> ready<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> next<00:01:26.820> ingredient

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and it's ready for the next ingredient

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
and it's ready for the next ingredient
so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.670> buttons<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.180> call<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> ingredients

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so the buttons all call the ingredients

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.450 
so the buttons all call the ingredients
which<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.650> down<00:01:31.860> through<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> whole

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
which come down through this whole

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.770 
which come down through this whole
exactly<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.150> etho<00:01:33.540> had<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.600> main

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
exactly like etho had it and the main

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.749 
exactly like etho had it and the main
difference<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> probably<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.640> up

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
difference is as you probably can see up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.310 
difference is as you probably can see up
there<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:41.030> four<00:01:42.030> stacks<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.780> three

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there I have four stacks of three

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.300 
there I have four stacks of three
dispensers<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.689> dispenser

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
dispensers so that's one dispenser

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
dispensers so that's one dispenser
ingredient<00:01:47.509> plus<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.750> extra<00:01:48.869> 24<00:01:49.409> bottles<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
ingredient plus an extra 24 bottles so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
ingredient plus an extra 24 bottles so
there's<00:01:50.430> three<00:01:50.610> dispensers<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.240> total<00:01:51.600> for

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
there's three dispensers in total for

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.819 
there's three dispensers in total for
the<00:01:51.810> bottles<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.290> each<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the bottles because each one of the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980 
the bottles because each one of the
stands<00:01:53.070> requires<00:01:53.549> three<00:01:53.850> bottles<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
stands requires three bottles and the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.400 
and fill up the stance so then you can
go<00:02:18.980> around<00:02:19.300> filling<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.420> stands<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.140> that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
go around filling up stands like that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.590 
go around filling up stands like that
and<00:02:21.710> then<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.460> call<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.120> ingredients

filling up filling up the burn stands

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.500 
filling up filling up the burn stands
like<00:02:38.570> this<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:40.000> if<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> go<00:02:41.270> all<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> way

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
like this and if you go all the way

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.630 
like this and if you go all the way
around<00:02:41.830> by<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.890> time<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.130> finish<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.430> one

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
around by the time you finish this one

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.890 
around by the time you finish this one
you<00:02:43.760> can<00:02:43.790> call<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> next<00:02:44.270> ingredient<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
you can call the next ingredient and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.480 
you can call the next ingredient and
immediately<00:02:45.410> start<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.250> great<00:02:46.430> way

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
immediately start and it's a great way

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.360 
immediately start and it's a great way
of<00:02:46.720> getting<00:02:47.720> 30<00:02:48.080> potions<00:02:48.620> brewed<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.160> very

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
of getting 30 potions brewed in a very

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.400 
of getting 30 potions brewed in a very
short<00:02:49.400> space<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.850> time<00:02:50.030> actually<00:02:50.720> fantastic<00:02:50.930> i

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
short space of time actually fantastic i

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.010 
short space of time actually fantastic i
judging<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:53.180> yeah<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.450> main<00:02:53.600> difference

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
judging so yeah the main difference

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.560 
judging so yeah the main difference
between<00:02:54.380> mine<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:54.920> ethos<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.270> fact<00:02:56.480> that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
between mine and ethos is the fact that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.740 
between mine and ethos is the fact that
i<00:02:56.750> wanted<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.500> dispenser<00:02:58.190> /<00:02:58.910> ingredient<00:02:59.540> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
i wanted one dispenser / ingredient and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.810 
i wanted one dispenser / ingredient and
there's<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.350> couple<00:03:00.770> of<00:03:00.830> reasons<00:03:00.950> i<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.580> do

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
there's a couple of reasons i want to do

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.930 
there's a couple of reasons i want to do
this<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.960> main<00:03:03.110> one<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.830> don't<00:03:04.340> want<00:03:04.490> 10

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
this the main one is I don't want 10

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.730 
this the main one is I don't want 10
dispensers<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.960> have<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.290> kind<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.530> balance

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
dispensers to have to kind of balance

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.890 
dispensers to have to kind of balance
ingredients<00:03:07.520> between<00:03:07.850> make<00:03:08.120> sure<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:08.630> isn't

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
ingredients between make sure one isn't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.199 
ingredients between make sure one isn't
going<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.080> run<00:03:09.230> out<00:03:09.260> before<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.860> others<00:03:10.209> and

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
going to run out before the others and

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.540 
going to run out before the others and
also<00:03:11.330> I'm<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:11.900> going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.709> many

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
also I'm not going to have that many

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.930 
also I'm not going to have that many
ingredients<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:14.360> dispenser<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.080> hold<00:03:15.350> 64<00:03:16.250> x<00:03:16.550> 9

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
ingredients a dispenser can hold 64 x 9

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.870 
ingredients a dispenser can hold 64 x 9
I<00:03:17.270> mean<00:03:17.600> that's<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.900> lot<00:03:18.190> especially<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.640> things

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
I mean that's a lot especially of things

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.760 
I mean that's a lot especially of things
like<00:03:20.150> gas<00:03:20.900> tears<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.530> things<00:03:22.010> like<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.220> so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
like gas tears and things like that so

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.520 
like gas tears and things like that so
one<00:03:24.770> dispenser<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.340> what<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.520> wanted<00:03:26.530> there's

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
one dispenser is what I wanted there's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.960 
one dispenser is what I wanted there's
an<00:03:27.650> extra<00:03:27.920> couple<00:03:28.100> from<00:03:28.310> bottles<00:03:28.700> as<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
an extra couple from bottles as I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.690 
an extra couple from bottles as I
mentioned<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:30.410> way<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.709> works<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.250> each

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
mentioned and the way that works is each

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.510 
mentioned and the way that works is each
dispenser<00:03:32.510> has<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:33.050> clock<00:03:33.410> circuit<00:03:33.680> attached

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
dispenser has a clock circuit attached

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.360 
dispenser has a clock circuit attached
to<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:36.020> was<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> bit<00:03:36.320> tricky<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.680> get<00:03:37.190> each

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
to it it was a bit tricky to get each

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.180 
to it it was a bit tricky to get each
dispenser<00:03:37.970> solve<00:03:38.239> individually<00:03:39.190> operated

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
dispenser solve individually operated

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.400 
dispenser solve individually operated
but<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.209> clocks<00:03:41.420> are<00:03:41.570> very<00:03:41.720> simple<00:03:42.080> they<00:03:42.230> just

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
but the clocks are very simple they just

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.920 
but the clocks are very simple they just
use<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.590> torch<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.640> redstone<00:03:44.060> sorry<00:03:44.870> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
use a torch and a redstone sorry a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.560 
use a torch and a redstone sorry a
repeater<00:03:45.680> which<00:03:46.280> goes<00:03:46.820> back<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.150> there<00:03:47.360> and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
repeater which goes back in there and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.800 
repeater which goes back in there and
then<00:03:47.780> they<00:03:47.989> are<00:03:48.190> disabled<00:03:49.190> by<00:03:49.480> applying<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
then they are disabled by applying a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.660 
then they are disabled by applying a
power<00:03:51.050> line<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.130> block<00:03:52.280> with<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.489> torch

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
power line to the block with the torch

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.830 
power line to the block with the torch
on<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.030> then<00:03:53.810> when<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.170> press<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.680> button

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
on and then when you press the button

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.440 
on and then when you press the button
basically<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.959> flips<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.590> latch<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.450> these

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
basically it flips a latch and these

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.320 
basically it flips a latch and these
these<00:04:00.200> are<00:04:00.260> latches<00:04:00.860> which<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.280> found<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
these are latches which I found on the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.880 
these are latches which I found on the
the<00:04:02.720> forum<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.920> post<00:04:04.700> by<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.390> guy<00:04:05.690> called<00:04:05.720> jxu<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the forum a post by a guy called jxu and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.890 
the forum a post by a guy called jxu and
I<00:04:06.920> am<00:04:07.400> very<00:04:07.430> very<00:04:07.820> grateful<00:04:08.060> because<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.750> was

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
I am very very grateful because I was

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.270 
I am very very grateful because I was
having<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.140> lot<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.290> trouble<00:04:09.680> trying<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.010> figure

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
having a lot of trouble trying to figure

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.420 
having a lot of trouble trying to figure
out<00:04:10.310> how<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:11.480> going<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.630> attach<00:04:12.019> latches<00:04:12.709> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
out how I was going to attach latches to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.580 
out how I was going to attach latches to
the<00:04:13.970> buttons<00:04:14.269> which<00:04:14.480> are<00:04:14.690> tightly<00:04:15.109> packed<00:04:15.410> in

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
the buttons which are tightly packed in

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.740 
the buttons which are tightly packed in
the<00:04:15.680> potion<00:04:16.070> room<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:17.150> yeah<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.450> little

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
the potion room but yeah this little

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.720 
the potion room but yeah this little
design<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.170> great<00:04:18.220> uses<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.250> piston

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
design is great uses a piston

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.820 
design is great uses a piston
so<00:04:20.660> you've<00:04:20.780> got<00:04:20.810> this<00:04:20.960> torch<00:04:21.260> powering<00:04:21.740> this

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
so you've got this torch powering this

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.220 
so you've got this torch powering this
block<00:04:22.160> powering<00:04:22.730> these<00:04:22.850> two<00:04:23.090> repeaters<00:04:23.480> this

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
block powering these two repeaters this

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.500 
block powering these two repeaters this
one<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.950> output<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:25.700> when<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.150> goes<00:04:26.270> out

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
one is the output so when it goes out

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.960 
one is the output so when it goes out
because<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> piston<00:04:27.230> retracts<00:04:27.730> this<00:04:28.730> torch

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
because the piston retracts this torch

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.640 
because the piston retracts this torch
can<00:04:29.180> go<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:29.690> that's<00:04:29.870> your<00:04:29.960> output<00:04:30.380> and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
can go on and that's your output and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.950 
can go on and that's your output and
then<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.240> basically<00:04:32.240> when<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.450> button<00:04:32.690> pops

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
then this basically when the button pops

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.570 
then this basically when the button pops
out<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.460> torch<00:04:36.130> basically<00:04:37.130> stops<00:04:37.370> that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
out this torch basically stops that

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.520 
out this torch basically stops that
torch<00:04:37.850> from<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.300> back<00:04:38.600> on<00:04:38.870> when<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.350> button

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
torch from going back on when the button

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.580 
torch from going back on when the button
puts<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.010> put<00:04:40.400> our<00:04:40.610> pops<00:04:41.180> out<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:42.410> that's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
puts that put our pops out and that's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.500 
puts that put our pops out and that's
what<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:42.950> repeaters<00:04:43.490> full<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:44.360> just

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
what this repeaters full and then just

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.050 
what this repeaters full and then just
to<00:04:44.630> reset<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.020> I've<00:04:45.860> got<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> common<00:04:46.460> reset<00:04:46.820> line

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
to reset it I've got a common reset line

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.330 
to reset it I've got a common reset line
they're<00:04:47.300> all<00:04:47.420> all<00:04:48.320> connected<00:04:48.800> together<00:04:48.950> and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
they're all all connected together and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.100 
they're all all connected together and
these<00:04:49.790> repeaters<00:04:50.150> apply<00:04:50.540> power<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.990> this

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
these repeaters apply power to this

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.610 
these repeaters apply power to this
block<00:04:51.350> allows<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.950> torch<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.310> go<00:04:52.430> off<00:04:52.580> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
block allows that torch to go off and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.920 
block allows that torch to go off and
the<00:04:54.620> piston<00:04:54.980> then<00:04:55.130> extends<00:04:55.670> again<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
the piston then extends again so the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.320 
the piston then extends again so the
reset<00:04:57.260> lines<00:04:57.470> are<00:04:57.980> connected<00:04:58.340> from<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
reset lines are connected from the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.500 
reset lines are connected from the
outputs<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.840> uses<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> common<00:05:00.830> reset<00:05:01.190> line<00:05:01.510> so

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
outputs the uses a common reset line so

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.780 
outputs the uses a common reset line so
those<00:05:02.690> four<00:05:03.080> there<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:04.100> those<00:05:04.340> three<00:05:04.520> there

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
those four there so those three there

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.990 
those four there so those three there
those<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.420> these<00:05:05.900> four<00:05:06.140> here<00:05:06.400> all<00:05:07.400> come<00:05:07.670> into

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
those for these four here all come into

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.840 
those for these four here all come into
the<00:05:08.810> reset<00:05:09.140> here<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.560> then<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.490> fall<00:05:10.700> around

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
the reset here and then the fall around

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.140 
the reset here and then the fall around
this<00:05:11.000> side<00:05:11.240> another<00:05:12.100> reset<00:05:13.100> line<00:05:13.280> comes<00:05:13.970> in

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
this side another reset line comes in

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.500 
this side another reset line comes in
there<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.620> resets<00:05:16.010> very<00:05:16.340> simple<00:05:16.790> it's

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
there and the resets very simple it's

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.080 
there and the resets very simple it's
just<00:05:17.780> basically<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.230> delay<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.980> 18<00:05:19.520> repeaters

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
just basically a delay of 18 repeaters

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.140 
just basically a delay of 18 repeaters
set<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.930> four<00:05:21.320> tix<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.370> use<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> pulse

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
set to four tix and I use a pulse

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.680 
set to four tix and I use a pulse
shortener<00:05:23.660> just<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.940> just<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.000> put<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.240> pulse<00:05:26.510> in

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
shortener just to just to put a pulse in

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.000 
shortener just to just to put a pulse in
there<00:05:26.930> I'll<00:05:27.500> demonstrate<00:05:27.800> our<00:05:28.250> call<00:05:28.520> some

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
there I'll demonstrate our call some

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.870 
there I'll demonstrate our call some
glycerin<00:05:31.010> melons<00:05:31.340> why<00:05:31.520> not<00:05:31.960> so<00:05:32.960> here<00:05:33.110> we<00:05:33.200> go

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
glycerin melons why not so here we go

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880 
glycerin melons why not so here we go
pulses<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.030> there<00:05:35.270> see<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.960> going<00:05:36.290> around<00:05:36.560> and

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
pulses in there see it going around and

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.250 
pulses in there see it going around and
the<00:05:37.430> reason<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.790> wanted<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> pulse<00:05:38.450> is<00:05:38.840> so<00:05:39.110> that

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
the reason I wanted a pulse is so that

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.080 
the reason I wanted a pulse is so that
when<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.560> finish<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:40.310> you<00:05:40.580> can<00:05:40.730> hear<00:05:40.970> the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
when you finish and you can hear the

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.380 
when you finish and you can hear the
piston<00:05:41.680> reset<00:05:42.700> gives<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.820> an<00:05:43.910> audible

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
piston reset gives you an audible

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.110 
piston reset gives you an audible
indication<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.230> it's<00:05:45.380> finished<00:05:46.120> there's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
indication that it's finished there's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.230 
indication that it's finished there's
your<00:05:47.240> glycerin<00:05:47.630> melons<00:05:49.060> basically<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.120> don't

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
your glycerin melons basically you don't

have to wait for all of these repeaters
to<00:05:52.280> become<00:05:52.580> unpowered<00:05:52.970> before<00:05:53.390> you<00:05:53.450> can<00:05:53.570> press

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
to become unpowered before you can press

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.690 
to become unpowered before you can press
the<00:05:53.960> next<00:05:54.110> one<00:05:54.380> otherwise<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:55.040> reset<00:05:55.400> doesn't

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
the next one otherwise the reset doesn't

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.780 
the next one otherwise the reset doesn't
work<00:05:56.350> and<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.680> just<00:05:57.860> allows<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.310> clock<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.670> go

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
work and it just allows the clock to go

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.340 
work and it just allows the clock to go
on<00:05:58.970> send<00:05:59.660> 10<00:05:59.870> pulses<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.920> dispenser<00:06:02.350> it's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
on send 10 pulses to the dispenser it's

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.780 
on send 10 pulses to the dispenser it's
a<00:06:03.380> nice<00:06:03.530> compact<00:06:04.010> design<00:06:05.230> it's<00:06:06.230> about<00:06:06.320> 17<00:06:07.100> x<00:06:07.340> 19
