00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
probably just look white but there's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210 
probably just look white but there's
that<00:02:48.600> one<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.080> know<00:02:49.290> there<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.069> see

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that one I don't know there you can see

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.509 
that one I don't know there you can see
there<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.420> already<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.260> tell<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> this

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
there so already you can tell that this

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.430 
there so already you can tell that this
one<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.760> slightly<00:02:54.209> less<00:02:54.540> frost<00:02:54.930> year<00:02:55.230> which<00:02:55.410> is

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
one is slightly less frost year which is

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.259 
one is slightly less frost year which is
why<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.519> kind<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.790> blends<00:02:57.090> into

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
why I like it it kind of blends into

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.900 
why I like it it kind of blends into
your<00:02:57.480> skin<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.840> little<00:02:58.049> bit<00:02:58.140> more<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.610> guess

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
your skin a little bit more I guess

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.930 
your skin a little bit more I guess
since<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.239> not<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.870> bright<00:03:01.470> white<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.760> base

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
since it's not so bright white the base

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.270 
since it's not so bright white the base
it's<00:03:03.239> more<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.569> pink<00:03:04.440> base<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.130> little

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
it's more of a pink base it's a little

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.900 
it's more of a pink base it's a little
more<00:03:05.580> subtle<00:03:06.060> than<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.890> others<00:03:08.160> that's<00:03:08.730> why<00:03:08.880> I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
more subtle than the others that's why I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
more subtle than the others that's why I
like<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.299> one<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:10.260> only<00:03:10.500> thing<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.950> will

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
like this one the only thing that I will

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.830 
like this one the only thing that I will
say<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.670> they<00:03:11.790> are<00:03:11.820> extremely<00:03:12.299> similar

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
say is that they are extremely similar

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.710 
say is that they are extremely similar
and<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.680> eight<00:03:14.459> or<00:03:14.640> nine<00:03:14.790> dollars<00:03:15.209> versus

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and this is eight or nine dollars versus

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.050 
and this is eight or nine dollars versus
thirteen<00:03:16.109> or<00:03:16.230> fourteen<00:03:16.260> dollars<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
thirteen or fourteen dollars so if you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
are on a tight budget I would just opt

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.900

do a swatch and petticoat might be a bad
i<00:03:29.940> myself<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.540> compare<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.959> because<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.440> one

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
i myself to compare to because this one

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.250 
i myself to compare to because this one
had<00:03:31.829> quite<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> bit<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.910> pigmentation<00:03:33.480> actually

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
had quite a bit of pigmentation actually

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.460 
had quite a bit of pigmentation actually
i<00:03:34.470> use<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> blush<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:37.079> can<00:03:37.260> probably

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
i use it as a blush you can probably

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.370 
i use it as a blush you can probably
already<00:03:37.920> tell<00:03:38.280> there<00:03:38.489> but<00:03:38.790> let's<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.690> watch

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
already tell there but let's just watch

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.970 
already tell there but let's just watch
that<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.100> do<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> heavy<00:03:41.489> swatch<00:03:41.790> now<00:03:42.569> i<00:03:43.170> think

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
that you do a heavy swatch now i think

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.150 
that you do a heavy swatch now i think
for<00:03:44.310> our<00:03:44.370> drugs<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.880> store<00:03:45.540> dupe<00:03:45.959> they<00:03:46.950> work

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
for our drugs to store dupe they work

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.870 
for our drugs to store dupe they work
great<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.540> petticoat<00:03:48.959> one

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
great that is the petticoat one

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.520 
great that is the petticoat one
you<00:03:50.090> can<00:03:50.240> see<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.420> little<00:03:50.660> shimmer<00:03:51.020> of<00:03:51.230> pink

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
you can see that little shimmer of pink

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.490 
you can see that little shimmer of pink
so<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.460> think<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.000> they<00:03:53.240> are<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.540> great<00:03:53.870> dupe<00:03:54.230> if

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
so I think that they are a great dupe if

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.380 
so I think that they are a great dupe if
you<00:03:54.830> cannot<00:03:55.100> afford<00:03:55.310> mineralized<00:03:56.180> skin

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
you cannot afford mineralized skin

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.150 
you cannot afford mineralized skin

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
blushes a little more um easier so i

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.610 
blushes a little more um easier so i
highly<00:04:54.800> recommend<00:04:55.490> these<00:04:55.670> both<00:04:56.300> but<00:04:56.930> probably

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620

and<00:05:51.410> then<00:05:51.650> I<00:05:51.680> think<00:05:51.950> it's<00:05:52.040> more<00:05:52.190> than<00:05:52.550> this

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
and then I think it's more than this

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.990 
and then I think it's more than this
actually

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
actually

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.600

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
the mineralized skin finish this is 10

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.250 
the mineralized skin finish this is 10
gram<00:05:56.910> so<00:05:57.240> I<00:05:57.270> guess<00:05:57.510> this<00:05:57.660> one's<00:05:57.870> still<00:05:57.960> wins

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
gram so I guess this one's still wins

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.410 
gram so I guess this one's still wins
I'm<00:05:59.040> not<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.460> type<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.640> person<00:05:59.790> who's<00:06:00.240> like

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.910
