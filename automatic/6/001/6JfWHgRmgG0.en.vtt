00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900 
are sadly mistaken he is the most
inaccurate<00:00:52.230> thing<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.100> ever<00:00:53.309> seen<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.879> my

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
inaccurate thing I have ever seen in my

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
inaccurate thing I have ever seen in my
life<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.539> look<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.020> he<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.320> keeps

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
life and look at that he just keeps

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
life and look at that he just keeps
digging<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:57.059> gotten<00:00:57.300> hit<00:00:57.510> while

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
digging now I have gotten hit while

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
digging now I have gotten hit while
standing<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.840> it's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
standing like this but it's not all that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.109 
standing like this but it's not all that
common<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.239> should<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.510> fine<00:01:05.119> but

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
common so I think you should be fine but

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
common so I think you should be fine but
yeah<00:01:06.360> he<00:01:06.600> uh<00:01:06.630> basically<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.560> keep<00:01:07.710> doing

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
yeah he uh basically just keep doing

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.230 
yeah he uh basically just keep doing
that<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> you'll<00:01:08.490> keep<00:01:08.640> digging<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> hole

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that and you'll keep digging that hole

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.710 
that and you'll keep digging that hole
right<00:01:09.900> over<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.970> digging<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
right over there see just digging and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
right over there see just digging and
digging<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> digging<00:01:13.220> it's<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.400> useful

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
digging and digging it's very useful

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
digging and digging it's very useful
actually<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.299> mean<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.439> be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
actually I mean I think it would be

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually I mean I think it would be
useful<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.350> let's<00:01:19.619> quickly<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.189> back

like<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.079> probably<00:01:55.229> only

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
like this and this will probably only

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.539 
like this and this will probably only
work<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> spawn<00:01:56.579> egg<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.950> sorry<00:01:58.950> vanilla

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
work with a spawn egg so sorry vanilla

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.139 
work with a spawn egg so sorry vanilla
users<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.409> able<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
users but you're not gonna be able to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
users but you're not gonna be able to
really<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.240> able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.450> achieve<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:04.130> because

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
really be able to achieve this because

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.830 
really be able to achieve this because
when<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> try<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> lead<00:02:06.180> him<00:02:06.299> into<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> space

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
when you try to lead him into a space

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.339 
when you try to lead him into a space
like<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:08.209> he'll<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:09.750> actually<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.080> my<00:02:10.140> test

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
like that he'll well actually on my test

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.240 
like that he'll well actually on my test
this<00:02:10.500> early<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.979> don't<00:02:11.099> think<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this early because I don't think I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.040 
this early because I don't think I
actually<00:02:11.310> fully<00:02:11.760> tested<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.330> Oh

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
actually fully tested this Oh

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.470 
actually fully tested this Oh
Oh<00:02:13.460> nope<00:02:14.700> die<00:02:16.160> alright<00:02:17.160> let's<00:02:17.460> see<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.330> I'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
Oh nope die alright let's see so if I'm

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.920 
Oh nope die alright let's see so if I'm
away<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:18.780> him<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.560> spawn<00:02:19.920> him<00:02:20.040> in

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
away from him and then I spawn him in

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.970 
away from him and then I spawn him in
okay<00:02:21.930> he<00:02:22.140> doesn't<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> work<00:02:22.710> for<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
okay he doesn't want to work for that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.660 
okay he doesn't want to work for that
one<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.400> he<00:02:23.490> works<00:02:23.760> perfectly<00:02:24.330> for<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.660> one

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
one but he works perfectly for this one

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.040 
one but he works perfectly for this one
but<00:02:26.670> basically<00:02:27.030> though<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> had<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> shape<00:02:27.690> very

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
but basically though I had a shape very

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.010 
but basically though I had a shape very
similar<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:29.330> basically<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.600> actually

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
similar to this basically this actually

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.680 
similar to this basically this actually
I<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.820> spawned<00:02:33.090> them<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I think and I spawned them in there and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
I think and I spawned them in there and
you<00:02:33.780> spawned<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.230> know<00:02:34.460> facing<00:02:35.460> forward<00:02:35.820> if

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you spawned you know facing forward if

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
you spawned you know facing forward if
that's<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.630> directional<00:02:37.110> thing<00:02:37.290> actually<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that's a directional thing actually it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's a directional thing actually it
might<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.750> no<00:02:39.750> okay<00:02:40.080> well<00:02:40.530> he's<00:02:40.770> being

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
might be no okay well he's being

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.530 
might be no okay well he's being
stubborn<00:02:41.250> right<00:02:41.430> now<00:02:41.550> but<00:02:41.820> anyway<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.330> use

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
stubborn right now but anyway so I use

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
stubborn right now but anyway so I use
the<00:02:42.630> shape<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:42.990> spawned<00:02:43.530> him<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.770> he

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the shape like that spawned him in he

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.910 
the shape like that spawned him in he
spawned<00:02:44.550> forward<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.830> them

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
spawned forward and then I have them

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.700 
spawned forward and then I have them
like<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:48.960> what<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.500> do

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
like this and so then what you can do

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.760 
like this and so then what you can do
with<00:02:49.950> said<00:02:50.250> gassed<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:51.000> decorate<00:02:51.930> him<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.590> your

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
with said gassed is decorate him to your

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.540 
with said gassed is decorate him to your
heart's<00:02:53.010> content

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
heart's content

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.090 
heart's content
give<00:02:54.210> him<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> name<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.630> everything<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
give him a name and everything now the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
give him a name and everything now the
only<00:02:56.430> problem<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.000> though<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.420> if

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
only problem with this though is that if

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720 
only problem with this though is that if
you<00:02:57.810> run<00:02:58.050> into<00:02:58.500> him<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.040> hate<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.250> miss<00:02:59.610> it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you run into him and I hate to miss it

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.800 
you run into him and I hate to miss it
because<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> minute<00:03:00.360> at<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.630> later

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
because I know a minute at first later

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.180 
because I know a minute at first later
he<00:03:01.560> gets<00:03:01.830> all<00:03:02.010> screwed<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.570> however<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.950> is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
he gets all screwed up however this is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.680 
he gets all screwed up however this is
the<00:03:05.250> part<00:03:05.460> where<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.760> still<00:03:06.210> possible<00:03:06.360> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the part where it's still possible in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.990 
the part where it's still possible in
vanilla<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.830> even<00:03:08.340> if<00:03:08.430> he's<00:03:08.550> facing<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
vanilla because even if he's facing that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040 
vanilla because even if he's facing that
way<00:03:10.670> he<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:11.820> still<00:03:12.090> shoot<00:03:12.300> at<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.570> from<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
way he will still shoot at you from the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.500 
way he will still shoot at you from the
same<00:03:13.260> exact<00:03:13.620> spot<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:15.030> still<00:03:15.330> works

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
same exact spot and this still works

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.040 
same exact spot and this still works
just<00:03:15.960> you<00:03:16.470> lose<00:03:16.680> your<00:03:16.890> kind<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.280> uh

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
just you lose your kind of uh
