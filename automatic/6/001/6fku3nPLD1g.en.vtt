to say that the Funko vinyl collectibles
are<00:02:17.690> probably<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.380> my<00:02:18.470> favorites<00:02:18.950> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
are probably one of my favorites to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.670 
are probably one of my favorites to
collect<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.540> because<00:02:20.840> they<00:02:20.989> do<00:02:21.110> put<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.380> lot

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
collect just because they do put a lot

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.710 
collect just because they do put a lot
of<00:02:21.709> detail<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:23.120> fact<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.390> they<00:02:23.569> have

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
of detail and the fact that they have

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
of detail and the fact that they have
the<00:02:23.810> cutie<00:02:24.079> mark<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.410> both<00:02:24.650> sides<00:02:24.950> which<00:02:25.250> is
