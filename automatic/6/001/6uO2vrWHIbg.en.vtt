screwed<00:02:13.160> us<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.459> yeah<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.390> know<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.569> had<00:02:14.720> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
screwed us up yeah not know I had to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.650 
screwed us up yeah not know I had to
switch<00:02:15.140> back<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.640> he<00:02:16.760> couldn't<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.450> lost

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
switch back but he couldn't so we lost

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.600 
switch back but he couldn't so we lost
the<00:02:17.840> car<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:21.920> we're<00:02:22.190> basically

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the car and so now we're basically

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.660 
the car and so now we're basically
screwed<00:02:22.819> over<00:02:23.300> yeah<00:02:24.170> there's<00:02:25.129> no<00:02:25.340> way<00:02:25.520> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
screwed over yeah there's no way of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.930 
screwed over yeah there's no way of
winning<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.819> guess<00:02:29.030> I'll<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.390> kill<00:02:29.720> myself

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.630 

but<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.120> guess<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.750> forgot<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.280> respawn
