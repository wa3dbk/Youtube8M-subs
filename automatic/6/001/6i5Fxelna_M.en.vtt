00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.410 
you need the supplier to pay particular
attention<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.290> once<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.910> production<00:03:24.330> is

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
attention to and once the production is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.060 
attention to and once the production is
done<00:03:24.600> obviously<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:25.290> they<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.650> tick<00:03:25.890> off

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
done obviously then they can tick off

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.220 
done obviously then they can tick off
each<00:03:26.340> loss<00:03:26.670> section<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> say<00:03:27.330> they've<00:03:27.600> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
each loss section to say they've you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.930 
each loss section to say they've you
know<00:03:28.350> done<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.830> part<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.400> certain<00:03:29.730> part

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
know done that part that certain part

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.960 
know done that part that certain part

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
that you requested this then means you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.730 
that you requested this then means you
can<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:33.240> move<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.570> from<00:03:33.750> there<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.710> to

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
can then move on from there on to

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.710

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
customs clearance I've also just

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.820 
customs clearance I've also just
included<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> timeline<00:03:40.080> here<00:03:40.320> for<00:03:40.500> everyone

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
included a timeline here for everyone

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.560 
included a timeline here for everyone
this<00:03:41.220> will<00:03:41.400> give<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.850> idea<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.209> how<00:03:42.390> long

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
this will give you an idea of how long

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.210 
this will give you an idea of how long
it<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:42.780> takes<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.800> initial

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
it actually takes from the initial

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.160 
it actually takes from the initial
research<00:03:44.459> stage<00:03:45.030> through<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.660> getting<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
research stage through to getting the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.230 
research stage through to getting the
products<00:03:46.560> delivered<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.070> your<00:03:47.220> door<00:03:47.400> and

products delivered to your door and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.300 
products delivered to your door and
normally<00:03:48.600> for<00:03:48.780> us<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.470> around<00:03:49.740> four<00:03:49.980> months

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
normally for us it's around four months

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.330 
normally for us it's around four months
this<00:03:50.880> obviously<00:03:51.540> depends<00:03:52.080> on<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.920> size<00:03:53.160> of

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
this obviously depends on the size of

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.620 
this obviously depends on the size of
the<00:03:53.430> project<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> amount<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.209> production

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
the project the amount of production

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690 
the project the amount of production
involved<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.709> strength<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> supplier<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
involved the strength of the supplier to

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.510 
involved the strength of the supplier to
do<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.209> quickly<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:58.230> stuff<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.430> if

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
do it quickly and stuff like that but if

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.100 
do it quickly and stuff like that but if
a<00:03:59.550> rough<00:04:00.060> guideline<00:04:00.450> would<00:04:00.570> help<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> lot

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110
