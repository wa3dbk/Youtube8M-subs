00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.250
 so hello everyone and now i will show you 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.420
 Lego konfetnitsu on not knows and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.000
 Lego candy if machine for candy 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.330
 most likely a candy machine I wanted 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.300
 to do that here, this is a button, as it were, and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 us until you throw a coin but I do 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.769
 I did not think of it when I thought of it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.080
 so let's see first see what 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.410
 this is how it works from is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.590
 top button is like how to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.620
 petrichko where the balls when 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.440
 put or candy round necessarily 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.629
 he is ten so polished 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.879
 where are they all here on rolling out so 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.450
 we left it so easy decoration i don't 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.629
 so many different parts this is why they 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.399
 I have a little bit like that here 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 side behind it all covered well here and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 there is such an open thing here two 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 holes just to be there slightly 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 holy was 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 here and here I show you how she 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.630
 it works right there on top of the balls look 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 Here we take a button, we clicked out 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 the ball until the next to make it work 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 it is necessary here on the ball to the end usually 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 rolls out took free drew off 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.020
 have to sharply listen to this bam is ours 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.130
 the ball fell continue even tons here it is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 the second was pulled 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 And now let me show you how to have that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.210
 there inside where he rolls out at all 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 reduce the delay 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.170
 So he rolled rolled rolled away all 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.320
 This is all I have until it holds only 5 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.509
 balls so now I will show her as well 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 principle to build them build 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 easy case for the start of construction at 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.140
 me such a removable top cover which 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.170
 I have now a little on 2 poured 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.740
 I had all collapsed quarrel Now 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.740
 one second 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.590
 so so here I have disassembled the roof and so 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.830
 look at me too mess in principle how 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.010
 would look so here is a place where you are 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.110
 add up the balls will be here is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.500
 the mechanism is this button inside it 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 It looks like this 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.100
 Here is such a black thing to back 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:43.580
 I didnâ€™t take the ball 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.430
 he is here so that the balls themselves 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.830
 by itself did not roll out if such 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.209
 the thing is scared when you press 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.820
 on the button you move it 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.730
 peas me now both doors skopin 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.600
 therefore he became that is, it is generally 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.459
 looks like when i found this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.860
 but here you have already understood 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.959
 track must it be from 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.650
 smooth details at night roll out boom 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:17.660
 boom and so here we are now 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.180
 show you what she looks like when my 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:35.560
 refuel we refuel her fall 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:39.040
 the balls are strengthened, look, it will break out 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.840
 autofocus that's watching 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.090
 since we make the ball in response fell and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.799
 stand before this bu grammar we 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.269
 we push Odessa wall as you see it 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.269
 so he flew away 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.549
 Here he grew up see if smooth 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.549
 the movement must be drastically 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.310
 Well, this is how the parade also know 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.239
 Sold machines for 5 rubles such 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.600
 round pupils in principle they can be well 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.900
 Here is such in principle konfetnitsy cool 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.800
 I built it for a long time how to build there 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.260
 poured, too, on the Internet, in principle, everything 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.070
 all while you were Stepan 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.070
 goodbye
