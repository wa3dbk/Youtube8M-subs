together<00:02:09.200> all<00:02:09.769> we<00:02:10.099> have<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.399> do<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:10.700> allow<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
together all we have to do is allow the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.660 
together all we have to do is allow the
mixture<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.690> partially<00:02:12.560> set<00:02:12.769> up<00:02:12.890> either<00:02:13.370> at

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
mixture to partially set up either at

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.369 
mixture to partially set up either at

room temperature or in the fridge to

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.530 
room temperature or in the fridge to
speed<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> process<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> basically<00:02:17.360> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
speed up the process and basically you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.750 
speed up the process and basically you
want<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.989> begin<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.709> harden<00:02:19.159> but<00:02:19.610> you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
want it to begin the harden but you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.149 
want it to begin the harden but you
still<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.540> remain<00:02:21.019> soft<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.860> pliable

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
still want it to remain soft and pliable

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.280 
still want it to remain soft and pliable
and<00:02:22.760> I'll<00:02:23.030> show<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.420> consistency<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and I'll show you the consistency that I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.970 
and I'll show you the consistency that I
come<00:02:24.590> up<00:02:24.769> with<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.280> little<00:02:25.549> while

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
come up with in a little while

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.920 
come up with in a little while
here<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.340> texture<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.849> my<00:02:29.030> partially

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
here is the texture of my partially

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.069 
here is the texture of my partially
solidified<00:02:30.230> oils<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.519> still<00:02:31.940> very<00:02:32.209> soft<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
solidified oils it's still very soft so

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.960 
solidified oils it's still very soft so
when<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> put<00:02:33.470> my<00:02:33.500> finger<00:02:33.650> into<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.549> indents

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
when I put my finger into it and indents

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.819 
when I put my finger into it and indents
but<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.480> soft<00:02:35.780> enough<00:02:36.049> for<00:02:36.110> me<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.620> able

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
but it's soft enough for me to be able

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.420 
but it's soft enough for me to be able
to<00:02:37.190> impress<00:02:37.670> upon<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:39.140> scoopable<00:02:39.860> and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
to impress upon it so it's scoopable and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.130 
to impress upon it so it's scoopable and
you<00:02:40.610> basically<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.120> need<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.599> texture<00:02:42.019> to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
you basically just need the texture to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.869 
you basically just need the texture to
be<00:02:42.170> something<00:02:42.680> that's<00:02:42.859> a<00:02:43.040> whipple

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
be something that's a whipple

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.580 
be something that's a whipple
consistency<00:02:44.720> because<00:02:44.900> essentially<00:02:45.530> that's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
consistency because essentially that's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.259 
consistency because essentially that's
what<00:02:45.769> we're<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.579> we're<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.150> to

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.170 
what we're going to do we're going to
scoop<00:02:47.750> all<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.010> put<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.549> into<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.849> bowl

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
scoop all this up and put it into a bowl

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.569 
scoop all this up and put it into a bowl
and<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:51.019> either<00:02:51.230> use<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> stand<00:02:52.040> mixer<00:02:52.129> to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
and you can either use a stand mixer to

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.670 
and you can either use a stand mixer to
allow<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.239> all<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.569> work<00:02:53.750> for<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.260> or

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
allow it to do all the work for you or

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.349 
allow it to do all the work for you or
you<00:02:54.739> can<00:02:54.799> use<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> hand<00:02:55.340> mixer<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.849> essentially

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
you can use a hand mixer and essentially

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.940 
you can use a hand mixer and essentially
we're<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.810> whip<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.290> up<00:02:57.379> until<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.829> gets

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
we're going to whip it up until it gets

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.150 
we're going to whip it up until it gets
fluffy

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.070 

you

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.710 

so<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.130> are<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:17.940> long<00:03:18.210> as<00:03:18.240> your<00:03:18.570> house

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
so here we are and as long as your house

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.480 
so here we are and as long as your house
doesn't<00:03:19.020> exceed<00:03:19.500> about<00:03:19.770> seventy-five

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
doesn't exceed about seventy-five

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.940 
doesn't exceed about seventy-five
degrees<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:21.180> should<00:03:21.750> stay<00:03:22.020> just<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.650> this

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
degrees it should stay just like this

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.070 
degrees it should stay just like this
soft<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.490> spreadable<00:03:24.000> at<00:03:24.180> room<00:03:24.420> temperature

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
soft and spreadable at room temperature

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.470 
soft and spreadable at room temperature
so<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.010> does<00:03:26.220> start<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.580> melt<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.270> read

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
so if it does start to melt you can read

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.570 
so if it does start to melt you can read
with<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.110> same<00:03:28.380> consistency<00:03:29.070> or<00:03:29.460> you

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
with it for that same consistency or you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.280 
with it for that same consistency or you
can<00:03:29.700> pop<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.060> back<00:03:30.090> into<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.690> refrigerator<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
can pop it back into the refrigerator to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.110 
can pop it back into the refrigerator to
chill<00:03:31.320> for<00:03:31.560> just<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.040> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:33.000> don't

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
chill for just a little bit you don't

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.360 
chill for just a little bit you don't
want<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.390> store<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:35.070> will

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
want to store it in there and it will

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.120 
want to store it in there and it will
melt<00:03:35.700> at<00:03:36.030> your<00:03:36.300> fingers<00:03:36.780> touch<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.650> just

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
melt at your fingers touch it's just

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.150 
melt at your fingers touch it's just
like<00:03:38.730> butter<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.020> glides<00:03:40.440> right<00:03:40.950> in

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
like butter and it just glides right in

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.180 
like butter and it just glides right in
and<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.850> love<00:03:42.210> how<00:03:42.450> comforting<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.200> feels<00:03:43.590> your

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and I love how comforting it feels your

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.780 
and I love how comforting it feels your
skin<00:03:44.520> just<00:03:44.670> drinks<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.300> up<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.200> luxurious

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
skin just drinks it up it's so luxurious
