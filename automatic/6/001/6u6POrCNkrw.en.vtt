00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
replacing a Kang a crank position sensor

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.190 
replacing a Kang a crank position sensor
on<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> 2005<00:00:10.139> Dodge<00:00:10.469> Ram<00:00:10.889> 1500<00:00:11.490> pickup<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.750> I've

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
bit so I'm also actually going to do two

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.609 
bit so I'm also actually going to do two
videos<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:22.380> I've<00:00:22.500> been<00:00:22.619> told<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> p0<00:00:24.720> 3<00:00:25.170> 3

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
videos because I've been told the p0 3 3

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.130 
videos because I've been told the p0 3 3
5<00:00:25.800> code<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:27.029> originate<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.570> either<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
5 code can originate from either the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.720 
5 code can originate from either the
crank<00:00:28.380> position<00:00:28.740> sensor<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> cam

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
crank position sensor or the cam

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
crank position sensor or the cam
position<00:00:30.210> sensor<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> replace

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
position sensor so I'm going to replace

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
position sensor so I'm going to replace
both<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.940> show<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> where

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
they are what they look like how you get

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.280 
they are what they look like how you get
to<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.840> took<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.110> while

to them because it took a little while
to<00:00:37.350> figure<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.219> figure<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> video

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to figure this out so I figure a video

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.270 
to figure this out so I figure a video
might<00:00:38.940> help<00:00:38.969> let<00:00:39.750> me<00:00:39.809> switch<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> view<00:00:40.440> here

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.970

here<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:51.149> new<00:00:51.300> sensor<00:00:52.219> it's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> three<00:00:53.550> pin

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
here is the new sensor it's a three pin

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.180 
here is the new sensor it's a three pin
latch<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> side<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.449> single<00:00:57.449> bolt<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
latch on the side a single bolt which is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.250 
latch on the side a single bolt which is
a<00:00:59.219> 10<00:00:59.579> millimeter<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:01.559> don<00:01:01.710> thing<00:01:02.039> goes

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
a 10 millimeter and the don thing goes

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.039 
a 10 millimeter and the don thing goes
right<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> okay<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.390> rear

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

insert that in the hole put the 10

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.630 
insert that in the hole put the 10
millimeter<00:01:15.930> bolt<00:01:16.229> through<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.590> connect<00:01:17.490> up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
millimeter bolt through it connect up

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
millimeter bolt through it connect up
the<00:01:17.759> cannon<00:01:18.090> plug<00:01:18.299> cannon<00:01:18.900> plug<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> little

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the cannon plug cannon plug is a little

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
the cannon plug cannon plug is a little
challenging<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> lock<00:01:20.790> tab<00:01:21.150> on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
challenging because it has a lock tab on

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
challenging because it has a lock tab on
it<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.890> ate<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it and they and then they ate a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.789 
it and they and then they ate a
depressed<00:01:24.000> tab<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:25.080> actually<00:01:25.320> two<00:01:25.500> tabs

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
depressed tab there's actually two tabs

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
depressed tab there's actually two tabs
to<00:01:26.070> take<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:27.509> I'll<00:01:27.900> drop<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.350> here

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to take off and I'll drop it down here

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
okay the red tab has to be lifted up and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
okay the red tab has to be lifted up and
then<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.560> button<00:01:37.829> toward<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.390> to

it up again and then I'm going to make a

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.649 
it up again and then I'm going to make a
video<00:01:58.859> for<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.520> other<00:01:59.700> sensor<00:02:00.240> hope<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> helps
