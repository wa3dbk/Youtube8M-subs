 Let me explain a little bit more , I really thought this was my first time . 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 Even in the world there are so many examples 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:25.960
 That wonderful project is this professional orchestra 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.320
 It is that it is raising the conductor the process that later 9 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 Say with us to cooperate really that 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.509
 rare 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:44.809
 Though you that navy blue black Attari handle from before about I mean 2330 years old the old days I also 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.620
 It says Datte Tangle By the way, while teaching that orchestra there also young conductor at that time 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.950
 But when it gets cold 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 That's probably because the room is a student's cherry case 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.500
 I was doing there is that I also teach the same at 8 o'clock conductor in purpose is to teach a large Ketsura

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.449
