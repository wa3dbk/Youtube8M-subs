of<00:00:59.980> people<00:01:00.190> have<00:01:00.370> them<00:01:00.550> not<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.570> much<00:01:01.629> the

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
of people have them not so much the

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.880 
of people have them not so much the
Pixies<00:01:02.289> but<00:01:03.030> definitely<00:01:04.030> pac-man<00:01:04.420> frogs<00:01:04.890> so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
Pixies but definitely pac-man frogs so

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.140 
Pixies but definitely pac-man frogs so

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
here's the difference so this guy is a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.969 
here's the difference so this guy is a
full-grown<00:01:10.000> pretty<00:01:10.659> much<00:01:10.869> he'll<00:01:11.560> maybe<00:01:11.740> get<00:01:11.950> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
full-grown pretty much he'll maybe get a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.310 
full-grown pretty much he'll maybe get a
little<00:01:12.220> bit<00:01:12.340> fatter<00:01:12.549> if<00:01:12.820> that's<00:01:13.030> possible<00:01:13.630> but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
little bit fatter if that's possible but

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.230 
little bit fatter if that's possible but
I<00:01:14.530> believe<00:01:14.890> he's<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.040> male<00:01:15.250> also<00:01:15.490> African

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
I believe he's a male also African

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.780 
I believe he's a male also African
bullfrog<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:17.020> this<00:01:17.890> right<00:01:18.280> here<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.520> my

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
bullfrog and this right here is my

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.990 
bullfrog and this right here is my
pac-man<00:01:19.659> frog<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.799> I<00:01:20.860> have<00:01:21.070> had<00:01:21.280> Believe<00:01:21.909> It

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
pac-man frog that I have had Believe It

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.910 
pac-man frog that I have had Believe It
or<00:01:22.090> Not<00:01:22.119> for<00:01:22.630> eight<00:01:22.840> years<00:01:22.869> now<00:01:23.350> I've<00:01:23.590> had<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
guy for a long time he um he goes

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.130 
guy for a long time he um he goes
through<00:01:27.729> cycles<00:01:28.180> he'll<00:01:28.360> actually<00:01:28.720> not<00:01:28.869> eat

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
through cycles he'll actually not eat

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.940 
through cycles he'll actually not eat
for<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.409> couple<00:01:29.680> months<00:01:29.829> and<00:01:30.100> then<00:01:30.250> he'll<00:01:31.119> eat

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
for a couple months and then he'll eat

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.340 
for a couple months and then he'll eat
so<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:34.000> look<00:01:34.329> at<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.509> difference<00:01:34.899> look<00:01:35.140> at

the difference this guy you can't even
see<00:02:07.600> my<00:02:07.719> hand<00:02:07.930> when<00:02:08.050> he's<00:02:08.170> on<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.470> he's<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> beast

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
see my hand when he's on it he's a beast

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030 
see my hand when he's on it he's a beast
so<00:02:12.000> obviously<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:14.350> difference<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:14.830> you're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
so obviously the difference is you're

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.890 
so obviously the difference is you're
gonna<00:02:15.130> need<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.610> bigger<00:02:15.970> cage<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.570> these<00:02:16.720> guys

supply<00:02:21.330> more<00:02:22.330> food<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:23.260> you're<00:02:23.410> gonna<00:02:23.500> keep

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
supply more food if you're gonna keep
