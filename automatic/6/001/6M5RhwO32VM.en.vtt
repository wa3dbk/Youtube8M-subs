00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 echo function unboxing of the bell 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.350
 exceptional bell to primary we see 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.630
 perhaps what is it that we arrive home 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 made the import of this article 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 He liked so much and then I did it I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.599
 import fact 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.279
 okay then always without just like 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.830
 a trumpet we see the water and it is here 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 there is the attack below we see it as it has 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 made the attack this the bell with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.689
 the rella line and then the little button and then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 what will go on the bicycle first 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.610
 what to do there to open the there from 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.920
 open the center we find the battery ag 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.570
 the battery pack is also included 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 including included 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 then it's a flaw it was to do yes also 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 because I put even if the inert 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.920
 site I did not do a small area that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 then I liked the opposite 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.899
 bell at a low price to the public 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 7 the omitted to the public 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 this article here we consider that the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.129
 battery is so from turin to this one 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.500
 leaves little clamor to very easy 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 halloween and out this is exact note 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 then the healthy one with the tweezers yes 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.860
 it takes away when it is time for the word 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.119
 beat 5 is a pile of those 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.420
 rectangular new optics has happened 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:19.280
 so then it sounds loud and if you are 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 done put a beautiful girl photo 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.340
 speaks the periphery gag law 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.340
 normal normal 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.270
 and really strong works and keys one 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.240
 defense and now we are at this point 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.870
 with this sound when we press them 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.250
 late evening late one hundred I always play 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:52.240
 let's stop here for you it will always be the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.070
 my friend then pretty much every time 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 that press there is a different sound then 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.520
 it is not boring as sound is also 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.160
 fun for the around making caciara 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.170
 sets considered to put two for bikes 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.300
 2 per pc which also omitted the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.119
 stroller behind and my son heaven 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.950
 in front and then buy them maybe group 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.780
 buy in the group of friends like that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.690
 you save on shipping costs is 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.700
 written are sound alarms if the sounds of the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.380
 many different sounds if the sounds 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 then then we'll show you now 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.540
 also how to attach it on the bicycle 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.970
 so we will also do the tutorial of how 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.640
 attacked we throw away salvecchio 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.920
 bed bells and that ridiculous device 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.050
 here you are not worth anything but in the midst of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 traffic can be heard 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:46.720
 cars if you go to 30 per hour if well 25 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:50.070
 then a little the difference is I would say that 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.130
 there is a bit of difference in the center at 0 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.440
 let's go and position this 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.780
 so inside but you already put it no 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.090
 for a moment I support him to see how 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.010
 they put the lost break is after it was 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 there contrade that you should not be mistaken once 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.340
 no verse we are going to enlarge 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.720
 then we go to enlarge it e 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.040
 put on we put the commini we put the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.140
 rubber pads one and two companies in the thick 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.570
 last rubber must be do 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.820
 now it makes it empty now not when 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.920
 you put the trumpet on it brown 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.290
 now it was with the trumpet you can 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.630
 force maybe on plastic and force 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.269
 then it creates damage then the rotation 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.449
 it must be done now it is only now 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.139
 put the trumpet once put the 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.239
 trumpet 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.010
 take by deciding where to put it 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.900
 You can really put so many points on us 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.639
 here we look reinforces here is there 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.609
 a possibility to insert it in here 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.160
 go sure you don't then don't 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.090
 we know that new I don't know from 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.130
 pleasant puts clearly in the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.070
 no handle this maybe who I was moving 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.250
 what counts is the on-board computer a little more 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.650
 as I put it here maybe I didn't find the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.060
 so maybe with a cable tie 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.650
 a clamp that he held because otherwise 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.790
 here it was a little too large to put it here 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.010
 to this mammina here of aluminum that yes 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.750
 suitable is given to the narrow minus the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.660
 lamina be attacked by so to do 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.970
 this this way we fold 18 but from 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.760
 somewhere so that it has disappeared 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:33.520
 gazette if they ever did 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:36.840
 fold I see with force ends fit 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.580
 very well ok this does not move anymore 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.760
 they died then after the thread one maybe 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.220
 it also makes it disappear in any 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.930
 point there are so many possibilities then or 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.270
 use the pitina we don't have 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.760
 used in this case are put 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.800
 a clamp or I found the way to 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.840
 adapt it to your bicycle based 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.820
 where it is most convenient premier it is 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.190
 done in a way that is good on all 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.030
 bicilette here in the end that you do but wi 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.490
 fi on the bell 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.470
 yes because if i want to shorten for not 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.479
 to show the thread I do a thing yes 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:14.830
 senato ok let's do some laps here 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.900
 done and now the wire did not 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.790
 I always do the most perfect treaty 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.400
 with care and if such operation 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.560
 that you do not burn 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.460
 do not contact the bell 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.259
 never jerk the same thing here not 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.539
 rotate now if I want to pull it 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.030
 upwards I don't have to rotate so I have to 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.789
 remove the bell I have to remove the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.430
 doorbell and move this move 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.370
 this is because if not, why not go p 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.860
 that we do strength where it does not go 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.490
 forced I see this way the way 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.979
 correct very serious type I drive for 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:56.260
 for in case of danger 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:59.060
 just remember a finger and lucie 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.400
 doorbells are devices that there 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.410
 they have to stand on bicycles 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.270
 because if you are on the road you need to 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.270
 of facts to see made to hear
