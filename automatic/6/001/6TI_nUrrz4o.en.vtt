00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 channel videos of alba marquez then in 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.610
 this time I come to teach how to do 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 nothing rope to assault this 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.309
 very practical and very practical show 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.559
 and no, and I use it in the gym in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.299
 when between practical box is one of the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.590
 of the exercises that help us 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.710
 A lot to grasp strengthen the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 legs and in the hands then this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 I want you to follow me with this simple 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.690
 this instructions so that I 'm going to in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 this seat 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.220
 they're going to put this what we're going to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.460
 need would be two yogurt pots like 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.130
 this one term of mkt more or less than three 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 meters by cable as you want and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:47.100
 a scissors the next plus the hole 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.070
 in the bottom of the pot and we put 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:57.650
 what it is 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:01:03.010
 the rope was passed on the other side and 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.010
 here we make a small dip 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.260
 from the other end 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.930
 we grab the other from the other boat 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 until it passes the other side as it happened 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 in this way it would be our memory 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 and steve reich like that would be then 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.670
 now now I'm going to tell you how they can 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.670
 jump the iss and you lose it 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.740
 good friends well like that way 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 our rope was left 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 I hope the video that you liked is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.560
 something very fast and easy to do and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.240
 creanme can do with a bit of a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.180
 a little thicker rope so that the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 moment that wants to be heavier and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.670
 can make the movement faster 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.369
 then this is very easy to do and it is 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.540
 of this is my pregnancy then this 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.910
 I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 let's share friends I bless you and be 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.340
