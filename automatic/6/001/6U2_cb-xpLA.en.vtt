00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi people i have some news 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 for you or is a small one 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.360
 Announcement and indeed we have determined 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.980
 already many of you have heard about 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.230
 the mambo page that is coming soon 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 will give a book about us 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 I wanted you an easy 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
 a little something to tell because I just 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 could not write everything and that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.460
 would have been too much and just there 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 many have asked and yes all the more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 few questions just to clarify 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.310
 I'll tell you now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
 little thing has started over it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.439
 all this then on the equitana this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 year 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 we were there at the riding sport newsstand 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 and right next to me was patmos 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.079
 verlag and they have us then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.340
 addressed and the card plugged 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 have meant who times thereafter 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 can come and I have 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.590
 then we made it then over it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.350
 gone and they just meant 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 it 's all a little bit now 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 have followed and a little bit 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.820
 have just informed us about it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.530
 what to write about us want to be 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390
 So roughly agreed that we stop us 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.680
 think twice and so little ourselves 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.420
 First inform because I had like 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 said no idea of something and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.300
 Of course, first of all it was full 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 Surprised which never thought 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.360
 definitely went all in from a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.909
 the next day we have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 starting with different meetings 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 phone calls and then with 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 photo shoots for the book the photo shoot 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.380
 then we have together with alexandra 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 Ivan, I'll do that for you, of course 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 also to everything that will tell now I will 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 put you different links infobox 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 away and get to the book so in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 the book is mainly about ours 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 story in a book says mine 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.409
 my teacher and the family 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.630
 The previous owner was too mambo to me 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.740
 our story about everything in the book 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 actually stands from front to back 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.079
 everything in there about us and also one 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 few tips and tricks for everyday life and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.020
 just as we partially do these tricks 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.920
 you have taught everything there 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.990
 a little something in it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 in the book are also very many 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 Pictures are from our whole time and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 from different photoshootings to the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 example now the alexandra manuel 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.719
 schmid with the children yes from the ski with 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 all of that a bit too 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.070
 Variety is in it and that's nice 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.329
 is designed and I sit up 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.979
 the case is already very cool 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.420
 I have no idea how 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770
 the book will look like it or on the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.709
 The End 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.450
 completely finished then I will be there 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.310
 I do not know and am myself 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.930
 also totally excited because I am yes 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.400
 Something complete for me 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.519
 new is yes I would never have it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.129
 thought or expected I'll say that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.599
 you will give book about us and come 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.890
 at the beginning do not imagine it at all 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.080
 so probably I have the same thing 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.610
 reacts like a few of you hear that way 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.549
 most want to write something now 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.010
 totally normal for me just yet, it is 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.480
 up my life should I times since am 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.400
 I just totally curious how it is 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.170
 and I'm really looking forward to it 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.910
 the book appears as i said 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 september you can stop it now 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.400
 reserve 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.140
 I'll tell you all then as I said 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.599
 put possible left into infobox 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.269
 So to the campus publishes itself 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.459
 facebook page to book orders for 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.739
 to the photographers to the different ones 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.430
 and yes you can just enter it yourself 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.829
 look a bit 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.920
 I also have many comments 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.000
 read or noticed because I am yes 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.380
 not in these groups in there where that 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.579
 is written and becomes me personally 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.579
 such a thing is not written god 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.079
 Thanks, I already have such comments 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.150
 read by because 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.139
 why do you write somebody and book 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.780
 everything here so I did not even have a 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.739
 high grades or whatever i can 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.180
 but on the other hand stand for it 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.790
 on the other hand, that says yes 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.799
 For example, I do not think that we 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.269
 are totally special or what 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.709
 extraordinary or whatever 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.340
 me is our stories of course 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.470
 very special and I am happy 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.730
 Of course, that mega anyway about that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.440
 book here is no longer the story 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.700
 can live again and again and me 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.130
 I am also happy who this offer 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.650
 would reject a separate book about 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.230
 to have his and his horse over the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.840
 whole story and with all the heights and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.340
 deep and I do not think that 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.440
 any of you maybe something 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.790
 Jobs has attributed when he does that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.560
 would get the offer itself 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.819
 would refuse brand on his that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.930
 Some people wanted to read me through them 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.180
 everything is not interested 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.069
 he can force this topic and nothing else 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.510
 There are many of these too 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.950
 totally looking forward and already 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.769
 have said that we have the first book which 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.269
 read it completely and otherwise it was 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.069
 Of course, I am all the more pleased, yes, me 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.859
 just think so again 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.750
 read how everything has expired 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.350
 with all the highs and lows which partly 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.700
 also not on the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.980
 So today was I think that is 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.050
 Really for me personally anyway totally 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.970
 what's really cool and cool 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.230
 special and that has always been me 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.910
 can read through again 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.040
 and yes , as I said no one with 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.620
 forced to buy that to buy 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.570
 However , not everyone has to do something 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.100
 although I do not say so 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.330
 believe that rejects any 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.700
 would this offer because it stops 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.410
 just what a chance you get 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.030
 never again, yes, we hope so too 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.290
 that you liked the video and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.970
 will just say until the next 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.970
 video and do it well
