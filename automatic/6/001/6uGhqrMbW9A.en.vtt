00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.990
 or not 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.240
 today we are here releasing the new 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.090
 chevrolet cobalt now a release 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.000
 more than this year of so many releases 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.490
 that we have had about cobalt is a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.220
 medium vehicle and has oriented it 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.199
 mainly the family we present it 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.689
 today to the specialized press 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.530
 in the plant where we are 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.530
 producing movies 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 and we show the presses for the first time 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 and stamp the bands since the years 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.080
 I would tell you that this can not be defined 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 as the vehicle designed for 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.079
 person who wants 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.790
 a large space inside the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.450
 large robust large vehicle 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.670
 with a great height on a floor with a 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.180
 very good engine very well balanced that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.190
 achieves a torque at very low revolutions 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.070
 excellent so many low revolutions and 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.950
 with a very good gasoline consumption but 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.290
 but above all great space both 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.960
 inside the passenger compartment as in 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.960
 the trunk where technically 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.440
 great regards to all the followers 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.390
 of f1latam all the followers the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.050
 cool fans to join us 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.940
 here in this new release that what 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.850
 unique that presents is new 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.220
 alternatives and the search to have 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.830
 always the client stylists you 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.770
 very well thank you very much to all by car 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.900
 the tam met today enjoyed a 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.970
 exceptional driving test on a circuit 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.070
 supremely stuck because we know that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.600
 the cobalt has some things that do not have 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.020
 other vehicles in the segment 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 first is a comfortable versatile car and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.920
 dynamic what does that mean the chassis 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.690
 it is very well calculated the senses in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.000
 this circuit have locked those curves 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.770
 moves is very well calculated the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.350
 suspension and very well made 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.210
 exchange relations to recover to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.640
 she takes us to the theme of powertrain 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.670
 that is propelling to be the cobat 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.010
 It has a traditional 1.8-liter engine 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.630
 104 horsepower but with a 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 high degree of torque is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.790
 important 14 forgiveness 16.4 kilograms 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.690
 meters that's enough for the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.000
 1.8 engine and we have a relationship 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.590
 of box that helps you get the most 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.900
 profit to that 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.610
 in other words you there when 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.740
 have a test and a dealer 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.480
 chevrolet take one test and leave 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.640
 to realize that they recover any 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.220
 change that we are working 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.810
 to make it fun to drive for 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.520
 that in the city can go out to a 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.680
 corner crosses something not in a change 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.420
 anybody and the action car that's 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.660
 what these eight engines have 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.700
 valves is that you have a lot of dose of 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.530
 torque down 90 percent of the torque 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 it has it at 2,500 revolutions then 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.209
 we have a machine that is familiar 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.400
 can move all the quota the size of the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.450
 vehicle perfectly and that's what 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.410
 we saw today in state 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.020
 three strong points of bedrooms 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.000
 the first one that is magnificent for me is 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.310
 the calibration of suspensions the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.890
 suspension in general not only that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.480
 does not transmit noise and generates a car 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450
 compact but it's very good 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.200
 calculated neither too hard nor too loose 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.020
 perfect for a second family car 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.990
 the fantastic space driving the 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.180
 back of the trunk 563 liters much 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.489
 more than higher categories and the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.310
 last is a chevrolet diese bowtie 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.290
 here in front makes me have a whole 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.480
 backup world backup should be 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.760
 all things offered by chÃ©vere 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.120
 I invite you to try a kid with 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.790
 very well in f1latam to all those who 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.130
 are attentive in this segment in the 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.440
 automotive sector thank you very much for 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.840
 stay tuned and we'll see you hopefully 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.170
 more news soon thank you very much 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.170
 to all
