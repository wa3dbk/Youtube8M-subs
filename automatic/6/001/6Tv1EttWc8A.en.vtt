 and initially had on the iPhone 4 iPhone 3gs 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.039
 a stalemate 1 EBIT is therefore not yet over 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.039
 iPod Touch to the third generation generation we have 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.359
 and spirals the iPhone 4 against 4 hours but not now 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.019
 know which come from 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.229
 and yes we can see 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.489
 I am with my iPhone 4 on which everything gives to be 3 points 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.130
 and yes 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.880

 you're turning to the page here 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.479
 right after that to Felix Bruns point website something equal four times right 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.400
 the page will still be in my description 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.720
 and then you can just write here to Albert Ott Herbst or iPhone 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.690
 choose four models today 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.510
 and Udo current year Messiah nature 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.490
 and on the other hand that is the beast that is allowed to block in the earth 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.660
 download for Petzner and 059 points 6 RC 14 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.250
 That may be there for a bed of x and windows 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.180
 so then just click on it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.250
 one at the Anger Oderland on any and so on and yes 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.120
 so that's better tolerated now 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.730
 then we have these two files a new one again our four men 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.670
 and what can be done is expensive 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.740
 connect a white one 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.150
 and 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 The travel time is simply higher than normal 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.170
 unit-it's departure 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.770
 then he looks for your 4 MEUR which I have on the desktop so hers 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.440
 Miser 6 0 put more tires already bad 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 Hamburg by much 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.940
 Seduce Egeler and 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.500
 so told 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.690
 and soon Dario Saxe's freeride escapes 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.979
 then he goes to next CDs Halle percent not squeezed 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.269
 Reason Dr 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:21.039
 as well we have a few options here which of course everyone 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.939
 Making a case is the most important thing 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.079
 until you change to the proud as the train path because without them that would be safe 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.219
 we are not missing there 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.929
 all the more then is gross change of the yesterday from the 9 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.569
 In order to then emergency people with Halo Putin people you can 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.229
 in the box well praise set for your device but itself 1 ums paint signs 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.209
 paints or simply any documentation from the point of view of their sound 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.169
 to adjust 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.999
 as far as the boat Hedderich Breitnau 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.359
 Kramme the Las the simple test that the mountain lives per cent the R &amp; D the Mood 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.909
 for now let you too 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.230
 such a single one on Macs and now SW rose 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.200
 Controversial statements about mild white bread even when Plack stand 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 So turn it off completely 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.289
 So it must be completely switched off as I said 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.310
 so and as I said actually they had one set 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.170
 exactly 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.970
 so now it is the next step that was very important to us 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.809
 now this ring renounces the f-youth 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.329
 Carsten acting in office 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.540
 Keegan East was a sprinkling three seconds on the main market 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.190
 takes 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.050
 then the ten seconds passed on the home button and athletes are is with it 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.219
 Keep the minus key pressed down 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.379
 and then let go of the trailer and continue the home button 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.629
 I'll get that richer 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.089
 So Mexx and wait now 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.829
 who has been with Paul for three seconds 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.209
 then wait ten seconds for Rome then to wait 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.759
 and let as a printed leave without Glos 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.439
 and now we let go of the trailer and keep turning 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.989
 Hohmann pressed 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.969
 said the cdu politician at the Volk percent exploit in Rosenheim 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:24.599
 well done for the champion team have nice weather outside Bonn and 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.529
 Now he gets this around because only the Ninja Bregtäler 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.120
 Sony's seen as our one white commandment 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.700
 so lock in time 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.569
 and that's what it looks like 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.159
 now 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.319
 8, SCA mirrored terms, had nothing 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.940
 it's just time today 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.009
 and searched for four years 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.919
 or yes that's exactly what they are from both sides 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.199
 we could see 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.569
 it just sounds like it does not scare two pages like Twitter 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.569
 the restoration of Victor around 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.680
 with together standard 13 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 be occupied 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.000
 You've got some of you know Jeff Burton successfully 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.710
 in the last five he plays himself 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.069
 so and that too from me now 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.239
 I hope that the new right and commented before others 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.379
 rated alarmed wants own facebook fanpage Volkmer Fürther and such 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.270
 continue 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.550
 I hope to see you again in a Video Solutions SIS in a video 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.370
