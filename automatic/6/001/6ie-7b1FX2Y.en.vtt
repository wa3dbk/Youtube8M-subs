00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.979 
and I've said that to him you know and
even<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> last<00:02:23.819> game<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.300> went<00:02:24.720> through<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
even the last game I went through the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.420 
even the last game I went through the
video<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.410> line<00:02:25.590> played<00:02:25.860> pretty<00:02:26.099> darn<00:02:26.370> good

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
video that line played pretty darn good

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.660 
video that line played pretty darn good
for<00:02:26.610> their<00:02:27.000> four<00:02:27.239> or<00:02:27.330> five<00:02:27.510> minutes<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.220> see

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
for their four or five minutes and I see

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.100 
for their four or five minutes and I see
him<00:02:29.760> playing<00:02:30.000> more<00:02:30.360> when<00:02:30.569> he's<00:02:30.690> playing<00:02:30.840> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
him playing more when he's playing I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.150 
him playing more when he's playing I
don't<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.440> him<00:02:31.530> being<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.830> four<00:02:32.069> or

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
don't see him being a four or

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.690 
don't see him being a four or
five-minute<00:02:32.340> guy<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:34.370> think<00:02:35.370> it'll<00:02:35.489> just

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
five-minute guy but I think it'll just

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.699 
five-minute guy but I think it'll just
depend<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.239> game<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> scenario

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
depend on the game and what the scenario

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.949 
depend on the game and what the scenario
is<00:02:37.860> how<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.790> decide<00:02:39.060> who<00:02:39.120> gets<00:02:39.420> called<00:02:39.810> up

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
is how do you decide who gets called up

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
is how do you decide who gets called up
what's<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.830> process<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:44.819> know<00:02:44.940> we

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
what's that process like you know we

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
what's that process like you know we
talked<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.480> Travis<00:02:46.200> Greene<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.829> see
