00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.950
 good and welcome to tasting cante 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.299
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.520
 video in which we are going to review 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.469
 enough changes and important news 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.600
 as for example the elimination by the 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.300
 time to water night hunter 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.190
 pv server to improve the skin too 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.750
 we will talk about rumble if you will receive a 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.120
 visual improvement or not and about what 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.800
 we can see in the next patch 4.5 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.960
 everything that is to come and a small 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.370
 debate about the next champion already 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.480
 you know that you can use the wand of 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.010
 up to navigate through the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.690
 news that you are most interested in doing 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.180
 click on the annotation so let's 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.070
 start by reign last night in 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.870
 server update pp was removed 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.789
 the skin of reign as commented 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.219
 it requires working hard on them 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.839
 thanks to community advice and it's 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.670
 true that the truth is that the corner 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.769
 meaning to many people about 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.999
 all the followers of this champion yes 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.940
 It's true that I do not dislike the 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.440
 skin but I expected something more for a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.030
 third is fifth reinhart 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.339
 considering that he had not left 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.769
 none of him I think I expected a 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.780
 little bit more but well I want to give 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.220
 a different touch for now I do not think that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.020
 see it in the next patch of 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.180
 all forms any thing or any 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.130
 news information do not worry 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.289
 because we will see it 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.180
 the videos what it seems is that the 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.939
 rewalk accrue if it is going to be carried out 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.380
 in patch 4.5 but we'll see that in 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.810
 the latest news of the video now 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.130
 let's talk about the good rambert 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.170
 you already know that rumble has received a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.789
 legendary skin called rappel super 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.049
 galactic and if you have not seen it 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.270
 I leave a link in the description for 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.829
 that you see more carefully the skin what 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.360
 that we all thought to see the new 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.700
 aspect of the ior was an improvement 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.679
 visual accompanied by the corner but 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.840
 well it seems that riot does not have 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.689
 thought to visually touch up ravel this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.569
 year 2014 and well we have almost four 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.280
 months of this 2014 and according to riot he said that 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.539
 this was going to be the year of the changes and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.580
 It seems that at the moment we have only 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.110
 seen the changes in heimerdinger if 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.630
 well it's true they have also retouched 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.009
 dif for example but what good home 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 we all expected would be changes by 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.479
 example in champions like zion saco 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.459
 tÃ¡riq enlist et cetera etcetera et de 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.929
 moment we continue waiting so good 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.579
 let's hope that the river gets the batteries and 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.489
 we go showing content that there 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.620
 you gain the truth and it seems to be also that 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.849
 the same thing that has happened with the guardian 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.280
 of the spirits that has a skin 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.620
 definitively incredible it seems that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.970
 the same thing will happen with rumble your 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.530
 main skin and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.210
 The champion's main appearance is going to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.220
 remain the same will remain 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.860
 obsolete while going to have a 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.810
 corner where everything has improved so much 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.460
 movement the textures the particles 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.840
 so good it seems to be repeated 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.090
 in the case I hope it does not come back to 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.500
 happen more champions who take a 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 skin of this style also modify 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.280
 to the main champion something good too 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.990
 I would like to know west what is yours 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.850
 opinion on these news and you can go 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.410
 commenting that you are appearing this 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.440
 topic so good let's talk 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.440
 now patch 4.5 inside the patch 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.790
 4.5 that will be more or less and without dates 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.480
 officers along the next 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.860
 week or within two are more or less 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.840
 possible dates we can find 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.570
 enough changes and aspects as for 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.550
 example if it comes atlante rumble super 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.830
 galactic the new vacuum fit skin 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.270
 and maybe if riot hurries with the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.970
 improvement of the rental skin we can 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.680
 see it included in patch 4.5 also 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.660
 everything indicates that we can see the flange 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.180
 tiers that is currently undergoing changes 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.160
 the ridge rent the changes or rewards 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.350
 of pantheon that by the way continue 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.970
 constant changes without going any further yesterday 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.040
 have returned to expand the range of the ultimate 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 and finally maybe the changes in my 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.879
 fortune as they continue in tests 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.739
 we will wait to talk about them in 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.209
 next videos we've also gone 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.470
 commenting on these days there are 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 to wait a little bit but you know 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.890
 that in the baby server are 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.599
 constantly with changes then if 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.849
 I mention something now maybe tomorrow 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.830
 completely different and be a little 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.120
 I'm afraid for everyone to also tell you that a 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.920
 throughout these days we will see the ex 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.269
 squares of the new skins the truth is 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.250
 which is something that I really want now 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.620
 that lately is the squares of riot 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.060
 they are amazing and good after 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.640
 go over the content a little 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.230
 of this patch 4.5 if we realize 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.909
 we already have two complete patches without 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.620
 new champion in sight that wants 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.170
 say that surely when the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.940
 patch output 4.5 we will start to 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.160
 have news of an upcoming champion 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.890
 According to Rivers, this year he wants to take 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.049
 enough monster-shaped champions 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.519
 in the shape of a monster see belco and if 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.260
 we realize a riot confirmed that 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.000
 for the first part of 2014 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.799
 we would have a new support therefore 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.269
 My bet is that the next champion 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.430
 It will be support and with the appearance of 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.660
 monster as well as you already know 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.520
 you can comment and create a small 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.889
 debate to see which is the champion who 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.630
 you wait or want in following parts 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.039
 I hope you liked it as always 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.570

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.920
