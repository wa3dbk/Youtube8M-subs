00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.010
 hello hello welcome to all and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 all on cocotte tv today a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 new video presentation of the offense 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 ultra high end for a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 ultra muscular configuration or so a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 configuration that will serve a lot yesterday 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 at the meeting we will talk about the x 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.690
 1500 wii two corsairs a diet 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.120
 who is the first to formalize the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.320
 80plus titanium that is to say a novel 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 which can reach up to 94% 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.379
 the diet comes with all the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 options we usually have 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.840
 Corsair as a big guarantee of 7 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.270
 years a semi fanless fan or 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 still the corsair link cables crowd 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.140
 modular brief we discover all this all 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 immediately together a little word on the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.210
 price between 399 and 449 euros at the time of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 the output tablons more on 449 euros because 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 formatting power supplies are a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.830
 standard is rare right now in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 because of the configurations for the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.159
 meeting is so I pay bitcoin on 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.460
 we 'll meet you right now 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 to discover the bundle at the level of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390
 bundle you'll see it's pretty 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 simple on the instructions for use the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.520
 guarantee of eight schoolchildren with the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 fasteners and a little cancer logo to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.850
 stick on your rate and finally the cord 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 feeding for our version of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 test we have a cordon us so be careful 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.920
 where you see the cord here even has 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 not the same format as usual we do not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 can not put a cable 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 classic feeding 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 inside he of laymen 5500 he does not 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.229
 will absolutely not lose your body 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 no power on those there one 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.829
 discovers all the cables that will be 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.229
 delivered with 7 to x 1500 wii and you go 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 to see it is a mega collection of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.360
 cables that we propose 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.969
 corsair then on this set on this 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 table where you will find in front of 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.340
 you 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.319
 a number of connectors totally 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.830
 impressive we will go around 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.860
 very quickly we have the 24 pin ats 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 we then have two cases trippin cpu 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:30.769
 then we have one two three four five 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.629
 six PCI Express cables with a plug 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.340
 compatible 6 8 pin 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:42.110
 then we find one two three cables 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.879
 with two pci express 6 8 pin plugs 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.019
 so we have plenty of things to do 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.410
 PCI Express level 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.390
 we then have a cable with four sockets 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.510
 a second cable with four sockets 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.910
 sata a third cable with four 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.760
 taken sata again a cable with 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.690
 four sata sockets is still a small 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.209
 last for the road 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.660
 then we have cables with 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.569
 four floppy plugs so we have one of 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.989
 taken copycat taken molex on has 1 2 3 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.389
 so 12 taking molex 16 sata 6 doubles 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:21.349
 pci express 6 pci express double 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:24.590
 cable finally double pin and sicable pci 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.139
 express in simple connector finally we have 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.930
 Molex adapters to floppy on to 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.090
 the usb to the as so and the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.829
 device for the corsair link as much 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.419
 to say that you will be able to connect 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.200
 almost anything you want on your 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:42.650
 at x 1500 wii we finish now with 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.019
 the block is so this blog 1500 wii is 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.000
 still so pretty that there is no 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.950
 problem at this level we find the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720
 shapes we already had on the rm we 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.880
 has already found at other brands 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.209
 on the top we find the fine grid 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.120
 the 140mm fan that will be 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.359
 semi- passive or semi-active type to you of 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.739
 see 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.220
 it does not work from 0 to 20% in two 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.510
 fillers or you 25% load up to 50% 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.220
 of charge he was turning some 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.709
 speed for 10 db after it increases 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.930
 gradually on the sides we have the 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.030
 Corsair and ax 1100 logos 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.400
 without him one finds of course the same 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.970
 logo on the other side but in the good 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.669
 meaning 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.440
 in the front we will find the different 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.070
 connectors for modular cables 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.060
 but not only here we have the part 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:36.880
 for the 24-pin tea xx next 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.070
 come the party for the PCI Express 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.820
 for pci express and pine cellars 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.590
 so we have both rows 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.650
 then we have everything we need for 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.520
 peripherals so sata is taking molex 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:55.370
 next comes the self test button the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.889
 the com and the necessary for the Corsican 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.259
 arts inc brief we rather have a 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.740
 complete connectivity 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:05.570
 in the back we have a typical design grid 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.900
 honeycomb as always on the 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.030
 animates 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.729
 we have the enough in with its shape 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:16.340
 specific the switch and a small 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:19.430
 logo at x 1500 beds speaks under the block 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.440
 we have nothing special under the block or 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.780
 above the block that's according to the 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.770
 position that one has in the machine by 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.710
 against we have the characteristics 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.039
 techniques we say we're on 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.680
 titanium not platinum and we have 1 3 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.050
 ol3 of 30 years loses 1.5 volts of 30 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.710
 amps and 1 12 volts that just totalizes 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:46.280
 125 earth for 1500 watts so big 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.139
 guarantee 7 years big tariffs go we're going 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.470
 say 425 euros to cut the pear in 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.789
 two between 399 and 449 that I thought 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.250
 not really at what price the line not 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.580
 arrived big big big connectivity 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.800
 first cited certification titanium on 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.270
 so offers you this video that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.250
 were there for the presentation and have 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.690
 beautiful especially the complete test of this 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.580
 feeding very soon on 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.820
 cowcotland.com and on that we tell you to 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.820
 very soon
