well<00:00:06.189> now<00:00:06.729> that<00:00:06.759> it's<00:00:07.090> summer<00:00:07.180> I<00:00:07.630> thought<00:00:08.440> I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
well now that it's summer I thought I

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.410 
well now that it's summer I thought I
might<00:00:08.740> take<00:00:08.920> my<00:00:09.099> try<00:00:09.519> my<00:00:09.580> hand<00:00:09.849> at<00:00:10.030> making<00:00:10.179> a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
might take my try my hand at making a

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660 
might take my try my hand at making a
miniature<00:00:10.780> solar<00:00:11.110> array<00:00:11.469> so<00:00:12.370> this<00:00:12.490> would<00:00:12.640> be

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
miniature solar array so this would be

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.810 
miniature solar array so this would be
my<00:00:12.850> supports<00:00:13.390> for<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:13.690> mirrors<00:00:14.580> I'll<00:00:15.580> cut

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
my supports for the mirrors I'll cut

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.390 
my supports for the mirrors I'll cut
these<00:00:15.970> out<00:00:16.180> who<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.840> mayor's<00:00:17.050> out<00:00:17.260> here<00:00:17.619> and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
these out who the mayor's out here and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.989 
these out who the mayor's out here and
they'll<00:00:18.820> have<00:00:19.980> drill<00:00:20.980> some<00:00:21.099> holes<00:00:21.159> here<00:00:21.669> to

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:21.999 
they'll have drill some holes here to

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:43.830 
they'll have drill some holes here to
mount<00:00:22.869> them

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880 

let's<00:00:44.840> have<00:00:45.050> them<00:00:45.140> cut<00:00:45.379> out<00:00:45.410> they<00:00:45.710> look<00:00:45.859> a

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
let's have them cut out they look a

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.389 
let's have them cut out they look a
little<00:00:46.070> about<00:00:46.610> like<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.860> each<00:00:48.860> one<00:00:49.160> has<00:00:49.370> a

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
little about like this each one has a

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.160 
little about like this each one has a
different<00:00:49.550> slightly<00:00:50.359> different<00:00:50.809> focal

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
different slightly different focal

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.610 
different slightly different focal
length<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.769> little<00:00:52.610> different<00:00:52.940> angle<00:00:53.239> on<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
length a little different angle on the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.770 
length a little different angle on the
for<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.710> panels<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:55.909> know<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:56.360> they<00:00:56.480> can<00:00:56.510> be

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
for the panels you know so they can be

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.689 
for the panels you know so they can be
spaced<00:00:57.199> roughly<00:00:57.620> two<00:00:57.769> inches<00:00:58.039> apart<00:00:58.339> on<00:00:58.610> the

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
spaced roughly two inches apart on the

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.810 
spaced roughly two inches apart on the
final<00:00:59.949> final<00:01:00.949> array<00:01:02.860> basically<00:01:03.860> i<00:01:04.100> will<00:01:04.640> be

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
final final array basically i will be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.779 
final final array basically i will be
using<00:01:05.540> these<00:01:05.899> 1-inch<00:01:06.860> mirrors<00:01:09.490> i'm<00:01:10.490> going<00:01:10.729> to

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
using these 1-inch mirrors i'm going to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.249 
using these 1-inch mirrors i'm going to
be<00:01:10.850> glued<00:01:11.090> onto<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.140> various<00:01:12.409> panels<00:01:14.259> that

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
be glued onto the various panels that

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.450 
be glued onto the various panels that
 fit<00:01:15.740> all<00:01:15.890> right<00:01:17.590> run<00:01:18.590> each<00:01:18.770> spot<00:01:21.460> de

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
 fit all right run each spot de

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.840 
 fit all right run each spot de
plume<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:24.770> smaller<00:01:25.159> one<00:01:25.460> way<00:01:25.640> than

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
plume this one here smaller one way than

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
plume this one here smaller one way than
the<00:01:26.000> other<00:01:30.190> so<00:01:31.190> should<00:01:31.369> lay<00:01:31.550> them<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:31.850> first

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.110 

alright<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:38.580> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> clamp<00:01:38.970> down

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
alright so we're going to clamp down

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.140 
alright so we're going to clamp down
there<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.260> make<00:01:40.410> sure<00:01:40.440> they<00:01:40.770> sit<00:01:41.150> flush

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
there want to make sure they sit flush

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.740 
there want to make sure they sit flush
with<00:01:42.860> from<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.980> side<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.940> they're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
with from the side and this way they're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
with from the side and this way they're
wise<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.410> they're<00:01:46.650> not<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.979> even<00:01:47.670> when

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
wise way if they're not all even when

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
wise way if they're not all even when
you're<00:01:47.940> trying<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.270> focus<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.560> mirrors<00:01:50.000> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you're trying to focus the mirrors it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
you're trying to focus the mirrors it's
not<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> line<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.620> right

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
not going to line up for you all right

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.180 
not going to line up for you all right
we<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.160> our<00:01:53.300> solar<00:01:54.300> right<00:01:54.660> here<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.950> some

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
we have our solar right here at some

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.150 
we have our solar right here at some
point<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.550> may<00:01:56.580> link<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.550> the<00:02:01.160> segment's

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
point we may link the the segment's

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.910 
point we may link the the segment's
mirror<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:02.760> they<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:04.170> coordinated<00:02:04.800> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
mirror so they can be coordinated in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
mirror so they can be coordinated in
their<00:02:05.040> movement<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
their movement here this will be a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.479 
their movement here this will be a
collector<00:02:07.890> stand<00:02:09.830> I'll<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:11.040> gluing<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
collector stand I'll be gluing that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.470 
collector stand I'll be gluing that
together<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.550> cut<00:02:14.940> from<00:02:14.970> piece<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
together this is cut from piece of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.440 
together this is cut from piece of
copper<00:02:15.840> I'll<00:02:16.650> dark<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.130> side<00:02:17.450> engine

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
copper I'll dark on this side engine

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.560 
copper I'll dark on this side engine
will<00:02:18.900> sit<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> we'll<00:02:20.940> test<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
will sit here and we'll test out the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.410 
will sit here and we'll test out the
array<00:02:23.660> okay<00:02:24.660> here's<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.020> mini<00:02:25.260> solar<00:02:25.530> array

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
array okay here's the mini solar array

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.350 
array okay here's the mini solar array
power<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> Phoenix<00:02:28.380> engine<00:02:29.000> main<00:02:30.000> issue

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
power in the Phoenix engine main issue

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.390 
power in the Phoenix engine main issue
I'm<00:02:30.630> running<00:02:30.930> into<00:02:31.230> with<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.410> design<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
I'm running into with this design as the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640 
I'm running into with this design as the
top<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> engine<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.140> direct<00:02:37.350> sunlight

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
top of the engine is in direct sunlight

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.630 
top of the engine is in direct sunlight
so<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.780> gets<00:02:39.780> pretty<00:02:40.020> hot<00:02:40.320> while<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> bottoms

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
so it gets pretty hot while the bottoms

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.870 
so it gets pretty hot while the bottoms
heating<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> go<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:46.700> put<00:02:47.700> ice

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
heating up so to get it to go I put ice

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.600 
heating up so to get it to go I put ice
cube<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.299> top<00:02:48.630> kind<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.019> cheating<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:52.610> might

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
cube on top kind of cheating but might

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.770 
cube on top kind of cheating but might
try<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> different<00:02:54.269> approach<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
try a different approach to the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.509 
try a different approach to the
construction<00:02:57.830> well<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.920> works<00:02:59.630> we<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
construction well it works we have a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.640 
construction well it works we have a
copper<00:03:02.519> panel<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.989> pretty<00:03:04.260> hot<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
copper panel it's pretty hot to the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.850 
copper panel it's pretty hot to the
touch<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.810> array<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.079> reflecting<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> light

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
touch the array is reflecting the light

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.620 
touch the array is reflecting the light
now<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.489> sun's<00:03:08.790> behind<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.150> clouds<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
now the sun's behind the clouds at the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.559 
now the sun's behind the clouds at the
moment
