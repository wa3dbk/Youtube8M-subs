00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.520 

but<00:01:15.220> yeah<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.760> that's<00:01:17.030> what's<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:18.110> correct

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
but yeah so that's what's just correct

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.070 
but yeah so that's what's just correct
is<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
is this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.490 
is this
but<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.950> board<00:01:22.190> itself<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.790> cheap<00:01:23.060> if<00:01:23.500> you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
but the board itself is cheap if you

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.920 
but the board itself is cheap if you
like<00:01:25.330> 7.5<00:01:26.330> that's<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.510> probably<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
like 7.5 that's this is probably the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.990 
like 7.5 that's this is probably the
best<00:01:30.170> website<00:01:30.680> even<00:01:30.890> voted<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.580> get<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.730> board

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
best website even voted to get a board

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840 
best website even voted to get a board
because<00:01:32.300> they're<00:01:33.110> really<00:01:33.590> cheap<00:01:34.370> when

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
because they're really cheap when

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.540 
because they're really cheap when
they're<00:01:35.180> 7.5<00:01:35.650> but<00:01:36.650> once<00:01:36.800> you<00:01:36.950> get<00:01:37.100> up<00:01:37.250> to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
they're 7.5 but once you get up to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.050 
they're 7.5 but once you get up to
bigger<00:01:37.970> sizes<00:01:38.330> they<00:01:39.170> only<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.470> three<00:01:39.710> sizes

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
bigger sizes they only have three sizes

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.920 
bigger sizes they only have three sizes
7.5<00:01:42.580> 7.75<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.880> eight<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:47.270> once<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.750> get<00:01:47.900> to

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
7.5 7.75 and eight so once you get to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.140 
7.5 7.75 and eight so once you get to
eight<00:01:48.170> its<00:01:48.620> twenty<00:01:48.980> dollars<00:01:49.460> for<00:01:49.730> one<00:01:49.760> deck

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
eight its twenty dollars for one deck

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.480 
eight its twenty dollars for one deck
which<00:01:50.510> is<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.990> think<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:51.470> really<00:01:51.830> big<00:01:52.070> rip<00:01:52.280> up

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
which is I think it's really big rip up

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.149 
which is I think it's really big rip up
so<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.270> may<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:53.630> well<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.470> your<00:01:54.740> pro<00:01:55.070> or

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.509 

their<00:01:59.929> quality<00:02:02.689> I'd<00:02:03.689> rate<00:02:04.079> them<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> 3<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> 5

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.609 

they'll<00:02:08.519> ask<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.849> around<00:02:09.209> two<00:02:09.479> months<00:02:09.629> each

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
they'll ask me around two months each

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.559 
they'll ask me around two months each
board<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> less<00:02:11.310> than<00:02:11.489> me<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:11.879> two<00:02:12.120> months<00:02:12.269> I

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
board is less than me about two months I

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.920 
board is less than me about two months I
think<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:14.310> good<00:02:14.430> pop<00:02:14.819> especially<00:02:15.780> when

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
think really good pop especially when

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.690 
think really good pop especially when
you<00:02:15.989> first<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> first<00:02:17.160> get<00:02:17.340> them<00:02:17.549> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you first get when you first get them to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.220 
you first get when you first get them to
pop<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.390> awesome<00:02:20.000> around<00:02:21.000> two<00:02:21.780> months<00:02:21.959> is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
pop is so awesome around two months is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
pop is so awesome around two months is
when<00:02:22.440> they<00:02:22.590> start<00:02:22.620> losing<00:02:23.040> their<00:02:23.250> pop<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
when they start losing their pop and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.730 
when they start losing their pop and
then<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.360> all

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
then they all

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.290 
then they all
sudden<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.130> break<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.950> yeah<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.820> durability

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
sudden just break so yeah the durability

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.070 
sudden just break so yeah the durability
is<00:02:29.900> only<00:02:30.200> two<00:02:30.590> months<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.210> skating<00:02:32.660> level

more<00:02:48.890> often<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:49.430> but<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.910> never<00:02:50.270> land

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
more often now but I just never land

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.150 
more often now but I just never land
both<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.400> was<00:02:52.640> much<00:02:53.090> worse<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.600> my<00:02:53.720> board

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
both so that was much worse on my board

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.880 
both so that was much worse on my board
but<00:02:55.330> if<00:02:56.330> you're<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> be<00:02:56.870> skating<00:02:57.320> steps

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
but if you're going to be skating steps

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.940 
but if you're going to be skating steps
all<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.490> time<00:02:59.000> like<00:02:59.330> larger<00:03:00.290> number<00:03:00.590> steps

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
all the time like larger number steps

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.790 
all the time like larger number steps
say<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:02.090> seven<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.840> you're<00:03:03.590> going<00:03:03.740> to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
say like seven and up you're going to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.420 
say like seven and up you're going to
break<00:03:03.890> your<00:03:04.160> board<00:03:04.430> much<00:03:04.850> faster

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.420 

they<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.019> get<00:03:10.170> them<00:03:10.319> wet<00:03:10.349> you're<00:03:11.189> just

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
they if you get them wet you're just

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.530 
they if you get them wet you're just
wearing<00:03:11.700> its<00:03:12.180> quality<00:03:13.909> these<00:03:14.909> fully<00:03:15.239> painted

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
wearing its quality these fully painted

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.470 
wearing its quality these fully painted
boards<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.319> just<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> grade<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.489> don't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
boards I just have a grade one I don't

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.830 
boards I just have a grade one I don't
think<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.750> last<00:03:19.019> as<00:03:19.230> long<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:20.840> died

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
think they last as long as these died

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.199 
think they last as long as these died
wood<00:03:22.290> ones<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:23.969> the<00:03:24.180> opportunity

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
wood ones so if you have the opportunity

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.789 
wood ones so if you have the opportunity
to<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> diet<00:03:25.290> would<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.859> other<00:03:26.700> than<00:03:26.730> a

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
to get a diet would one other than a

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.170 
to get a diet would one other than a
fully<00:03:28.799> painted<00:03:29.010> because<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.730> fully<00:03:29.939> painted

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
fully painted because the fully painted

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.069 
fully painted because the fully painted
one<00:03:30.450> its<00:03:30.750> tail<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:32.250> lost<00:03:32.730> its<00:03:33.030> pop<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.900> was

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
one its tail it lost its pop so I was

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.199

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
tail and then its tail just snapped in

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.920 
tail and then its tail just snapped in
half<00:03:38.639> like<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.719> cracked

half like it cracked

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.890 
half like it cracked
that's

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.720

when I landed like in the center and

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.750 
when I landed like in the center and
that<00:04:01.000> hurt<00:04:01.239> really<00:04:01.450> bad<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:03.310> was<00:04:03.489> really

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
unexpected

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.429 
unexpected
because<00:04:04.969> I'd<00:04:05.390> only<00:04:05.629> have<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.019> board<00:04:06.260> for

because I'd only have the board for
about<00:04:06.650> two<00:04:06.859> and<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.099> half<00:04:07.129> months<00:04:08.499> but<00:04:09.499> these

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
about two and a half months but these

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.170 
about two and a half months but these
are<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.670> better<00:04:11.439> quality<00:04:12.439> I<00:04:12.650> recommend<00:04:13.189> these

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
are the better quality I recommend these

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.710 
are the better quality I recommend these
are<00:04:14.480> dyed<00:04:14.810> wood<00:04:15.170> ones<00:04:16.120> they<00:04:17.120> act<00:04:17.329> just<00:04:17.509> like

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
are dyed wood ones they act just like

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.740 
are dyed wood ones they act just like
any<00:04:18.199> other<00:04:18.320> blank<00:04:18.970> seven<00:04:19.970> playa<00:04:20.209> canadian

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
any other blank seven playa canadian

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.469 
any other blank seven playa canadian
maple<00:04:20.870> don't<00:04:21.829> expected<00:04:22.430> dad's<00:04:22.669> better<00:04:23.150> and

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
maple don't expected dad's better and

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.570 
maple don't expected dad's better and
don't<00:04:23.599> expect<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.259> adverse<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.160> acts<00:04:25.400> just

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
don't expect it to adverse it acts just

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.089 
don't expect it to adverse it acts just
like<00:04:26.590> now<00:04:27.590> its<00:04:27.770> grip<00:04:28.039> tape<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:29.270> like<00:04:29.599> jessa

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
like now its grip tape it's like jessa

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.620 
like now its grip tape it's like jessa
same<00:04:31.099> grip<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.460> Jessup<00:04:31.880> when<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.150> first<00:04:32.419> get

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
same grip is Jessup when you first get

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.950 
same grip is Jessup when you first get
it<00:04:32.810> but<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.470> think<00:04:33.620> Jessup<00:04:34.250> will<00:04:34.599> stay<00:04:35.599> square

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
it but I think Jessup will stay square

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.170 
it but I think Jessup will stay square
feet<00:04:36.169> longer<00:04:36.440> these<00:04:37.250> don't<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.090> lose

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
feet longer these don't like to lose

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.879 
feet longer these don't like to lose
their<00:04:38.479> grip<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.960> then<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:39.289> of<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.440> sudden<00:04:39.470> it's

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
their grip and then all of a sudden it's

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.620 
their grip and then all of a sudden it's
total<00:04:40.880> crap<00:04:41.110> but<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.410> just<00:04:42.680> think<00:04:42.770> Jessa<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.630> a

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
total crap but I just think Jessa is a

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.260 
total crap but I just think Jessa is a
little<00:04:45.110> bit<00:04:45.320> here<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.280> this<00:04:46.789> will<00:04:47.000> still

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
little bit here and it this will still

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.029 
little bit here and it this will still
much<00:04:47.449> to<00:04:47.630> shoo<00:04:47.870> them<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.259> think<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.710> messes

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
much to shoo them I think it messes

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.610 
much to shoo them I think it messes
you're<00:04:49.190> shooting<00:04:49.460> up<00:04:49.580> more<00:04:49.820> than<00:04:50.000> Jessa<00:04:50.620> but

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
you're shooting up more than Jessa but

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.550 
you're shooting up more than Jessa but
it<00:04:51.800> loses<00:04:52.160> his<00:04:52.550> grip<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.259> don't<00:04:54.320> know<00:04:54.470> how

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
it loses his grip like I don't know how

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.159 
it loses his grip like I don't know how
to<00:04:54.710> explain<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:56.300> doesn't<00:04:56.750> really<00:04:56.900> make

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
to explain it it doesn't really make

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.379 
to explain it it doesn't really make
sense<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:57.740> it'll<00:04:58.039> mess<00:04:58.220> your<00:04:58.460> shoes<00:04:58.699> up<00:04:58.910> Orson

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
sense but it'll mess your shoes up Orson

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.800 
sense but it'll mess your shoes up Orson
Jessup<00:05:00.130> but<00:05:01.130> isn't<00:05:01.520> as<00:05:01.639> high<00:05:01.970> quality<00:05:02.570> and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
Jessup but isn't as high quality and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.210 
Jessup but isn't as high quality and
does<00:05:03.020> not<00:05:03.259> grip<00:05:04.190> as<00:05:04.460> well

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.880 

so<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:07.850> recommend<00:05:08.240> these<00:05:08.630> boards<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.380> grip<00:05:09.740> is

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
so I recommend these boards this grip is
