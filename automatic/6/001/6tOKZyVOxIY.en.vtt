00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
same I don't ever 2008 CDP pack so these

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.860 
same I don't ever 2008 CDP pack so these
only<00:02:40.000> chunk<00:02:40.239> apparent<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:45.510> back<00:02:46.510> then<00:02:46.720> these

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
only chunk apparent to back then these

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.460 
only chunk apparent to back then these
were<00:02:47.019> made<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.380> China<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:49.390> 2001<00:02:50.049> now<00:02:50.290> they

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
were made in China that's 2001 now they

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.520 
were made in China that's 2001 now they
made<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:52.060> still<00:02:52.450> China<00:02:52.750> they<00:02:53.230> used<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.440> be

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
made in well still China they used to be

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.009 
made in well still China they used to be
made<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:53.829> Taiwan<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.329> maybe<00:02:55.690> that's<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
made in Taiwan so maybe that's a
