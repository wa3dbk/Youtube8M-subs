00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello everyone talks to them the first kira today I will talk about the 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.900
 anime censorship in mexico this topic as the years went by he left 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.530
 making it more annoying for the audience that we delight in the anime since 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 for a bad concept of the population on the anime this was worth that 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.400
 the anime in both open television and pay television went 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.859
 censoring more and more and more in the decade of the 90 there was quite anime 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.910
 at that time the programming was very good many will remember that the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.260
 children's programming was quite anime branch 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.010
 dragon goal 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.470
 doctors never sahil concrete 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.220
 i robot etc candy candy 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.630
 the magic warriors 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.690
 my camila sinister ghost hunter 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.840
 Gradually this program was removed channel 5 went away 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.880
 becoming a channel of pure caricatures leaving little of anime 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.219
 the same thing happened with cardboard eto'o hangs 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.479
 it was said a lot in the media that there was a lot of violence 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.170
 extreme senati smo was promoted 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.220
 subliminal messages and many more things that always criticized the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.320
 anime but they never managed to remove 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 to the best anime of all time 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 dragon goal remembering a little more the 90 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 you had to do a whole odyssey to get anime 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.940
 It was the year 1996 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.980
 the anime conventions appear and at the same time the channel does not like they are 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.940
 over the years locomotion gradually became a channel of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.430
 anime 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.250
 thanks to this the promotion and the popularity of the anime was growing 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 more merchandising and ways to get anime easier in early 2005 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.350
 not like they are and the children's channels with very little anime 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.900
 but thanks to the internet the duties and the popularity with which the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.429
 anime 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.420
 six months later he was born in imax 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.530
 on channel 5 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 I trust is broadcast during 2006 you whose withdraws from television and 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 who complained that the demons were summoned by the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 letters all apparently normal 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.319
 in 2006 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.510
 channel 7 with anime programming 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.720
 the same thing happens the anime is removed months later comes wampis transmitted some 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.290
 time retired again and finally the crisis of 2008 animax in decline it 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.950
 remove the already few videos of hip-hop and rock transmitted 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.269
 Japanese music is no longer promoted 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.959
 they put groups that have nothing to do with the anime 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.749
 as miranda for giving an example 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.549
 mid-2008 comes a change of animax programming begins to take off 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.310
 reality show movies that have nothing to do with anime 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.769
 in my opinion this channel goes from bad to worse 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.279
 instead of taking out all that should be an anime block one of doramas 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.919
 and another one of Japanese music 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.749
 I'm sure that my mac would become more popular we hope that our voice will 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.459
 I listened 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.709
 we want a Mexico without so much censorship 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.019
 without so much fanaticism that's all for the moment 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.009
 you say goodbye to you the first team
