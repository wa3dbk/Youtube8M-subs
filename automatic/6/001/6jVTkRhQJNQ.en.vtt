00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 Tell me guys, what the hell, and I broke up. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.910
 remembering that I can also open pecs 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.769
 with my other account then it was good already 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.950
 That promotion will not be long 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.330
 then 50 thousand people are running because 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.820
 try once again great luck will 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 see 50,000 copies being toasted 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'll do differently I will not look 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
 I'm keeping an eye on it, it 's new and it's not 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 try to take a look 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.320
 I can hear the music today, I 'm not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 hearing that there was an exchange of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.910
 volleyball now I'm going to look slow I saw 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.800
 Who has not turned up yet? 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.800
 disappeared I'll read slowly ii 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 My God of heaven 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.730
 It was really a beautiful piece of crap. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.489
 best player ramires has the marquinhos 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 Also over 500 km and that this noia 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.410
 fake and limeira 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 I thought it was a bride but it's weird. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 several players in the series gave 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 right 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 the opening of pecs and 50,000 bodies were 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.240
 for space let's now see another 50 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.020
 thousand with her that I opened because I do not know if 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 I must open it happens this time I go 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 to look into the eye was also to make 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.770
 here all possible data 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.240
 and imaginable who knows we do not see suarez 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.560
 a reason for the last decision and benzema 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 benzema very good but it is not expensive 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.500
 unfortunately it means loss to us 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 still our lady, paulinho ralf 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 my god only in corinthians players 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.790
 but it could still have been very 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.930
 worse was so bad and I 'm also 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 now your comments are going to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.680
 there is something decent in this 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 aspect you have bad luck like me to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.430
 nearly 200,000 dogs and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.950
 I could not 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.990
 literally nothing so it's basically 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.780
 this video too fast brigado 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 the average cost of support because it is 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 as usual the caps haase de 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.110
