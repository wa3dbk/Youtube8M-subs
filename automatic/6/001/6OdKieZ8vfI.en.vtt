00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.990
 so beware here as well is the ultimate this concerns 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.430
 now happy 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.119
 the sun actually shines this so-called 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.569
 about 6 4 1 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.299
 Under the sun shines against this firm I calculated yes calculated 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.869
 On the one hand the PC will be 1000h 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.970
 then Essers Bayer de 51 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.339
 and often the PC will be 1000h II again 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.829
 the new round 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.479
 Upheaval of 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.060
 so it's models with you do it come to me and 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.690
 which also with 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.400
 around 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.219
 because only seven games blocked 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.150
 and I was overwhelmed often looks 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.410
 I have all three models 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.400
 set to the highest brightness levels 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.540
 the Ubuntu 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.160
 Peter Fuchs so far a bit darker 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.420
 Of course, you can not have anything left to do photos Flory like that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.310
 You can also rent a car with Brawn 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.530
 Wunsiedel - little something 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.770
 how will that be even maturity stage in the sun behold 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.960
 Herm 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.729
 why BPC 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.870
 Supermodel Christie Brinkley 55 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.480
 I am very satisfied 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.670
 Gabriel 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.110
 Wilders reunion the track now that should be expensive during 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.479
 the riots 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.130
 We are definitely over mirroring somewhere next to this duo from 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.710
 Bundeswehroberst Georg Klein the consequences 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.480
 No 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.510
 times performed fur how important are 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.890
 Wowereit has 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.390
 a thousand highway 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.640
 The new model, I have a bluetooth module as well 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.860
 No, that is also the most recent brightness levels 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 here, too, you can only see a few fingerprints on it 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 would be around 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.080
 47 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.930
 and just sees that Munz 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.320
 especially when it's in the break 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.550
 that is in winter when milk is swallow 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.150
 who speaks already disappeared 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.880
 and it is infinitely difficult 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 it gives with the pass to the 1 0 beats exactly the same 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.660
 he is not very bright either 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.830
 also attained in a second reach then helps want to reach 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.259
 that the fire and the 51st 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.729
 Well, that's just her first project 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.339
 not clear 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.420
 the cook you sprinkle on her but this is definitely not noticed 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.539
 as if this is not 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.539
 Euro referenced 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.289
 and the good goal is to be products Scooter for the battery life 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.489
 as that and i was not tested it just for fun and pleasure 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.679
 Lucky 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.439
 but he does it through more 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.529
 but prompt 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.699
 Clearly you can get on the floor groups 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.699
 but quite the same way we would see the system then 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.639
 you should have a look at the display of players 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.899
 decide 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.349
 I just want to see more as I said 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.169
 I am very good with such information 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.459
 it is unclear whether see the picture 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.219
 quite as much at stake our roots 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.739
 but 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.159
 I can see through it "I have patience" ranks 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.429
 anyway Thomas Drozda cover 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.439
 to have a thousand 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.329
 Make 105 students 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.529
 and around 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.269
 to complain to Grafite 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.659
 that's a good mathieu this is to be done i guess 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.999
 That should have been clear to all 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.869
 why the manufacturers 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.689
 Lohse pointed out Belsen's sale 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.090
 Bruno to the customers Klose have fun and
