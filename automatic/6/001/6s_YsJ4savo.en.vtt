00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.230 
a slightly better color yes I have and
that<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:25.859> bumblebee<00:00:26.400> as<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> see

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
that was bumblebee as you can see
Cliffjumper<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> same<00:00:28.830> mold<00:00:29.130> as

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
Cliffjumper is the same mold as

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
Cliffjumper is the same mold as
bumblebee<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.420> different<00:00:30.869> colors<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
bumblebee but with different colors and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.420 
bumblebee but with different colors and
a<00:00:32.070> different<00:00:32.460> head<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.260> mean<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a different head so I mean if you can

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
a different head so I mean if you can
see<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> both<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.570> similar<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> mean

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
see the both are similar so I mean

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
see the both are similar so I mean
there's<00:00:38.460> no<00:00:38.640> difference<00:00:39.270> only<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
there's no difference only just the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's no difference only just the
color<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.010> different<00:00:41.399> head<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
color and a different head so so the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
color and a different head so so the
best<00:00:44.879> part<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> wherever<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.410> red

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
best part I like is wherever it's red

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.549 
best part I like is wherever it's red
like<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.329> bumblebee<00:00:48.870> where<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.379> got

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like from from bumblebee where it's got

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.549

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
you sort of speak and I don't have the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.010 
you sort of speak and I don't have the
classics<00:02:42.340> Cliffjumper<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.300> do<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> comparison

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
classics Cliffjumper to do a comparison

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.070 
classics Cliffjumper to do a comparison
but<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.590> pretty<00:02:44.920> I'm<00:02:45.160> pretty<00:02:45.220> sure<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
but I pretty I'm pretty sure that the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.350 
but I pretty I'm pretty sure that the
head<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.010> same<00:02:48.220> thing<00:02:48.430> as<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.850> classics

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
head is the same thing as the classics

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.960 
head is the same thing as the classics
Cliffjumper<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:51.220> kind<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.489> sucks<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.940> don't

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
Cliffjumper and it kind of sucks I don't

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.360 
Cliffjumper and it kind of sucks I don't
have<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.840> figure<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.290> compare<00:02:53.860> cuz<00:02:54.190> that'll

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
have that figure to compare cuz that'll

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.900 
have that figure to compare cuz that'll
be<00:02:54.489> great<00:02:54.850> comparison<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.840> let<00:02:56.709> me<00:02:56.830> zoom<00:02:57.640> out

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
be great comparison so let me zoom out

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.360 
be great comparison so let me zoom out
and<00:02:58.239> show<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.290> comparison<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.950> bumpy

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
and show you the comparison of bumpy

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.759 
and show you the comparison of bumpy
which<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.820> just<00:03:01.060> transformed<00:03:01.780> off<00:03:01.930> camera

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
which I just transformed off camera

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.370 
which I just transformed off camera
because<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:04.660> want<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.840> waste<00:03:05.110> my<00:03:05.350> time

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
because I don't want to waste my time

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.070 
because I don't want to waste my time
you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:05.920> recording<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:07.330> same<00:03:07.600> thing<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
you know recording the same thing I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.640 
you know recording the same thing I
think<00:03:08.290> I've<00:03:08.350> always<00:03:08.560> done<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.320> mean<00:03:11.470> let

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
think I've always done so so I mean let

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.800 
think I've always done so so I mean let
me<00:03:11.739> get<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.280> movie<00:03:12.610> here<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.090> go<00:03:13.239> we<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.450> boom

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
me get the movie here we go we have boom

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.390 
me get the movie here we go we have boom
movie<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:15.030> first<00:03:16.030> comparison<00:03:16.600> noise<00:03:17.470> yeah<00:03:18.040> as

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
movie and first comparison noise yeah as

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
movie and first comparison noise yeah as
you<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.549> see<00:03:18.640> that's<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.239> colour<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.780> I'm

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you can see that's the colour and I'm

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.319 
you can see that's the colour and I'm
really<00:03:20.920> surprised<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.790> difference<00:03:22.180> you

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
really surprised that the difference you

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.410 
really surprised that the difference you
see<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.959> height<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.650> them<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.340> mean<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.760> know

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
see is the height of them I mean I know

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.970 
see is the height of them I mean I know
it's<00:03:25.630> basically<00:03:25.840> because<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.799> move

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it's basically because you have to move

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.910 
it's basically because you have to move
the<00:03:27.160> leg<00:03:27.340> around<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.880> give<00:03:28.239> them<00:03:28.329> posed<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.829> if

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the leg around to give them posed but if

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.800 
the leg around to give them posed but if
you<00:03:30.010> look<00:03:30.160> at<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> height<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.030> these<00:03:31.180> two<00:03:31.480> let

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
you look at the height of these two let

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.060 
you look at the height of these two let
me<00:03:33.030> put<00:03:34.030> them<00:03:34.120> like<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:34.930> back<00:03:35.620> show

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
me put them like this and just back show

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.420 
me put them like this and just back show
you<00:03:36.160> something<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:38.260> they're<00:03:38.739> not<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.400> same

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
you something and they're not the same

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.590 
you something and they're not the same
height<00:03:40.000> Cliffjumper<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:41.440> shorter<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.480> know

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
height Cliffjumper is shorter you know

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.699 
height Cliffjumper is shorter you know
boom<00:03:44.140> B<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:45.040> much<00:03:45.549> taller<00:03:46.030> than

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
boom B is as much taller than

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.850 
boom B is as much taller than
Cliffjumper<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:49.390> kind<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.620> kind<00:03:50.799> of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
Cliffjumper it's kind of it's kind of

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.009 
Cliffjumper it's kind of it's kind of
strange<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.610> be<00:03:51.850> honest<00:03:52.299> because<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.810> thought

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
strange to be honest because you thought

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.289 
strange to be honest because you thought
it'll<00:03:53.200> be<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.410> same<00:03:53.650> figure<00:03:53.920> but<00:03:54.299> it's

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
it'll be the same figure but it's

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.819 
it'll be the same figure but it's
probably<00:03:55.690> because<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.170> head<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.709> know

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
probably because of the head you know

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.470 
probably because of the head you know
the<00:03:56.950> heads<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.519> bit<00:03:57.640> smaller<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.450> know

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
the heads a little bit smaller you know

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.330 
the heads a little bit smaller you know
because<00:03:58.840> that's<00:03:59.079> why<00:03:59.290> he's<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.829> short<00:04:00.130> guy

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
because that's why he's the short guy

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.780 
because that's why he's the short guy
usually<00:04:00.750> he's<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> short<00:04:02.200> guy<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:03.010> guy<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.310> but

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
usually he's a short guy this guy is but

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.210 
usually he's a short guy this guy is but
he's<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> short<00:04:04.510> guy<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.750> Optimus<00:04:05.590> Prime<00:04:05.920> but

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
he's a short guy with Optimus Prime but

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.170 
he's a short guy with Optimus Prime but
you<00:04:06.489> know<00:04:06.610> what<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.760> mean

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
you know what I mean

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.640 
you know what I mean
