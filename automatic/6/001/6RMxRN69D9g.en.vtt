 Miracle Information Center 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.100
 Speaker: Kenneth Hobnik 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 Mind and mind 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.100
 "The mind" is a concept that makes every miracle student feel a headache. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.300
 Even those who are only slightly exposed to the Course 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 Also inevitably have to encounter this difficult word 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
 The reason why it is difficult is because the "mind" that the course talks about does not mean the mind. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.100
 Researcher engaged in the theme of "mind and mind" 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.900
 The "heart" that is discussed almost refers to some part of the function of the brain. 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.500
 They think that the mind is a physiological organ 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
 And the mind is the activity of the mind, controlled by the mind. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.200
 Although you can't see it, you can determine its position in the brain. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 Therefore, the miracle student sees the "spirit" 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 Also used to understand in this way 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 Think of the mind as part of my physical and psychological structure 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.900
 This "I" is the one I see in the bathroom mirror after getting up every day. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000
 But the "spirit" in the course is not the meaning at all. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 But beyond time and space, before the world of time and space 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 Therefore, it does not belong to the category of time and space. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.900
 The mind is actually invisible 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.310
 People often ask: "Where is the heart?" This question seems reasonable. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.440
 There is no answer, because the concept of "location" does not apply here. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.400
 The mind does not exist anywhere and cannot be studied 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 Cannot be placed under the microscope for analysis 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 Can only be speculated by human behavior 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.300
 We may use the metaphor of "puppets and trainers" to illustrate 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 When we took the children to watch the puppet show, the adults knew that it was not a real person on the stage. 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 But the child thinks that the puppet really moves. 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.000
 Can talk, fight, love, etc. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.129
 Adults know that there is a person invisible to the audience who is maneuvering on stage or under the stage. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 Let the puppets live, the audience hears the voice of the couple 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.800
 Not the sound of the puppet itself 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.300
 It’s the trainer who decides what the puppet does and what to say. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 The audience saw that the puppet was talking, and the solid wood doll itself did nothing. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.200
 The same reason, the mind is the trainee 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.600
 Stealing behind the scenes commander, and the stage is our world and life 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.400
 The mind directs the body and orders the eyes to see how 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.500
 How do you hear your ears? 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.200
 So many places in the Course 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.300
 Including &lt;Text&gt;, &lt;Exercise Manual&gt; and &lt;Teacher Guide&gt; 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.200
 Said that the mind will not think, the eyes will not look, the ears will not listen 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.900
 The body does not feel, will not get sick or heal 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.000
 Will not be born or die, and will not make decisions for themselves. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.000
 Everything is done by the mind 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000
 We can’t directly understand the soul 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.700
 So Jesus is at the beginning of the 21st chapter of the text. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.000
 Say this important word to help us 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.400
 He says: 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.500
 "The world you see in front of you is the external appearance that describes your inner state." 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.500
 In other words, the world we see 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.100
 Relationship experienced (whether it is with the body of oneself) 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 Or the relationship with other bodies), the situation 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.000
 Even the physical life itself 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.500
 It’s just a projection of the decisions made by the mind. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.150
 The world you see is the external appearance that describes your inner state. 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.300
 The inner state refers to the state of decision 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.300
 So when I find myself angry, afraid, depressed or sick 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.200
 I asked Jesus for help. His answer would be: 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 "What you have experienced is the projection of the decisions made by your heart. 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.000
 If you experience the peace and joy of "completely accepting everyone", 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.000
 That's because your mind chose me as your teacher; 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.600
 Conversely, if you experience a gap with others, 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.300
 Feeling angry, sad, depressed, and other emotions, 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.800
 That's because your mind has chosen the ego. " 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.200
 This reply brings hope and helps us recognize: 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.000
 It turns out that I don't need to change the outer world. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 I just need to change my eyes on the world. 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 That is: Which teacher am I following? 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.500
 Who do I choose to see? 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.000
 My eyes will only see division and bring pain 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And the vision of the Holy Spirit, the wisdom of Christ 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.500
 Will transcend the level of the body and mind, bringing peace of mind 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.300
 Embrace everyone in the heart 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.000
