00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
few DC figures here and there but I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.839 
few DC figures here and there but I

Universe signature collection elastigirl

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.849 
Universe signature collection elastigirl
which<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.930> just<00:00:21.930> think<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.380> should<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.619> kept

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
which I just think they should have kept

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.500 
which I just think they should have kept
it<00:00:22.980> DC<00:00:23.460> Universe<00:00:23.850> Classics<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.420> know

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
it DC Universe Classics you know

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080 
it DC Universe Classics you know
whatever<00:00:24.869> um<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.130> either<00:00:26.340> two<00:00:26.609> signature

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
whatever um I don't either two signature

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.429 
whatever um I don't either two signature
collection<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:27.990> kind<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> stupid

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
collection I think it's kind of stupid

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.240 
collection I think it's kind of stupid
but<00:00:28.830> whatever<00:00:29.429> um<00:00:30.380> she<00:00:31.380> actually<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:31.980> scale

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
but whatever um she actually is in scale

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.500 
but whatever um she actually is in scale
very<00:00:32.489> nicely<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.910> course<00:00:32.940> she's<00:00:33.300> Elastigirl

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
very nicely of course she's Elastigirl

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
very nicely of course she's Elastigirl
she<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> grow<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.590> any<00:00:34.770> scale<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
she can grow in like any scale so that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
she can grow in like any scale so that
doesn't<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.390> matter<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.260> mean<00:00:37.410> she's

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
doesn't really matter but I mean she's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.850 
doesn't really matter but I mean she's
very<00:00:37.890> tall<00:00:38.329> much<00:00:39.329> taller<00:00:39.629> than<00:00:39.809> negative<00:00:40.710> man

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
very tall much taller than negative man

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
arms and the legs here because she does

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
arms and the legs here because she does
have<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.979> same<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> ball<00:01:29.700> joint<00:01:29.909> legs

have the same kind of a ball joint legs

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
have the same kind of a ball joint legs
that<00:01:30.420> Giganta<00:01:30.930> used<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.860> might<00:01:32.009> even<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that Giganta used and might even be the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.270
