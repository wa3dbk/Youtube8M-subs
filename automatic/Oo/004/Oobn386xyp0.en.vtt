00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 Yup 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.129
 outside of lawn 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.380
 certain irrigation returned this mine 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.080
 new video takes us into the twelfth 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.660
 episode interviews gtf xi are not 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.099
 certainly very safe and are almost magical ed 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.630
 yellow beautiful girl and today I took the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.280
 questions you asked me straight in 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.870
 yesterday and then on the facebook page 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.850
 also for the next time passes on 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 fan page that I always ask questions 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.680
 and nothing I would say that if he already knows it is ready 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.480
 we can also start 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.550
 the first question starts okay 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.199
 because you called yourself jean luc 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.109
 and then there is another one itself 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.989
 question because decision in 3 gts r 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.210
 then already lux is derived oh the part 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.750
 yellow from my name because my name is 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.339
 gianluca then to the z and because I am 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 fixed with ibrahimovic 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.550
 he is called zlatan l had omitted the z 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.560
 because the name originally was jean luc 9 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.930
 which was also the mere menu of football and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.360
 then I decided to keep this 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.670
 while I decided to enter gtf because 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.720
 since I had had problems with my own 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.900
 other clan 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.880
 I had untied it igt to be the only clan 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.710
 serious in Italy then share 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 so far as I am concerned, I have decided 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.670
 to enter 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.500
 ok the second question is a bit 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.260
 link to the latter true because 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.270
 left the bridge oils itf 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.480
 so I didn't really leave the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 oils because I was the boss and inside 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.320
 there were things about the clan that you didn't 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.740
 they went better they argued a little 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.840
 too then I decided to go out then 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.020
 a week later I decided to join it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.060
 gt is ok and the third question asks what it is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.330
 been your first code on which console 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.190
 you've played is what's your favorite 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.190
 then my first goal ever is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.069
 state mv due however is not online 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.410
 I played the campaign I started 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.720
 play online precisely because of this 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.030
 I really liked the campaigns I had 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 then signed up for xbox live 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.600
 I started playing on xbox 360 for 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.250
 play fifa 11 I remember and being 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.670
 which I really like the countryside 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.410
 I had preordered black ops 2 and ho 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 started playing multiplayer having 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.680
 also the online 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.320
 and then he started to like me 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.960
 initially it was a bit scarce but then 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.200
 let's say they have improved or now 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.160
 I'm here ok what is your favorite call 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 it's my favorite August club because 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.300
 I don't know, I find myself better for it too 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.850
 made of headphones that on two way not 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.560
 used me I find myself even better 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.700
 for the steps these things here the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.530
 competitive ok the fourth woman asks 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.120
 what do you think is the organized canape 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.240
 Italian apart gtf gods 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.190
 This is a bit difficult 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.140
 organization I think that's how it is 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.050
 in our clan for example a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.790
 video a day then zodiac knows that one 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.190
 very organized person does not come to me 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.700
 no clan in mind that has this 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 organization but it is very difficult 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.690
 answer this question 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.640
 oh well we say that there are not many 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.490
 klan in italy maybe I didn't follow them 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.840
 also how much more our own 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.640
 so I didn't know what to say not 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.740
 we say that there are not many 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.780
 organized we say only that there is not 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.700
 there are many and maybe they are also things 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.450
 large as if not america to be 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.569
 easily followed known here is the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.090
 fifth and last question makes us fight 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.610
 he asks us to tell us about the fountain 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.430
 I don't know anything about it then, this one 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.200
 here it will take a little longer because 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.410
 well my friends more than anything else 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.209
 break to tell her xbox me announcements 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.629
 when I went to do my first 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.940
 I left Milan and I am due 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.370
 stay there for two days so I am also 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.580
 met with a friend of mine from juve 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.200
 that greets him that he was the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 creator of this famous story of the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.239
 fountain because practically yes 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.700
 he was playing at three in the afternoon 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.460
 and then before we were around are 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.680
 went type in a park and there was one of 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.960
 those fountains that have two holes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.050
 so if you like under the water and from 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.250
 above was a dog he loved 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.990
 oh well then I diverted the jet 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.010
 of water to stop this dog that 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.470
 he didn't get it 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.780
 but my friend makes me look at the hole 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.960
 the one above the pressed fate has me 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.910
 splashed at me in the face and then nothing 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.510
 that's why they wanted me to have it 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.990
 talk about yourself even if it does a lot then 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.729
 to laugh 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:01.160
 he was a fool because it is stupid 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.260
