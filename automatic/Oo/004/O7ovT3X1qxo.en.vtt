00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
we're gonna finish breaking this path

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750 
we're gonna finish breaking this path
check<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> camera<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.590> then<00:03:10.250> we'll<00:03:10.400> see<00:03:10.580> we

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
check a camera and then we'll see we

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.340 
check a camera and then we'll see we
might<00:03:10.910> rake<00:03:11.150> one<00:03:11.360> going<00:03:11.570> east<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.870> west<00:03:12.080> but

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
might rake one going east and west but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:33.930 
might rake one going east and west but
this<00:03:13.160> stuff<00:03:13.400> sticking<00:03:13.820> here<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.270> don't<00:03:14.570> know

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.130 

while<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.269> mineral<00:03:35.629> site<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.019> I'm

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
while this is the mineral site that I'm

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.630 
while this is the mineral site that I'm
hopefully<00:03:36.470> going<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.680> get<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.830> few<00:03:37.010> pictures<00:03:37.310> up

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
hopefully going to get a few pictures up

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.940 
hopefully going to get a few pictures up
some<00:03:37.849> velvet<00:03:38.060> bucks<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.660> summer<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.709> just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
some velvet bucks this summer and I just

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.500 
some velvet bucks this summer and I just
actually<00:03:40.129> checked<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.670> camera<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.330> had<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
actually checked the camera and I had a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.690 
actually checked the camera and I had a
picture<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.049> kayo<00:03:42.430> literally<00:03:43.430> rolling

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
picture of a kayo literally rolling

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.539 
picture of a kayo literally rolling
around<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.360> mineral<00:03:44.690> site<00:03:44.930> here<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.549> what

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
around in the mineral site here and what

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.300 
around in the mineral site here and what
I<00:03:46.580> noticed<00:03:47.000> after<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.840> coyote<00:03:48.260> left<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.769> all

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
I noticed after that coyote left is all

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.280 
I noticed after that coyote left is all
the<00:03:49.340> deer<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.670> came<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.299> left<00:03:50.780> this<00:03:50.959> place

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the deer that came and left this place

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.170 
the deer that came and left this place
we're<00:03:51.590> real<00:03:51.830> cautious<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.670> few<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.030> did

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
we're real cautious the few that did

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.199 
we're real cautious the few that did
actually<00:03:53.390> come<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.819> one<00:03:55.819> thing<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.180> I

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
actually come in so one thing that I

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.180 
actually come in so one thing that I
always<00:03:56.420> do<00:03:56.690> when<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.870> check<00:03:57.319> when<00:03:57.530> i<00:03:57.560> refresh

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
always do when I check when i refresh

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.949 
always do when I check when i refresh
these<00:03:58.519> mineral<00:03:58.910> sites<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.420> bring<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.720> little

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
these mineral sites is I bring a little

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.979 
these mineral sites is I bring a little
garden<00:04:00.319> rake<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.220> rake<00:04:01.459> up<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> soil<00:04:02.030> just

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
garden rake and I rake up the soil just

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.839 
garden rake and I rake up the soil just
to<00:04:03.140> loosen<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.560> up<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.799> little<00:04:03.890> bit<00:04:04.160> since<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
to loosen it up a little bit since the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.300 
to loosen it up a little bit since the
mineral<00:04:05.209> here<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.720> soak<00:04:05.959> into<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.349> ground<00:04:07.160> a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
mineral here can soak into the ground a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.550 
mineral here can soak into the ground a
little<00:04:07.430> bit<00:04:07.579> easier<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.840> what<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.379> also

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
little bit easier so what I'm also

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.770 
little bit easier so what I'm also
hoping<00:04:10.099> given<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:10.910> coyotes<00:04:11.450> been<00:04:11.660> in

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
hoping given that that coyotes been in

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.229 
hoping given that that coyotes been in
here<00:04:12.079> I'm<00:04:12.500> hoping<00:04:12.890> loosening<00:04:13.760> up<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:14.030> soil

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
here I'm hoping loosening up the soil

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.449 
here I'm hoping loosening up the soil
and<00:04:14.420> kind<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.780> turning<00:04:15.079> it<00:04:15.140> over<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.680> going<00:04:16.400> to

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
and kind of turning it over is going to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.150 
and kind of turning it over is going to
not<00:04:17.239> totally<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:18.109> away<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.530> scent<00:04:18.950> but

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
not totally do away with that scent but

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.039 
not totally do away with that scent but
I<00:04:19.190> hope<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:19.579> going<00:04:19.699> to<00:04:19.760> help<00:04:20.269> eliminate<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.989> a

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
I hope it's going to help eliminate it a

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.219 
I hope it's going to help eliminate it a
little<00:04:21.260> bit<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.160> I'm<00:04:22.400> gonna<00:04:22.490> rake<00:04:22.699> this<00:04:22.910> up

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
little bit so I'm gonna rake this up

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.170 
little bit so I'm gonna rake this up
pour<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:24.410> on<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.830> then<00:04:25.220> we'll<00:04:25.370> put<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.729> put<00:04:26.150> a

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
pour this on it then we'll put the put a

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.490 
pour this on it then we'll put the put a
new<00:04:26.330> card<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.750> camera<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.139> get<00:04:27.260> out<00:04:27.380> of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
new card in the camera and get out of

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.890 
new card in the camera and get out of
here

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.909 

now<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:38.960> last<00:04:39.290> thing<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.650> we're<00:04:39.770> going<00:04:39.860> to

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
now the last thing that we're going to

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.710 
now the last thing that we're going to
do<00:04:40.100> here<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.430> rake<00:04:40.639> a<00:04:40.669> path<00:04:41.000> from<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.479> logging

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
do here is rake a path from the logging

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.170 
do here is rake a path from the logging
road<00:04:42.050> going<00:04:42.710> east<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.250> west<00:04:43.460> we're<00:04:43.790> in<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.910> pine

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
road going east and west we're in a pine

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.540 
road going east and west we're in a pine
bottom<00:04:44.660> here<00:04:44.900> there's<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.620> hardwood<00:04:45.979> Ridge<00:04:46.250> and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
bottom here there's a hardwood Ridge and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.700 
bottom here there's a hardwood Ridge and
the<00:04:46.970> deer<00:04:47.180> funneled<00:04:47.600> through<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.260> I

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
the deer funneled through this and I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.740 
the deer funneled through this and I
don't<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.669> permission<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.120> hunt<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:50.479> Ridge

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
don't have permission to hunt that Ridge

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.409 
don't have permission to hunt that Ridge
but<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:52.100> deer<00:04:52.310> definitely<00:04:52.760> come<00:04:52.940> off<00:04:53.120> at<00:04:53.300> and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
but the deer definitely come off at and

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.390 
but the deer definitely come off at and
funneled<00:04:53.720> through<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:54.020> pine<00:04:54.320> bottom<00:04:54.800> so

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
funneled through this pine bottom so

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.040 
funneled through this pine bottom so
we're<00:04:55.490> going<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.639> rake<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> path<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.510> make<00:04:56.870> it

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
we're going to rake a path to make it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.330 
we're going to rake a path to make it
easier<00:04:57.350> for<00:04:57.500> them<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.740> get<00:04:57.860> through<00:04:58.040> all<00:04:58.190> this

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
easier for them and get through all this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.370 
easier for them and get through all this
thick<00:04:58.580> vegetation<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.600> hopefully<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.290> will

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
thick vegetation and hopefully that will

00:05:00.380 --> 00:06:07.170 
thick vegetation and hopefully that will
pay<00:05:00.530> off<00:05:00.680> this<00:05:00.919> fall

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.670 

well<00:06:08.180> that's<00:06:08.449> going<00:06:08.629> to<00:06:08.720> do<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:08.960> for<00:06:09.139> today<00:06:09.440> and

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
well that's going to do it for today and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.980 
well that's going to do it for today and
like<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.669> said<00:06:10.729> these<00:06:11.060> are<00:06:11.120> just<00:06:11.300> projects<00:06:11.900> that

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
like I said these are just projects that

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.779 
like I said these are just projects that
you<00:06:12.080> can<00:06:12.259> do<00:06:12.349> anywhere<00:06:12.740> I'm<00:06:13.340> hunting<00:06:13.699> on

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
you can do anywhere I'm hunting on

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.820
