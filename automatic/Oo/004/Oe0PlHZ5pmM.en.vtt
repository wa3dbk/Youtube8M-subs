00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
what a glorious day just the kind of day

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
what a glorious day just the kind of day
you<00:00:27.779> would<00:00:28.170> want<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> spend<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> big

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you would want to spend out on a big

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
you would want to spend out on a big
porch<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.510> well<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> porch<00:00:31.470> has

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
porch like this well the porch has

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.610 
porch like this well the porch has
gotten<00:00:31.859> larger<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:34.079> eight<00:00:34.260> feet

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
gotten larger it was only eight feet

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.299 
gotten larger it was only eight feet
from<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> house<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.300> point<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.309> this

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
from the house to this point and this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
from the house to this point and this
finished<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.120> material<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:39.750> pull<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
finished for material I'll pull back you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.130 
finished for material I'll pull back you
can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:41.340> added<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:41.730> four<00:00:42.270> feet<00:00:42.300> onto

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
can see we added another four feet onto

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
can see we added another four feet onto
the<00:00:43.469> deck<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.579> give<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.899> room

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the deck to give it well just more room

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.459 
the deck to give it well just more room
and<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> reason<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.480> porch<00:00:48.809> feels<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.350> much

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and the reason this porch feels so much

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
and the reason this porch feels so much
smaller<00:00:49.829> than<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> front<00:00:50.340> porch<00:00:50.640> because

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
smaller than the front porch because

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
smaller than the front porch because
they're<00:00:51.000> essentially<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> same<00:00:51.690> size<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
they're essentially the same size and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
they're essentially the same size and
front<00:00:52.530> porch<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.070> longer<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
front porch is a little longer the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
front porch is a little longer the
chimney<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.809> interrupts<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> space

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
chimney actually interrupts this space

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
chimney actually interrupts this space
quite<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> makes<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> feel<00:00:57.989> much

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
quite a bit and makes it feel much

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.880 
quite a bit and makes it feel much
smaller<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> plan<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.739> come<00:01:01.739> out

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
smaller so the plan here is to come out

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
smaller so the plan here is to come out
to<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> point<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.840> posts<00:01:04.379> will

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to this point here with some posts will

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
to this point here with some posts will
have<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> covered<00:01:05.760> porch<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.720> here

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
have a covered porch and then from here

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
have a covered porch and then from here
out<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.409> will<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.650> uncovered<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.400> there'll<00:01:08.610> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
out it will be uncovered but there'll be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
out it will be uncovered but there'll be
a<00:01:08.729> rail<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> look<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a rail there now take a look at the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
a rail there now take a look at the
floor<00:01:10.920> joists<00:01:11.250> tony<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.450> together

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
floor joists tony has put these together

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830 
floor joists tony has put these together
with<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.680> x<00:01:13.830> 12<00:01:14.250> material<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
with two x 12 material so it's really

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.780 
with two x 12 material so it's really
solid<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.530> supported<00:01:16.979> by<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.189> concrete

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
solid and supported by our concrete

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
solid and supported by our concrete
block<00:01:18.210> pillars<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> finished<00:01:19.830> floor

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
block pillars so the finished floor

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
block pillars so the finished floor
material<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
material is is this it's a really a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.690 
material is is this it's a really a
1-inch<00:01:23.610> thick<00:01:23.700> board<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> rounded

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
1-inch thick board that has a rounded

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.740 
1-inch thick board that has a rounded
edge<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.900> either<00:01:28.020> side<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
edge on either side here and here and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
edge on either side here and here and
it's<00:01:30.750> six<00:01:31.259> inches<00:01:31.590> wide<00:01:31.860> these<00:01:32.520> boards<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.090> 16

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's six inches wide these boards are 16

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.859 
it's six inches wide these boards are 16
feet<00:01:33.900> long<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.060> buy<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.540> limp

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
feet long so you can buy on that limp

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.340 
feet long so you can buy on that limp
and<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.400> placed<00:01:39.329> side<00:01:39.840> by<00:01:39.869> side

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and these will be placed side by side

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
and these will be placed side by side
there's<00:01:40.560> still<00:01:40.710> quite<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.189> moisture<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
there's still quite a bit of moisture in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
there's still quite a bit of moisture in
these<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.240> he's<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> pack<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.470> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
these so he's going to pack them in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.219 
these so he's going to pack them in
really<00:01:44.189> close<00:01:44.340> together<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:45.810> against<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
really close together one against the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
really close together one against the
other<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:47.759> dry<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.930> get

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
other and then as they dry you'll get

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
other and then as they dry you'll get
about<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.350> quarter<00:01:49.740> inch<00:01:49.770> gap<00:01:50.250> between<00:01:50.610> these

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
about a quarter inch gap between these

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
about a quarter inch gap between these
but<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> put<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> gap<00:01:52.320> between<00:01:52.530> them

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
but if you put a gap between them

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
but if you put a gap between them
starting<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.630> shrunk<00:01:55.020> you're

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
starting out and then they shrunk you're
