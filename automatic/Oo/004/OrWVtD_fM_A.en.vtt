00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 between then president tells me 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.650
 calculate the expression 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:21.000
 the expression wounds extremely 0.2 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 the respective pathway 199 days abc7 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.460
 We were lying on the street because we visited the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.460
 key 11 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:40.590
 then observe 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.220
 that both numbers are sensible decimals 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.840
 I'll arrange it vertically 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:56.940
 0.25 we're going to cut it 0.25 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 + 0 2 to 0 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.710
 good young people 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.960
 obviously apart from final I have nothing 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 in the second depression but complete it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 with zero or zero to add 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.680
 very careful correct inside 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.710
 keeping in mind they have the sessions 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 previous 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 but after the figures 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 two 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.830
 0 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.830
 conclusion 02 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 Right 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.579
 the 505 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.409
 224 by a comma previously to 0 the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.739
 result of the sum 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.319
 I find it 0.45 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.690
 I will convert this result to your 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.230
 fraction in era Chris our has the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.890
 key 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.230
 they give me everything depending on functions 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:32.489
 correct generatrices said article 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.489
 fast from 0.5 equals 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:48.140
 5 we will live between 1 followed by 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.140
 as many zeros as 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.030
 2 to 2 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.599
 by zero 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.570
 9 we will work 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.570
 9 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:21.620
 and fifth of 100 of it comes to be from 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:26.650
 we get from having rotated we say the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:31.430
 0.45 generation ration 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:44.650
 and therefore we put that the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:44.650
 answer the answer is going to be key 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 9 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.530
 let's see a second example 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.170
 to see in the second example tells me 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:11.099
 calculate the expression to which there are 925 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.099
 more 0.25 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.700
 his respective went through the key to 27 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:22.760
 fifth 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.760
 95 thirds keys in themselves 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.210
 four fifths and pressure 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.670
 0 30 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:53.090
 finally 00 seen more and more 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.280
 from zero equals 0 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:14.030
 young people 55 10 insurance in 12 33 13 17 10 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.990
 on that same vertical line 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.430
 adding up to serve 20 in 0 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.129
 I have the conclusion all this impression 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.699
 as a result 2 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:34.860
 now I go to the abduction of a prince 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:38.500
 we say that 2.70 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.250
 is equivalent to causing depression where 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.250
 only here 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:54.480
 270 divided by 1 follower of so many 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.470
 zeros as a dismantling figure observable 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:04.130
 of two main figures therefore 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.130
 26 10 2009 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.940
 finally finally the 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.060
 fraction 27 6 10 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.060
 Y 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.160
 in that problem 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.060
 and observe 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.129
 good guys is what you have to do 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.469
 me in every way 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.219
 we are going to apply to complete 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.219
 corrective
