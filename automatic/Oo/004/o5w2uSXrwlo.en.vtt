plastic other than that I hate this cage
um<00:01:52.289> I<00:01:53.289> don't<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:53.920> using<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.340> word<00:01:54.549> hate<00:01:54.759> very

often<00:01:55.329> but<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.899> think<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.289> cruel<00:01:56.649> to

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
often but I just think it is cruel to

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.099 
often but I just think it is cruel to
keep<00:01:57.069> your<00:01:57.249> hamster<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.029> cage<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.509> I

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
keep your hamster in this cage and I

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.340 
keep your hamster in this cage and I
think<00:01:59.380> all<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.649> us<00:02:00.039> can<00:02:00.369> agree<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.719> too

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
think all of us can agree this is too

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.139 
think all of us can agree this is too
small<00:02:03.039> for<00:02:03.520> any<00:02:03.849> small<00:02:04.539> animal<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.529> think<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
small for any small animal I think this

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.270 
small for any small animal I think this
is<00:02:07.329> animal<00:02:07.719> cruelty<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.319> keep<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.709> your<00:02:09.039> cage

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
is animal cruelty to keep this your cage

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600 
is animal cruelty to keep this your cage
and<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:10.149> can<00:02:10.360> survive<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:11.140> small<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:12.459> your
