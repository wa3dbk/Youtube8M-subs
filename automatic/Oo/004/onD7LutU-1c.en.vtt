00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
alchemist like myself I'm an engineer

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.939 
alchemist like myself I'm an engineer
minor<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:30.480> would<00:00:30.599> allow<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> drop<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.859> of

minor it would allow them to drop one of
their<00:00:32.040> professions<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:33.090> alchemy<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.690> level

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
their professions get alchemy at level

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.190 
their professions get alchemy at level
one<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:35.989> open<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.170> few<00:00:37.550> move<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.640> here

canopic jars what with their skill level
one<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> alchemy<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.789> just

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
one of alchemy to see if they can just

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
one of alchemy to see if they can just
get<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> recipe<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.379> without<00:00:46.590> having

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
get the recipe you know without having

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
get the recipe you know without having
to<00:00:47.160> level<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.120> whole<00:00:48.300> nother<00:00:48.480> profession

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to level up a whole nother profession

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
to level up a whole nother profession
and<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.829> my

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and so what I've got here is I in my

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
and so what I've got here is I in my
case<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> drop<00:00:53.610> mining<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
case I'm going to drop mining and then

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
case I'm going to drop mining and then
I'm<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.260> alchemy<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.039> solve<00:00:56.940> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I'm going to get alchemy and solve this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
I'm going to get alchemy and solve this
first<00:00:57.690> artifact<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> canopic<00:00:58.890> jar

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
first artifact which is a canopic jar

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
first artifact which is a canopic jar
and<00:01:00.949> then<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.270> you'll

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and then if you look down here you'll

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
and then if you look down here you'll
see<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.320> accumulated<00:01:05.000> 195

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
see that I have accumulated 195

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560 
see that I have accumulated 195
fragments<00:01:06.830> from<00:01:07.830> polvere<00:01:08.189> sites<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.360> max

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
fragments from polvere sites and the max

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
fragments from polvere sites and the max
is<00:01:09.720> 200<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> reason<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
is 200 and the reason for this is that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
is 200 and the reason for this is that
when<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.270> drop<00:01:12.540> mining<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.380> alchemy<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:14.100> will<00:01:14.670> be

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
when i drop mining get alchemy i will be

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
when i drop mining get alchemy i will be
able<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.360> solve<00:01:16.070> multiple<00:01:17.070> toll<00:01:17.490> beer

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
able to solve multiple toll beer

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020 
able to solve multiple toll beer
artifacts<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.420> hopes<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> i<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> few<00:01:20.850> more

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
artifacts in hopes that i get a few more

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.109 
artifacts in hopes that i get a few more
canopic<00:01:21.420> jars<00:01:21.689> while<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.229> alchemy<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.220> i

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
canopic jars while I have alchemy and i

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.200 
canopic jars while I have alchemy and i
also<00:01:25.009> got<00:01:26.009> real<00:01:26.250> lucky<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.880> able<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.150> get

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
also got real lucky and was able to get

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.870 
also got real lucky and was able to get
11<00:01:27.780> hieroglyphics<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:28.950> saving<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
11 hieroglyphics well saving up the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
11 hieroglyphics well saving up the
fragments<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.600> hopefully<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.590> some

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
fragments so hopefully I get some

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.130 
fragments so hopefully I get some
mileage<00:01:32.100> out<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.880> ok<00:01:33.630> so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
mileage out of that ok so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.320 
mileage out of that ok so
