job<00:01:58.880> just<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.510> it's<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.840> simple<00:02:00.170> very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
job just like that it's very simple very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.290 
job just like that it's very simple very
easy<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:01.010> do<00:02:01.190> then<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.030> take<00:02:02.240> your

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
easy to do then you take your

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.220 
easy to do then you take your
ingredients<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.280> kale<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.230> silver

be<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.980> may<00:02:07.160> just<00:02:07.370> want<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.700> tear<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.060> up<00:02:08.150> so

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
be you may just want to tear it up so

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.880 
be you may just want to tear it up so
I'm<00:02:08.510> going<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> spring<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.230> against<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.710> side

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
I'm going to spring up against the side

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.490 
I'm going to spring up against the side
of<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.160> jar<00:02:10.630> will<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.750> easier<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.170> process

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
of the jar will be easier to process

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.470 
of the jar will be easier to process
where<00:02:13.070> they'll<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.680> throw<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.740> your

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
where they'll just do that throw in your

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.330 
where they'll just do that throw in your
celery<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.110> might<00:02:18.320> want<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.680> might<00:02:19.040> want<00:02:19.280> to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
celery you might want to might want to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.760 
celery you might want to might want to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
do that to decide sits down make it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010 
do that to decide sits down make it
easier<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
easier to do it a little bit of the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.620 
easier to do it a little bit of the
silver<00:02:24.980> bit<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.930> well<00:02:27.400> similar<00:02:28.400> thing<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:31.630> pop
