00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello on the internet I have in vain 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.889
 after a German 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 the nikon 18 to 35 wanted possible in the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.350
 compared to nikon 14 to 24 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.980
 since I did not find anything and now 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.910
 both objective reasons are because of one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.440
 small preview of more 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 the nikon 18 to 35 is quite small it 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.300
 is featherweight that means you can do it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.129
 very good incidentally as a second objective 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.190
 take it with you without taking your bag 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.700
 too much burden on the one objective 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 filter thread of 77 mm 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.390
 that means you can easily do it all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 unscrew a possible filter, which is clear 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.899
 Polfilter in blue sky and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.040
 super wide angle that does not come so well 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.320
 but when it comes to any 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.059
 one wants to do away with mirroring 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.189
 Maybe that's more often 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.719
 to be able to put on a filter 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.850
 also on his super wide angle 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:15.630
 Objective here has a rubber lip metal 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 bayonet is so at least a little bit 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 This is nikon 14 to 24 sealed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.850
 in weight felt like a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.240
 brick so it weighs a lot 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 the small 18 to 35 it is natural 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.990
 Much better made of metal and has 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 due to the curved lens a firm 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.860
 built-in protection is not here 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.750
 can be removed 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.290
 and no filter can be screwed on 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.049
 become 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 Although there are a few solutions but 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.110
 very expensive here are also a filter 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270
 to use 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.150
 let's see how good the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.119
 Image quality of the two is objective 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.700
 I have that only relatively quickly 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.470
 photographed me out of the window that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.500
 there should be no photography channel here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.940
 it is just for someone 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.650
 who cares 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.910
 he might look at her like that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.360
 we first a focal length 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.090
 comparison 14 millimeter focal length 1 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.880
 but clearly more detail 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.060
 and image angle as here 18 millimeters at 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.160
 nikon 18 to 35 so from the picture quality 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.410
 now for the 14th to 24th 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.830
 the 14 24 is a little sharper here 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 100% cutout from the roof right above the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.129
 nikon 14 to 24 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.150
 and here's the 18 to 35 a bit 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:00.930
 blurred so the objective but I have 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.360
 times tested with polfilter no 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.700
 shading now with two filters out there 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.099
 It's a little budgeting on the top right 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.790
 but by a click on the 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:15.680
 Objective profile correction in camera raw 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.680
 can be eliminated directly 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.519
 image quality in terms of weight but also 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.540
 in terms of price, that nikon 18 to 35 is 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.140
 significantly cheaper 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.190
 It's as light as a feather you can filter 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.620
 use and it has a good one 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.720
 to very good picture quality yes what 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.849
 for me my personal conclusion is 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.879
 that 14 to 24 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.550
 is just so high in weight that 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.830
 not be there 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.250
 always the whole day on vacation with you 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.770
 would like to lug around 18 to 35 like that 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.250
 feather light that does not fall on when 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.360
 It is also still in a bag 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:10.260
 and you can use children so for 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.620
 me an objective that I do not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.150
 Everyone wants to be able to do it, of course 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.560
 decide for yourself who 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.960
 someone has quality claims 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.170
 really high quality standards 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.030
 then the 18 32 may not be him 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.550
 then he should be enough 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.920
 take directory 24 and look for the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 ground weight and unusable 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:46.660
 okay, that's as I said 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.920
 Here is a video channel in which I only foto 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.760
 to test things 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.790
 I'm just concerned with me 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:59.290
 my experiences with the objective for 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.900
 I would like to provide others 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.570
 have found nothing on German who's 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.640
 I like it wonderful we do not like it 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.640
 I'm not okay
