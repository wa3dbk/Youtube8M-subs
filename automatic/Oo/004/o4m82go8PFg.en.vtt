and being able to really raise a family

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.240 
and being able to really raise a family
in<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:44.060> simple<00:01:44.420> way<00:01:44.679> when<00:01:45.679> I<00:01:45.710> walk<00:01:45.920> out<00:01:46.069> in<00:01:46.219> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
in a simple way when I walk out in the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.949 
in a simple way when I walk out in the
pasture<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.729> I'm<00:01:46.969> around<00:01:47.179> battle<00:01:47.659> like<00:01:47.929> this

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
grazing peacefully behind me and I think

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.169 
grazing peacefully behind me and I think
of<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.229> days<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.920> used<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.310> spend<00:01:52.609> in<00:01:52.729> an<00:01:52.819> office

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
of the days I used to spend in an office

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.480 
of the days I used to spend in an office
and<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:53.390> big<00:01:53.599> tall<00:01:53.990> building<00:01:54.469> there's<00:01:55.340> no

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and a big tall building there's no

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.319 
and a big tall building there's no
comparison<00:01:55.849> this<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.509> much<00:01:56.780> better<00:01:56.990> life
