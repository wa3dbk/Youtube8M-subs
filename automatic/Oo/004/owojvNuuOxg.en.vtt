00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
frame and make sure it's a keyframe and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.500 
frame and make sure it's a keyframe and
try<00:00:23.760> any<00:00:25.130> object<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.760> image<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.240> you

with your pencil tool metamodeling I'm
going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.570> your<00:02:31.750> path

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
going to do that now this is your path

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.410 
going to do that now this is your path
that<00:02:32.410> it's<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.800> follow<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.489> it's<00:02:34.209> not

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that it's going to follow and it's not

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.970 
that it's going to follow and it's not
actually<00:02:34.840> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.140> appear<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.739> screen

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
actually going to appear on the screen

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.210 
actually going to appear on the screen
it's<00:02:36.489> just<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:37.060> guide<00:02:37.620> now<00:02:38.620> go<00:02:38.800> back<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.010> your

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
it's just a guide now go back to your

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.699 
it's just a guide now go back to your
layer<00:02:39.550> 1<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.180> highlight<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.930> first<00:02:41.170> keyframe

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
layer 1 and highlight the first keyframe

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.850 
layer 1 and highlight the first keyframe
as<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:44.230> detonate<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.670> path<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:47.590> go<00:02:47.799> to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
as you detonate of the path now go to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.699 
as you detonate of the path now go to
your<00:02:48.040> last<00:02:48.430> keyframe<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.329> layer<00:02:49.540> 1<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.079> as

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
your last keyframe and layer 1 and as

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.020 
your last keyframe and layer 1 and as
you<00:02:50.950> set<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:54.640> layer

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you set it up so now we have layer

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.600 
you set it up so now we have layer
number<00:02:55.299> one<00:02:55.660> keyframe<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.890> layer<00:02:57.040> number<00:02:57.280> one

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
number one keyframe and layer number one

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.569 
number one keyframe and layer number one
make<00:02:57.970> sure<00:02:58.000> you're<00:02:58.269> not<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.630> your<00:02:58.750> guide<00:02:58.989> layer

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
make sure you're not in your guide layer

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.630 
make sure you're not in your guide layer
in<00:03:00.579> keyframe<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.420> layer<00:03:01.840> number<00:03:02.230> two<00:03:03.540> now<00:03:04.540> as

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
in keyframe and layer number two now as

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.780 
in keyframe and layer number two now as
you<00:03:06.640> see<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.540> now<00:03:07.750> have<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:08.079> path<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.799> when<00:03:09.610> we

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
you see we now have a path and when we

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.979 
you see we now have a path and when we
press<00:03:10.060> Enter<00:03:10.510> our<00:03:10.829> object<00:03:11.829> now<00:03:12.640> follows<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
press Enter our object now follows that

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.400 
press Enter our object now follows that
guide<00:03:14.350> layer

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370 

so<00:03:18.410> remember<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.550> make<00:03:19.790> your<00:03:20.690> guide<00:03:20.990> in<00:03:21.319> your

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
so remember you make your guide in your

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.120 
so remember you make your guide in your
guide<00:03:21.740> later<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.569> snap<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:23.990> in<00:03:24.350> on<00:03:24.770> layer

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
guide later and you snap it in on layer

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.199 
guide later and you snap it in on layer
number<00:03:25.520> one<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.890> let's<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.280> how<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.700> looks

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
number one so let's see how this looks

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.699 
number one so let's see how this looks
like<00:03:29.420> if<00:03:29.720> we're<00:03:30.170> actually<00:03:30.830> test<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.490> as<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
like if we're actually test it as you

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.240 
like if we're actually test it as you
can<00:03:33.830> see<00:03:34.540> when<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.660> actually<00:03:35.840> shows<00:03:36.560> our<00:03:36.920> guide

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
can see when it actually shows our guide

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.280 
can see when it actually shows our guide
layer<00:03:37.520> doesn't<00:03:38.030> show<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.690> our<00:03:38.840> basketball

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
layer doesn't show and our basketball

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.580 
layer doesn't show and our basketball
appears<00:03:39.950> be<00:03:40.700> bouncing<00:03:41.209> along<00:03:41.420> whatever<00:03:42.020> path

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
appears be bouncing along whatever path

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.059 
appears be bouncing along whatever path
we<00:03:42.890> made<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.930> how<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.290> can<00:03:45.680> make<00:03:45.860> a

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
we made and this is how you can make a

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.090 
we made and this is how you can make a
motion<00:03:46.400> layer<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.270> move<00:03:47.510> your<00:03:48.140> objects<00:03:48.680> along

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
motion layer to move your objects along

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.810 
motion layer to move your objects along
any<00:03:49.370> line<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:50.269> isn't<00:03:50.450> straight<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.820> next

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
any line that isn't straight and next

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.130 
any line that isn't straight and next
time<00:03:52.940> we're<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.360> be<00:03:53.480> talking<00:03:53.690> more

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
time we're going to be talking more

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.810 
time we're going to be talking more
about<00:03:54.200> animation<00:03:55.100> but<00:03:55.400> if<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.610> missed

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
about animation but if you missed
