that seat is close enough to the

close that he sweats in the summer it's

close that he sweats in the summer it's

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
angle that isn't direct so we can still

angle that isn't direct so we can still
talk<00:06:12.129> to<00:06:12.370> everybody<00:06:12.729> yet<00:06:12.909> that's<00:06:13.089> so<00:06:13.389> wide
