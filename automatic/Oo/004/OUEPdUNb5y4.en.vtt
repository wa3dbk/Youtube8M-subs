 hide the identity of the hero but 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.640
 emphasize individuality 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.440
 most of the characters you can find out

 You can find many different masks. 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.570
 this is one of the masks of the dragon priests 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.399
 which can be collected if there are 8 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.440

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.910

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
 dragons greeted magic masks 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.619

 the guy would die of septic shock 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.720
 maybe many options seem 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.330
 absurd but the real option is much 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.160
 hides scars from childhood although the mantis itself 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.900
