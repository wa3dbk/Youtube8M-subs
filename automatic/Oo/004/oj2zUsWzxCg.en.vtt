00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.229
 Hi all 

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.820
 the other time I was surfing the internet and I found an article 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.199
 that follows the 'lost episode of tom and jerry 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:14.009
 the thirteen short films of tom and jerry formulated by the Czech director only 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.920
 going to catch doctors are famous for their poor quality and nature caturla dollar 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.329
 with lousy sound effects and even worse animation 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.310
 and have a more realistic sense of violence 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.780
 some speculate that ruiz did not like the concept of the program and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.670
 created these chapters so that people will not like it either 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.040
 what many people do not know is that phillips originally signed for 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.090
 make more of the 13 episodes the public has access 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.130
 desperate to get out of his contract he actually made a shorter one of tom and jerry 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.380
 that few have seen 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.360
 the short was called thomis basement 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.440
 it opened with take a typical house of tom and jerry 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.110
 its owner was the rabid fat of other hits shorts 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.400
 he seemed even more angry than in his last appearances the first 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.370
 scene is seen stomping on Tom's tail in a way 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.480
 is realistic and sadistic for the fifth month late member at the door of the sun 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.710
 Charles 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.050
 the owner shouts at tom that he never 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.550
 due to the basement 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.160
 Tom is clearly terrified and escapes to another room 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 our point of view remains in the room by the door of the sun we will both go 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.070
 to jerome out of a mouse cave 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.010
 in it it looks really grotesque much more different from the original than in other 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 short rights 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.110
 responds to a devilish look on his face and remains atom in the room 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.400
 next to 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 the following minutes are quite realistic 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.470
 Tom chases Jerry around the house like he usually does 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 but every time he goes through the door of the sun when the owner inflicts a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.240
 wound with a stick does these three times until trump ends up bleeding 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.580
 in several places and with a broken leg 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.499
 after that 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:13.409
 literally to jerry it does not bother him anymore he does not really walk but he 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.909
 is crying 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.969
 I entered clients and you can say what you are doing for your language 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.299
 bodily 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.589
 jerry just laughs at him and what 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.659
 bid back to the door of the sun bed 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.489
 the owner captures tom again and gets angry 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.319
 the camera zooms in on its face that changes color and distorts with what 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.610
 he yells atom with a voice much louder than any other sound in the 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.879
 cartoon 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.909
 but it is definitely vicious and furious 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.790
 it seems that geli has decided final 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.519
 Actively give it to her 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.729
 Jerry Catching a knife that was out there was stabbed owner 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.799
 in the leg very graphically 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.279
 taken from the door of the sun both carries the owner's body and threw it down 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.949
 the stairs 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.139
 there are dozens of other bodies down there in decay and with signs of 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.709
 violent death 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.469
 Tom and Jerry shake hands and it seems that now 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.949
 asked about the bad of the episode 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.599
 there is a deformed and devilish face again and di giacomo 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.969
 With a ghostly voice do not trust anyone 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.479
 Jerry Kills has taken stabs and threw her body into the pile 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.340
 in the last scene you see gerbi planting a poster of sold in the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.659
 patio of the house with intent to do it all over again
