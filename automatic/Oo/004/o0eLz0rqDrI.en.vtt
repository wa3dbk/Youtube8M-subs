probably will though I mean he's so far
behind<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.320> gas<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> may<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.250> do

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
behind in gas you may like I actually do

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.639 
behind in gas you may like I actually do
stuff<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:38.880> he<00:01:39.030> may<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.780> assuming<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> I'm

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
stuff like he may be assuming that I'm

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.020 
stuff like he may be assuming that I'm
what<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.160> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> hide

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
what I'm going to do actually is hide

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510

all<00:01:42.149> my<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.750> stalkers<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
all my my stalkers now and some of my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
all my my stalkers now and some of my
gas<00:01:44.790> units<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.810> back<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.410> wanted<00:01:46.679> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
gas units way back here I wanted to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.320 
gas units way back here I wanted to
think<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.160> don't<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.459> that<00:01:47.580> many<00:01:47.819> units

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
think that I don't have that many units

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.249 
think that I don't have that many units
there<00:01:48.660> that<00:01:48.840> much<00:01:49.020> spent<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.500> gas<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:52.140> him

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
there that much spent on gas I want him

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.010 
there that much spent on gas I want him
to<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.410> I'm<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.740> colossi<00:01:53.250> basically<00:01:57.020> so

you know that's too bad you know
obviously<00:04:25.150> he<00:04:25.479> didn't<00:04:25.630> want<00:04:25.750> get<00:04:25.840> embarrassed

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
obviously he didn't want get embarrassed

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.590 
obviously he didn't want get embarrassed
you<00:04:27.640> know<00:04:27.669> there's<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> observer<00:04:28.419> right

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
you know there's the observer right

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.250 
you know there's the observer right
there<00:04:29.190> it's<00:04:30.190> like<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.340> saw<00:04:30.490> an<00:04:30.550> observer

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
there it's like I saw an observer

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.230 
there it's like I saw an observer
anyways<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.890> doesn't<00:04:33.580> matter<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:33.940> just

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
anyways you know doesn't matter I just

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.730 
anyways you know doesn't matter I just
need<00:04:34.360> vortex

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.770 

you<00:04:40.490> know<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.639> probably<00:04:41.210> should<00:04:41.449> wait<00:04:41.630> to

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
you know I probably should wait to

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.779 
you know I probably should wait to
attack<00:04:42.020> until<00:04:42.319> have<00:04:42.530> more<00:04:42.710> text<00:04:43.039> but<00:04:43.220> um

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.430 

vortex<00:04:46.789> would<00:04:46.910> be<00:04:47.000> really<00:04:47.330> good<00:04:47.599> I<00:04:47.840> mean<00:04:48.020> I'm

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
vortex would be really good I mean I'm

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.080 
vortex would be really good I mean I'm
just<00:04:48.500> gonna<00:04:48.710> wait<00:04:48.860> wait<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.310> out<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.819> he<00:04:49.970> now

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
just gonna wait wait it out like he now

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.730 
just gonna wait wait it out like he now
knows<00:04:50.240> i<00:04:50.419> have<00:04:50.539> this<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.990> mean<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.229> you<00:04:51.380> know<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.620> I

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
knows i have this I mean I you know I I

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.520 
knows i have this I mean I you know I I
should<00:04:52.099> I<00:04:52.220> should<00:04:52.280> have<00:04:52.550> talked<00:04:52.729> just<00:04:52.880> in<00:04:53.030> case

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
should I should have talked just in case

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.809 
should I should have talked just in case
okay<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.770> now<00:04:55.190> see<00:04:55.460> what<00:04:55.550> he's<00:04:55.669> got<00:04:55.819> um<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:57.819> need

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
okay I now see what he's got um I need

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.100 
okay I now see what he's got um I need
to<00:04:58.880> wait<00:04:59.000> for<00:04:59.030> vortex<00:04:59.539> what<00:04:59.780> I'm<00:04:59.840> going<00:04:59.960> to<00:04:59.990> do

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
to wait for vortex what I'm going to do

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.219 
to wait for vortex what I'm going to do
is<00:05:00.259> vortex<00:05:01.060> run<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.810> know<00:05:02.900> he's<00:05:03.080> gone

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
is vortex run in so I know he's gone

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.309 
is vortex run in so I know he's gone
expansion<00:05:04.720> basically<00:05:05.720> just<00:05:05.840> run<00:05:06.050> in<00:05:06.199> after

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
expansion basically just run in after

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.820 
expansion basically just run in after
the<00:05:06.530> vortex<00:05:07.389> get<00:05:08.389> everything<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.440> just<00:05:09.650> get

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
the vortex get everything like just get

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.689 
the vortex get everything like just get
right<00:05:10.009> in<00:05:10.130> there<00:05:14.349> so<00:05:15.349> here<00:05:15.740> we<00:05:15.770> go<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:16.580> got

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
right in there so here we go you got

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.860 
right in there so here we go you got
getting<00:05:16.909> stalkers<00:05:17.270> in<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.449> back

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.990 

like<00:05:24.470> look<00:05:25.070> what<00:05:25.250> he's<00:05:25.400> doing<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.730> unit

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
like look what he's doing to this unit

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.620 
like look what he's doing to this unit
she's<00:05:26.120> not<00:05:26.270> really<00:05:27.670> not<00:05:28.670> really<00:05:28.760> using<00:05:29.180> them<00:05:29.450> I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
she's not really not really using them I

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.450 
she's not really not really using them I
mean<00:05:29.900> right<00:05:30.650> they<00:05:30.830> there's<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.100> money<00:05:31.220> more

tax boom all right now I need to get my

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.070 
tax boom all right now I need to get my
zealots<00:05:34.070> in<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.340> vortex<00:05:34.750> get<00:05:35.750> those<00:05:35.870> zealots

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
zealots in the vortex get those zealots

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.740 
zealots in the vortex get those zealots
in<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.500> vortex<00:05:36.700> get<00:05:37.700> afford<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.300> get<00:05:38.480> in<00:05:38.600> the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
in the vortex get afford to get in the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.800 
in the vortex get afford to get in the
vortex<00:05:39.970> you<00:05:40.970> know<00:05:41.060> these<00:05:41.180> force<00:05:41.450> fields<00:05:41.720> are

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
vortex you know these force fields are

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:55.440 
vortex you know these force fields are
really<00:05:42.140> hurting<00:05:42.740> me<00:05:42.890> though<00:05:53.800> put<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:54.920> a<00:05:55.010> fire

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
really hurting me though put in a fire

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.280 
really hurting me though put in a fire
