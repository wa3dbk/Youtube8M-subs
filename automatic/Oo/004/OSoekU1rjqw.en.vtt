00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.129
 If you like good pastry 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.440
 stay for you to see the video already 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:22.470
 I say like me 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.550
 tree I recycle my bases for 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.160
 cakes a base for a paper of 80 to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.160
 100 people will depend a lot on the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.250
 of your paper so that you put it between 80 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.410
 and 90 people the basis for a cake of 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.089
 60 people I leave you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 this is a base for a cake of 40 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:55.680
 people stay with the measures is is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.000
 a base for a cake of 20 people 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.309
 I leave you the measures we will need 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 Well, what I do is put them in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.930
 a bag of garbage 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.100
 if I do not fit in one item two bags 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.140
 I keep them there free of dust 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.070
 and I use them 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:27.619
 I make them when they are very small 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.619
 they are bigger then 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.210
 here we keep them free of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.369
 and powder bacteria 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.570
 and we can have them already ready is there 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.799
 so as not to walk the mere day 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:51.700
 then it is a way to recycle and 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.100
 have here then look further back 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.130
 it's going to be ready by the time 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.079
 we need it since we are not going 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.869
 which we have the same list can do 10 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.420
 of these 10 of each and have them in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.680
 some bags separately and this is because 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.480
 an excellent idea for us that we 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
 like the pastry or for those who do not 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.849

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.860
 recycle and well then if you liked the
