be safe again for about the same
distance<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.630> again<00:01:22.049> about

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
distance that we are here again about

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
distance that we are here again about
three<00:01:22.470> colleagues<00:01:22.770> okay<00:01:23.280> any<00:01:23.460> idea<00:01:23.759> why<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
three colleagues okay any idea why that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
three colleagues okay any idea why that
would<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:25.070> um<00:01:27.409> well<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.040> anything<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.400> do

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
would be um well is it anything to do

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.010 
would be um well is it anything to do
the<00:01:29.640> fact<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.909> you've<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.960> over

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the fact that you've got to get over

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
the fact that you've got to get over
here<00:01:31.500> haven't<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
here haven't you because you're going to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
here haven't you because you're going to
be<00:01:32.340> turning<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.479> turning<00:01:33.930> right

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
be turning right what if I turning right

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.480 
be turning right what if I turning right
that's<00:01:34.409> quite<00:01:34.560> correct<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> get

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that's quite correct so you need to get

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700 
that's quite correct so you need to get
presumably<00:01:35.880> anyone<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.470> why<00:01:37.590> we

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
presumably anyone okay so that's why we

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
presumably anyone okay so that's why we
go<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> Fife<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.520> were<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> we'd

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
go about that Fife we were here we'd

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
go about that Fife we were here we'd
have<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> sort<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> angle<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.530> yes

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
have to be that sort of angle there yes

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
have to be that sort of angle there yes
ok<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> reverse<00:01:42.420> maneuver<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.990> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
ok now it's a reverse maneuver so like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.450 
ok now it's a reverse maneuver so like
on<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.470> threat<00:01:43.649> reversing<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.310> asked

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
on your threat reversing we asked

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
on your threat reversing we asked
ourselves<00:01:44.549> four<00:01:45.090> questions<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.689> before

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
ourselves four questions first before

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
ourselves four questions first before
any<00:01:46.560> reversing<00:01:47.009> remember<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.369> those<00:01:47.460> four

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
any reversing remember what those four

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
any reversing remember what those four
four<00:01:48.000> questions<00:01:48.299> work<00:01:48.479> um<00:01:49.460> remember<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> safe

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
four questions work um remember the safe

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
four questions work um remember the safe

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it control exactly if you look at the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
it control exactly if you look at the
road<00:02:22.650> ahead<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.890> us<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.610> slight<00:02:23.879> up<00:02:24.060> slope

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
road ahead of us it's a slight up slope

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
road ahead of us it's a slight up slope
isn't<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.810> inter<00:02:25.170> slightly<00:02:25.739> what<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:25.980> fairly

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
isn't it inter slightly what is fairly

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.500 
isn't it inter slightly what is fairly
straight<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.610> washing<00:02:26.939> there<00:02:27.060> isn't<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.299> yeah

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
straight in washing there isn't it yeah

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
straight in washing there isn't it yeah
so<00:02:27.900> we're<00:02:28.049> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.230> need<00:02:28.319> touch<00:02:28.709> control<00:02:29.040> up

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so we're going to need touch control up

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860 
so we're going to need touch control up
the<00:02:29.340> hill<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.609> course<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.030> then<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> little

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the hill of course and then a little

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.599 
the hill of course and then a little
less<00:02:30.959> trash<00:02:31.140> internal<00:02:31.560> mail<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.370> taken
