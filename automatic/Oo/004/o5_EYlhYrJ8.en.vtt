verse anyway this one is a little bit
about<00:00:20.829> strumming<00:00:21.070> patterns<00:00:21.460> you<00:00:21.759> know<00:00:21.880> how

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
about strumming patterns you know how

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.089 
about strumming patterns you know how
much<00:00:22.180> I<00:00:22.300> love<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.869> explain<00:00:23.740> strumming

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
much I love to explain strumming

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.980 
much I love to explain strumming
patterns<00:00:24.400> but<00:00:24.550> it<00:00:24.820> is<00:00:24.939> kind<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.210> crucial<00:00:25.539> for

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
patterns but it is kind of crucial for

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:35.590 
patterns but it is kind of crucial for
this<00:00:26.050> one<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.480> there's<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.869> chords

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.750 

this<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.320> way<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.440> strum<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:36.980> term<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.550> think

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
this is the way I strum it term I think

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.180 
this is the way I strum it term I think
it's<00:00:37.880> right

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.639 

just<00:00:43.789> do<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:43.969> slowly<00:00:44.300> I'm<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:44.629> gonna<00:00:44.750> ups<00:00:45.410> and

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
just do it slowly I'm not gonna ups and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:59.880 
just do it slowly I'm not gonna ups and
down<00:00:45.769> so<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.039> can<00:00:46.190> work<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:46.430> yourself<00:00:46.879> so

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.549 

I<00:00:59.950> up<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.970> down<00:01:01.000> differently<00:01:01.809> like<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.380> don't

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
I up and I down differently like I don't

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.070 
I up and I down differently like I don't
know<00:01:02.710> people<00:01:03.520> who<00:01:03.640> sort<00:01:03.880> of<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.870> a<00:01:04.900> real

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
bug bear in mind these strumming

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.380 
bug bear in mind these strumming
patterns<00:01:06.460> people<00:01:06.729> keep<00:01:06.880> saying<00:01:07.030> what's<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
patterns people keep saying what's the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.230 
patterns people keep saying what's the
strumming<00:01:07.720> pattern<00:01:08.430> whatever<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.550> want<00:01:09.760> you

know<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.570> do<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.840> differently<00:01:10.960> every<00:01:11.320> time<00:01:11.500> so

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.109 

that<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.860> too<00:01:18.070> much<00:01:18.310> whether<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.670> up<00:01:18.820> all<00:01:18.970> your

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
that is too much whether you up all your

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.539 
that is too much whether you up all your
danzo's<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.750> get<00:01:19.900> that<00:01:20.340> roughly<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> right

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
danzo's you get that roughly the right

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.880 
danzo's you get that roughly the right
sound

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890
