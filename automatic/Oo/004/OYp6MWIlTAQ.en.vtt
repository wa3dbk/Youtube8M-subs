00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 his sporting friends fond of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.880
 soccer welcome to 4 technicians who are 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.440
 of beauty bales and beppe d'ercole it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.330
 last year thanks to the new impact 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 engine since the introduction of the pact ical 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 defending we thought it was achieved 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 the summit of the development process of 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 fifa 13 in part so since they find 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 unchanged the controls and with them also the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 new defensive system in the same way 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.029
 also the physical engine the same as the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.859
 last year only this time reading 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 of contacts between players is much more 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.149
 specifies the biggest change of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.200
 however, fifa 13 is represented by the first 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.210
 touch control 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.190
 in other words the attempt by 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.120
 and to simulate the ability of the various samples 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 to stop the ball 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.570
 the addition of this feature contributes to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 make the simulation even more 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
 realistic especially with bad 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 weather conditions 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 this does not mean that a brocco 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.210
 systematically he will stop a stop but 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 simply that there are more 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 possibility that a messenger from me a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
 balloon compared to an antonini that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.109
 introduces a random variable in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.489
 game that drives the player to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.379
 choose the type of action to be performed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 based on their training 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.640
 this however also applies the opposite in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 other words a player by technique 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 superfine will be able to stop the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 flask a handkerchief and use this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.250
 capacity 3 pc make the chiral defender 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.659
 this superior ability to control 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.280
 the ball can be used for 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.350
 develop action that centrally 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 since the attackers will be less 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.340
 prone to getting ahead of the defenders 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.580
 without considering that it has been improved 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 further dribbling control 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.130
 take these items absolutely 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 realistic it is necessary that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 de gaulle developers in a way 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.770
 perfect footballer statistics 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 thanks to the football club the technicians and to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.400
 they will try to maintain constantly 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200
 updated the values ​​of a sample 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.740
 going to change their strength 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
 according to their latest performances 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.530
 the other change that is possible 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
 to note is the renewed capacity of the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 soccer player fit into the spaces for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.509
 propose itself in the attack phase 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.130
 the flip side is a 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.570
 behavior a little too aggressive from 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.680
 part of the defenders that sometimes 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.259
 they will leave bars that hardly 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 all these new features can be filled 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.770
 to the even more effective offensive phase 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.659
 you will have to check it directly 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
 your defense and try not to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.320
 mistake the timing of the intervention 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 to bring the result home 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 a whole series will come to your aid 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.700
 of new animations that will allow i 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.530
 soccer players 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.150
 automatically launched some balloons 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.250
 in the midst of all this splendor 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.599
 problems like i 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 goalkeepers who reject the ball 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.390
 too often in the middle of the small area 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 and defenders that on this occasion 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 they sleep in the general economy though 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.750
 these episodes are less frequent than 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.340
 in the past the fundamentalists of the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 manual checks will change as 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
 latter way of controlling the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.160
 departure for slightly simplified in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
 many will turn up their noses but that makes it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.730
 more easily approached this type 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.730
 of controls also of the players mn 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 hardcore football lovers will notice 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.610
 that many of these new goodies 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.140
 make the games more and more 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.730
 realistic both to play and from 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.380
 watching this will require one 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 absolute mastery of controls 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 artificial intelligence indeed will be 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.319
 always sovereign given by having but 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.700
 decidedly more honest than in the past 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.709
 if the balance found by ea 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.660
 should it not satisfy branches it will be 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.049
 always possible to calibrate the sliders as 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.910
 it best suits you if you play against the 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.620
 computer should not be good anymore 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.569
 you could throw me into the mode 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.140
 seasons even more complete than the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.880
 past 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.530
 the coach who lives in each of 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.269
 you gila knowing that you will no longer have to 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.310
 rework the formations before each 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.739
 game as supporter will remember i 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.269
 changes of form and of men beyond 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.920
 to an aesthetic reorganization e 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.690
 functional the heart of the mode 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.639
 should be virtually unchanged 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.410
 with intelligent organization of 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.970
 matches in the league itself press dai 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.400
 which draws an opponent of yours 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.019
 level 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.790
 the success of the season mode in 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.290
 such as to push to apply one 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.600
 similar structure also for the teams the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.370
 virtual pro will have five available 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 championships to bring your team to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.010
 dominate the net the 11 against 11 challenges 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.870
 the bouquet of methods put in place 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.730
 by sure it doesn't end here offline 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 you can organize a tournament or one 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.239
 coach or player career 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.130
 the structure of this mode is 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.630
 remained virtually unchanged if not 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.340
 that between one game and another have been 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.290
 inserted events capable of 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.459
 make more career narrative for 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.989
 regarding the virtual pro 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.730
 will debut at skill challenges 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.650
 in other words a whole series of tests 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.480
 that will help on one side to take 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.190
 confidence with the controls and on the other a 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.859
 earn valuable points to yours 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.480
 alter ego these exercises will occupy the 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.769
 place of alignment in the arena e 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.720
 will give a purpose to this intervention 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.069
 otherwise I will be present sin 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.050
 from the beginning also where it was 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.370
 introduced the able seasons mode 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.169
 to select more carefully the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.180
 online opponents those they bring 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.770
 a previous team will get gods 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.550
 free packages to start the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.229
 new vintage as an extra gear from the 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.879
 technical point of view we can not that 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.770
 cite the always fluid animations and 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.490
 credible even in the most difficult situations 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.500
 unthinkable 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.539
 in terms of faces, work is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.949
 has been done with care the only flaw is 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.680
 that products athletes perfectly 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.300
 are a number rather reduced 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.710
 aspect under which he fails to 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.180
 to rival the competitor of 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.830
 phonic is precisely the capacity of 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.259
 capture through shots and 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.789
 replay the football seen on television 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.919
 nothing to say under the audio profile 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.900
 to the commentary caressa bergomi was 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.520
 added a bordocampo entry répit 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.500
 rose the soundtrack as well as i 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.240
 Stag sampling always punctual a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.240
 emphasize every stage of the game 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.669
 also thanks to support for move e 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.110
 kinect also the owners of these 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:27.059
 peripherals do some option 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:28.289
 studied for their way is still successful 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.659
 once to improve what 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.150
 it seemed a practically perfect title 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.069
 fifa 13 thanks to a few simple ones 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.270
 changes amazes if it is in the field 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.339
 off the pitch 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.990
 some flaws still remain but if 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:42.059
 you feel like time to learn to 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.469
 playing makes us 13 is one of the titles 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:45.469
 more complete sports
