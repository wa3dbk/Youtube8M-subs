because<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.030> Apple<00:03:52.329> watch<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.930> still<00:03:53.350> not

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
because the Apple watch has still not

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.610 
because the Apple watch has still not
come<00:03:53.680> out<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.150> I've<00:03:55.150> never<00:03:55.690> really<00:03:56.109> touched<00:03:56.410> a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
come out and I've never really touched a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.520 
come out and I've never really touched a
moto<00:03:56.829> 360<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.359> definitely<00:03:58.959> do<00:03:59.230> plan<00:03:59.500> on

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
moto 360 but I definitely do plan on

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.259 
moto 360 but I definitely do plan on
buying<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> Apple<00:04:00.579> watch<00:04:00.700> just<00:04:01.090> for

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
buying in the Apple watch just for

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.390 
buying in the Apple watch just for
review<00:04:01.660> I'm<00:04:02.140> not<00:04:02.350> entirely<00:04:02.709> sure<00:04:02.890> if<00:04:03.040> i'll

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
review I'm not entirely sure if i'll

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.550 
review I'm not entirely sure if i'll
keep<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.750> know<00:04:04.870> we'll<00:04:05.140> see<00:04:05.170> how<00:04:05.530> it

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
keep it just you know we'll see how it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.849 
keep it just you know we'll see how it
ends<00:04:06.310> up<00:04:06.430> being<00:04:06.459> but<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.750> will<00:04:08.350> definitely<00:04:08.500> talk

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
ends up being but I will definitely talk

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.069 
ends up being but I will definitely talk
about<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.370> once<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.060> get<00:04:10.269> my<00:04:10.390> hands<00:04:10.600> on<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
about that once I get my hands on it and

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.400 
about that once I get my hands on it and
now<00:04:11.560> let's<00:04:11.739> move<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.280> apps<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.230> Moto

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
now let's move on to apps so the Moto

sort is massive and I'm sure they're

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.370 
sort is massive and I'm sure they're
going<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.310> killing<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.210> apps<00:04:33.020> game

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
going to be killing it in the apps game

going to be killing it in the apps game
we've<00:04:33.830> already<00:04:34.010> seen<00:04:34.220> some<00:04:34.400> previews<00:04:34.730> at<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
we've already seen some previews at the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.720 
we've already seen some previews at the
keynote<00:04:35.360> as<00:04:35.780> well<00:04:36.230> as<00:04:36.440> their<00:04:36.860> website<00:04:37.280> which<00:04:37.580> I

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
keynote as well as their website which I

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.210 
keynote as well as their website which I
think<00:04:38.000> looks<00:04:38.210> fantastic<00:04:38.900> some<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.040> apps

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
think looks fantastic some of the apps

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.730 
think looks fantastic some of the apps
do<00:04:40.640> seem<00:04:41.060> underwhelming<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.200> feel<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.530> they

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
do seem underwhelming I feel like they

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.590 
do seem underwhelming I feel like they
can<00:04:42.890> flesh<00:04:43.130> out<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.730> features<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:44.120> little<00:04:44.390> bit

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
can flesh out the features a little bit

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.630 
can flesh out the features a little bit
more<00:04:44.780> like<00:04:45.260> transit<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.980> don't<00:04:46.250> know<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.610> just

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
more like transit I don't know it just

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.250 
more like transit I don't know it just
doesn't<00:04:47.150> look<00:04:47.270> like<00:04:47.510> a<00:04:48.160> good<00:04:49.160> transit<00:04:50.060> app<00:04:50.330> I

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
doesn't look like a good transit app I

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.350 
doesn't look like a good transit app I
feel<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:51.890> Google<00:04:52.490> Maps<00:04:52.700> would<00:04:52.910> be<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.060> better

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
feel like Google Maps would be a better

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.570 
feel like Google Maps would be a better
companion<00:04:53.720> for<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.200> kind<00:04:54.410> of

companion for that kind of
transportation<00:04:55.630> application<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:57.350> that's

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
transportation application but that's

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.400 
transportation application but that's
all<00:04:58.400> preference<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.090> I'm<00:04:59.540> sure<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.750> all

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
all preference and I'm sure that all

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.530 
all preference and I'm sure that all
these<00:05:00.950> developers<00:05:01.610> are<00:05:01.820> making<00:05:02.150> some<00:05:02.330> great

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
these developers are making some great

battery<00:05:07.760> life<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.240> definitely<00:05:08.660> one<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.290> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
battery life is definitely one of the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.820 
battery life is definitely one of the
key<00:05:09.620> factors<00:05:09.830> for<00:05:10.730> technology<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.630> general

both<00:05:41.000> companies<00:05:41.270> centering<00:05:42.020> that<00:05:42.200> smart

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
both companies centering that smart

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.370 
both companies centering that smart
watches<00:05:43.040> are<00:05:43.580> completely<00:05:44.419> new<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.720> us<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:45.110> think

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
watches are completely new to us I think

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.050 
watches are completely new to us I think
battery<00:05:45.680> life<00:05:45.890> will<00:05:46.100> definitely<00:05:46.490> improve<00:05:46.790> as

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
battery life will definitely improve as

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.630 
battery life will definitely improve as
time<00:05:47.479> goes<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.229> as<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.950> next<00:05:49.190> generation

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
time goes on as the next generation

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.330 
time goes on as the next generation
comes<00:05:49.850> out<00:05:50.030> but<00:05:50.720> for<00:05:51.200> now<00:05:51.350> I<00:05:51.380> think<00:05:51.770> this<00:05:51.890> is<00:05:51.950> a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
comes out but for now I think this is a

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.190 
comes out but for now I think this is a
great<00:05:52.550> start<00:05:52.700> it's<00:05:53.360> literally<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.930> same

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
great start it's literally the same

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.710 
great start it's literally the same
thing<00:05:54.470> as<00:05:54.650> having<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:55.280> smartphone<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.390> charge

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
thing as having a smartphone you charge

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.659 
thing as having a smartphone you charge
it<00:05:56.870> every<00:05:57.050> night<00:05:57.410> no<00:05:58.310> one's<00:05:58.490> really

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.480 
it every night no one's really
complaining<00:05:59.120> about<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.479> and<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.919> going<00:06:01.400> to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
complaining about it and it's going to

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.340 
complaining about it and it's going to
be<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.729> same<00:06:01.940> with<00:06:02.180> smartwatches<00:06:02.930> it's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
be the same with smartwatches it's

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.810 
be the same with smartwatches it's
