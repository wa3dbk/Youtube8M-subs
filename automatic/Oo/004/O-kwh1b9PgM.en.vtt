00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
this building here and I drew him out I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.699 
this building here and I drew him out I
don't<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.580> he<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:12.050> hacker<00:02:13.050> pro<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
don't know if he had a hacker pro and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.620 
don't know if he had a hacker pro and
actually<00:02:14.220> he<00:02:14.400> has<00:02:14.520> second<00:02:14.940> chances<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.450> can

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
actually he has second chances we can

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.190 
actually he has second chances we can
see<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.770> big<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:18.170> when<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
see and a big thing that I do is when I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.810 
see and a big thing that I do is when I
cease<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.830> whenever<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.160> knocks<00:02:20.489> him<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
cease it whenever I knocks him on the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.490 
cease it whenever I knocks him on the
second<00:02:21.209> chance<00:02:21.390> i<00:02:21.540> usually<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:21.989> leave<00:02:22.320> him

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
second chance i usually just leave him

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.310 
second chance i usually just leave him
there<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.910> proves<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:25.110> bad

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
there and it proves to be a really bad

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.530 
there and it proves to be a really bad
idea<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.489> fact<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.060> he<00:02:27.330> definitely

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
idea in this fact because he definitely

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.260 
idea in this fact because he definitely
got<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.100> helped<00:02:29.100> out<00:02:29.250> by<00:02:29.280> his<00:02:29.520> friend<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.060> all

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
got a helped out by his friend of all

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.940 
got a helped out by his friend of all
the<00:02:30.420> times<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.959> someone<00:02:31.770> had<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> chance<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the times that someone had the chance to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.100 
the times that someone had the chance to
rez<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.220> whatever<00:02:35.520> their<00:02:36.000> friend<00:02:36.300> they<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
rez or whatever their friend they do it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.800 
rez or whatever their friend they do it
here<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.220> was<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.209> cannot<00:02:39.630> believe

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
here and I was like I cannot believe

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
here and I was like I cannot believe
that<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.470> happened<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.950> laughed

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
that that just happened and I laughed

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.150 
that that just happened and I laughed
myself<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.209> happen<00:02:42.239> because

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
myself when it did happen because

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.190 
myself when it did happen because
normally<00:02:44.160> everybody<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.239> leaves<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.720> person

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
normally everybody just leaves a person

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.509 
normally everybody just leaves a person
there<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.709> guess<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.130> Search<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.489> Destroy

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
there but I guess I'm Search and Destroy

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.850 
there but I guess I'm Search and Destroy
it's<00:02:48.120> basically<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.900> having<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.380> another

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
it's basically like having a another

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.979 
it's basically like having a another
life<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.640> take<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.269> guy<00:02:51.480> out<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:51.870> you

that there was going to be so much if

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.480 
planes in the air my gun so but I'm
thinking<00:04:54.900> about<00:04:55.140> incorporating<00:04:55.470> against<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
thinking about incorporating against a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.880 
thinking about incorporating against a
little<00:04:57.240> avatar<00:04:57.720> land<00:04:57.960> into<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.470> lot<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.740> my

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
little avatar land into a lot of my

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.130 
little avatar land into a lot of my
commentaries<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.580> think<00:04:59.820> it's<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.210> really<00:05:00.540> big

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
commentaries I think it's a really big

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.860 
commentaries I think it's a really big
original<00:05:01.680> idea<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:03.060> actually<00:05:03.270> got<00:05:03.660> my

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
original idea and I actually got my

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.890 
original idea and I actually got my
avatar<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.650> look<00:05:04.890> really<00:05:05.700> damn<00:05:06.090> near<00:05:06.390> close<00:05:06.570> to

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.950 
did a damn good job of getting it as
close<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.390> my<00:05:18.510> actual<00:05:18.870> self<00:05:19.440> as<00:05:19.680> possible<00:05:20.250> and

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
close to my actual self as possible and

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.480 
close to my actual self as possible and
eventually<00:05:21.960> I'll<00:05:22.200> do<00:05:22.440> like<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.650> setup<00:05:22.980> video<00:05:23.190> or

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
eventually I'll do like a setup video or

eventually I'll do like a setup video or
something<00:05:23.610> like<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.090> I'll<00:05:24.390> show<00:05:24.630> my

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
something like that and I'll show my

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.190 
something like that and I'll show my
actual<00:05:25.710> self<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.580> my<00:05:26.610> actual<00:05:27.060> setup<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.720> hope

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
actual self and my actual setup and hope

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.810 
actual self and my actual setup and hope

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
maybe I can even get my setup as close
