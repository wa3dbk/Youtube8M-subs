that<00:01:57.540> sweet<00:01:57.780> spot<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> comes<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.159> physics

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that sweet spot when it comes to physics

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.389 
that sweet spot when it comes to physics
and<00:01:59.700> handling<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> still<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.710> 1111

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and handling I still think that the 1111

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
and handling I still think that the 1111
glitch<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.850> still<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.719> game<00:02:03.869> somewhere<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
glitch is still in the game somewhere I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
glitch is still in the game somewhere I
think<00:02:04.649> what<00:02:04.950> happened<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.570> they<00:02:06.570> haven't

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
think what happened was they haven't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.449 
think what happened was they haven't
been<00:02:07.110> changing<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> physics<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.310> have

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
been changing the physics what they have

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
been changing the physics what they have
been<00:02:08.580> doing<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.330> making<00:02:09.569> tweaks<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
been doing is like making tweaks just to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.350 
been doing is like making tweaks just to
make<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.709> better<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.730> until<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.720> new

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
make it better just until the new

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.530 
make it better just until the new
consoles<00:02:14.050> would<00:02:14.620> come<00:02:15.040> out<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> honestly

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
consoles would come out now I honestly

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.380 
consoles would come out now I honestly
don't<00:02:16.720> think<00:02:16.840> formula<00:02:17.560> 1<00:02:17.680> 2013<00:02:18.310> will<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.150> on

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
don't think formula 1 2013 will be on

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.720 
don't think formula 1 2013 will be on
the<00:02:19.420> next<00:02:19.690> gen<00:02:19.930> consoles<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.280> I'm<00:02:21.550> gonna

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the next gen consoles if it is I'm gonna

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.570 
the next gen consoles if it is I'm gonna
be<00:02:21.880> very<00:02:22.120> shocked<00:02:22.510> because<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.860> don't<00:02:24.370> think

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
be very shocked because I don't think

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.750 
be very shocked because I don't think
the<00:02:24.790> game<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.270> at<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> high<00:02:26.230> standard<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.070> be<00:02:27.580> on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the game is at a high standard to be on

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.640 
the game is at a high standard to be on
the<00:02:27.850> new<00:02:27.970> console<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.510> say<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.930> because

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
the new console and I say that because

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.610 
the new console and I say that because
all<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.700> doing<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.360> game<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.900> perfecting

obviously add better graphics at the

obviously add better graphics at the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
better physics system now on the topic

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.530 
better physics system now on the topic
of<00:03:01.780> physics<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.470> do<00:03:02.860> know<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.360> Steve<00:03:04.360> her

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
of physics I do know that Steve her

of physics I do know that Steve her
tweets<00:03:04.870> without<00:03:05.140> saying<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.459> physics

is<00:03:06.970> going<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.270> similar<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:08.280> 2011<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> think

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
is going to be similar to 2011 I think

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.430 
is going to be similar to 2011 I think
it's<00:03:09.940> going<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.150> be<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.390> mix<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.930> two<00:03:11.140> thousand

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
it's going to be a mix of two thousand

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.110 
it's going to be a mix of two thousand
eleven<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.800> two<00:03:11.980> thousand<00:03:12.370> twelve<00:03:12.520> together

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
eleven and two thousand twelve together

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.280 
eleven and two thousand twelve together
too<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> make<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.760> right<00:03:15.940> balance

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
too just to make that right balance

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.140 
too just to make that right balance
because<00:03:17.290> some<00:03:17.500> people<00:03:17.799> prefer<00:03:17.950> 2011<00:03:18.850> some

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
because some people prefer 2011 some

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.990 
because some people prefer 2011 some
people<00:03:19.390> prefer<00:03:19.530> 2012<00:03:20.530> what<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.250> advise<00:03:21.670> them<00:03:21.970> to

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
people prefer 2012 what I advise them to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.850 
people prefer 2012 what I advise them to
do<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:22.390> you're<00:03:22.540> watching<00:03:22.660> Steve<00:03:23.049> hood<00:03:23.230> you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
do and if you're watching Steve hood you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.699 
do and if you're watching Steve hood you
have<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.220> make<00:03:24.400> sure<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:25.540> test<00:03:25.959> out<00:03:26.200> every

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
have to make sure you test out every

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.070 
have to make sure you test out every
single<00:03:26.950> wheel<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:28.000> there<00:03:28.360> because

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
single wheel that you have there because

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.420 
single wheel that you have there because
that's<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:29.799> crucial<00:03:30.040> especially

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that's going to be so crucial especially

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.080 
that's going to be so crucial especially
on<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> ps3<00:03:31.360> because<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.160> many<00:03:33.370> people<00:03:33.850> had

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
on the ps3 because so many people had

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.910 
on the ps3 because so many people had
problems<00:03:34.360> with<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.930> steering<00:03:35.260> wheels<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.830> was

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
problems with the steering wheels it was

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.830 
problems with the steering wheels it was
unbelievable<00:03:36.730> nobody<00:03:37.180> could<00:03:37.330> find<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.690> right

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
recommended settings were so why advise

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.300 
recommended settings were so why advise
you<00:03:43.540> guys<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.260> make<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.620> recommended

wheel<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.269> know<00:03:49.390> when<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.690> start<00:03:49.930> up

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
wheel so that you know when you start up

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.960 
wheel so that you know when you start up
the<00:03:50.200> game<00:03:50.380> it's<00:03:50.890> kind<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.220> annoying<00:03:51.489> when<00:03:51.850> you

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
the game it's kind of annoying when you

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030 
the game it's kind of annoying when you
can't<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.110> right<00:03:53.350> balance<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.860> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
can't get that right balance of the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.590 
can't get that right balance of the
wheel<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.430> you're<00:03:54.910> having<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.209> figure<00:03:55.390> out

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
wheel and you're having to figure out

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.120 
wheel and you're having to figure out
for<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> whole<00:03:56.170> week<00:03:56.500> trying<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.830> figure

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
for like a whole week trying to figure

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.520 
for like a whole week trying to figure
out<00:03:57.160> what<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> right<00:03:57.880> we<00:03:58.450> all<00:03:58.480> set<00:03:58.780> up<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.260> what

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
out what the right we all set up is what

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.920 
out what the right we all set up is what
the<00:03:59.739> right<00:03:59.890> settings<00:04:00.370> are<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.720> always

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
the right settings are and it always

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.229 
the right settings are and it always
depends<00:04:02.380> on<00:04:02.650> people<00:04:02.980> driving<00:04:03.670> styles<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.150> to

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
depends on people driving styles as to

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.180 
depends on people driving styles as to
any<00:04:04.390> problem<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.410> what<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.650> guys<00:04:05.769> need<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.100> do

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
any problem so what you guys need to do

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.280 
any problem so what you guys need to do
is<00:04:06.489> figure<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:06.880> people's<00:04:07.450> driving<00:04:07.720> styles<00:04:08.200> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
is figure out people's driving styles so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.340 
is figure out people's driving styles so
like<00:04:08.440> have<00:04:08.620> like<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:09.030> kid<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.570> gets<00:04:10.780> many

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
like have like a kid just just gets many

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.289 
like have like a kid just just gets many
people<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.860> your<00:04:12.130> office<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.730> test<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
people in your office to test out the

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.880 
people in your office to test out the
game<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> wheel<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.049> then<00:04:14.470> what<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.739> can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
game on the wheel and then what you can

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.560 
game on the wheel and then what you can
do<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.250> figure<00:04:15.519> out<00:04:15.640> what<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.090> aggressive

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
do is figure out what the aggressive

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.050 
do is figure out what the aggressive
role<00:04:16.780> settings<00:04:17.260> are<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:18.100> normal<00:04:18.489> settings

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
role settings are the normal settings

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.290 
role settings are the normal settings
and<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.829> smooth<00:04:21.310> settings<00:04:21.789> for<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.060> smooth

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and the smooth settings for the smooth

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.320 
and the smooth settings for the smooth
drivers<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:24.280> should<00:04:24.460> do<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.910> every

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
drivers so you should do that on every

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.760 
drivers so you should do that on every
single<00:04:25.570> wheel<00:04:25.990> because

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
single wheel because

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.369 
single wheel because
it<00:04:26.919> saves<00:04:27.250> everyone<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:28.060> lot<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.449> time<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.050> a

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
it saves everyone a lot of time and a

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.559 
it saves everyone a lot of time and a
lot<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.590> hassle<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.370> try<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.060> figure<00:04:31.240> out<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
lot of hassle to try and figure out the

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.270 
lot of hassle to try and figure out the
settings<00:04:31.930> because<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.379> real<00:04:32.620> put<00:04:32.919> off<00:04:33.129> I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
settings because it's a real put off I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.460 
settings because it's a real put off I
mean<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.669> remember<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.360> first<00:04:34.599> whole<00:04:34.930> month<00:04:35.229> I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
mean I remember the first whole month I

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.249 
mean I remember the first whole month I
was<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.889> so<00:04:36.220> depressed<00:04:36.729> because<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.300> couldn't

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
was just so depressed because I couldn't

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.379 
was just so depressed because I couldn't
get<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.680> game<00:04:38.919> working<00:04:39.430> perfectly<00:04:39.940> with<00:04:40.270> the

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
get the game working perfectly with the

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.119 
get the game working perfectly with the
wheel<00:04:40.569> and<00:04:40.870> what<00:04:41.289> made<00:04:41.440> Tunes<00:04:41.710> worst<00:04:41.949> was<00:04:42.099> the

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
wheel and what made Tunes worst was the

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.920 
wheel and what made Tunes worst was the
kept<00:04:42.430> patching<00:04:42.879> the<00:04:42.970> game<00:04:43.150> kept<00:04:43.509> patching<00:04:43.840> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
kept patching the game kept patching the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.659 
kept patching the game kept patching the
game<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.409> the<00:04:44.919> rule<00:04:45.099> settings<00:04:45.550> were

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
game and the rule settings were

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.820 
game and the rule settings were
different<00:04:46.090> every<00:04:46.479> single<00:04:46.750> time<00:04:46.930> on<00:04:47.349> default

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
different every single time on default

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.409 
different every single time on default
so<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.370> could<00:04:48.550> never<00:04:48.759> get<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.210> perfect

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
so you could never get the perfect

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.050 
so you could never get the perfect
settings<00:04:50.080> now<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.009> know<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.520> was<00:04:51.699> more<00:04:51.849> of<00:04:51.909> a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
settings now I know this was more of a

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.270 
settings now I know this was more of a
problem<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.599> ps3<00:04:52.870> because<00:04:53.440> on<00:04:53.740> xbox<00:04:54.159> and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
problem on the ps3 because on xbox and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.629 
problem on the ps3 because on xbox and
pc<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.699> know<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.090> can<00:04:55.270> adjust<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.710> amount<00:04:57.340> of

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
pc I know you can adjust the amount of

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.290 
pc I know you can adjust the amount of
rotation<00:04:57.810> on<00:04:58.810> most<00:04:59.349> wheels<00:04:59.590> so<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.819> don't<00:05:01.210> know

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
rotation on most wheels so I don't know

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.779 
rotation on most wheels so I don't know
you<00:05:01.569> guys<00:05:01.750> figure<00:05:02.530> out<00:05:02.740> figure<00:05:02.949> that<00:05:03.190> out<00:05:03.220> you

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
guys are the ones who create the games

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.529 
guys are the ones who create the games
here<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.520> guys<00:05:06.669> should<00:05:06.699> know<00:05:07.060> what<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.389> do
