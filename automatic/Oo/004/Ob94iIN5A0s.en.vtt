00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.090
 It is already dark, but Sebastian has to finish a text by tomorrow 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.569
 He prefers to work on such a warm night 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:08.849
 opened window 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 there comes in fresh air 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.240
 but also uninvited guests 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.240
 they are attracted to the light 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.839
 outside the bright street lamp attracts many more insects 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.039
 always in a circle more and more they fly into the light even if they burn themselves 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.679
 again and again 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
 why does she so magically attract the light? 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.900
 in the great outdoors there is no artificial light at night as can 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.420
 flying insects at mosque and orient 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.840
 if the insect always maintains the same angle to the moon then it can 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 fly straight ahead 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.280
 Now it comes close to a lamp which is mostly bright than the moon and the moon 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.820
 Insect and always hot at the brightest point, it gets distracted 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.270
 But most insects do not fly to the light, they rather dance in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 Circles around the land do come closer to her 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 this also depends on the angle to the light source, it caused Winkl 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 however, that the insect is getting closer and closer to the lamp 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 fell into it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.670
 why can it fly straight ahead if it decided on Monday? 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.190
 That's because the moon is so far away 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.440
 This is like driving a car. Things that are farther away seem to be longer 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.870
 to drive here even though they are just as solid as the things that are 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.350
 we are more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.869
 and the sun went out the whole time the distance to the sun remains 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.869
 always the same 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.149
 it's the same with the moon at night 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.370
 he is so far away that a champagne that can not come anymore 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.370
 The spelled always stays the same as Petersen Sector 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.889
 a lamp is much more but the insect does not want that 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.889
 actually just fly straight ahead and always get close to the lamp 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.219
 until that's it 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.479
 and because that's the way the Baster prefers the window to come otherwise 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.700
 join in more later
