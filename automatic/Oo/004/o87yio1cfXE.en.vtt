video<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> want<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.259> discuss<00:00:13.620> ketone<00:00:14.099> bodies<00:00:14.519> so

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
video I want to discuss ketone bodies so

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.090 
video I want to discuss ketone bodies so
what<00:00:15.690> are<00:00:15.929> ketone<00:00:16.500> bodies

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
what are ketone bodies

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.200 
what are ketone bodies
well<00:00:17.640> once<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.779> oxidize<00:00:19.439> fatty<00:00:20.160> acids<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:21.000> get

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
well once we oxidize fatty acids we get

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.450 
well once we oxidize fatty acids we get
something<00:00:21.600> which<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> known<00:00:22.109> as<00:00:22.350> acetyl<00:00:22.920> co<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
something which is known as acetyl co a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.689 
something which is known as acetyl co a
now<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.869> liver<00:00:25.050> mitochondria<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> does

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
now the liver mitochondria what it does

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.480 
now the liver mitochondria what it does
is<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.180> convert<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.930> acetyl<00:00:28.230> co<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.949> into

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
is it can convert this acetyl co a into

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.299 
is it can convert this acetyl co a into
ketone<00:00:30.029> bodies<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.260> there's<00:00:31.500> three<00:00:31.830> types<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
ketone bodies now there's three types of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.580 
ketone bodies now there's three types of
ketone<00:00:32.730> bodies<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.320> set<00:00:34.559> o

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
ketone bodies we can have a set o

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.650 
ketone bodies we can have a set o
acetate<00:00:35.280> 3<00:00:35.940> hydroxy<00:00:36.600> butyrate<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.559> acetone<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
set of acetate and three hydroxy

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.650 
set of acetate and three hydroxy
butyrate<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:42.290> transported<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> blood

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
butyrate are transported into the blood

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
butyrate are transported into the blood
towards<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> peripheral<00:00:46.350> tissues<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.980> then

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
towards the peripheral tissues and then

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
towards the peripheral tissues and then
here<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.360> reconverted<00:00:48.899> back<00:00:49.379> into

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here they can be reconverted back into

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.369 
here they can be reconverted back into
acetyl<00:00:50.280> co<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> asset<00:00:51.809> alkyl<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
acetyl co a and then the asset alkyl a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.700 
acetyl co a and then the asset alkyl a
can<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.800> used<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> TCA<00:00:53.969> cycle<00:00:54.649> now<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can be used in the TCA cycle now the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.670 
can be used in the TCA cycle now the
reason<00:00:56.160> why<00:00:56.660> ketone<00:00:57.660> bodies<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.140> important

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
reason why ketone bodies are important

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
reason why ketone bodies are important
is<00:00:58.829> number<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.789> they<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.300> utilized<00:01:00.570> by

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
is number one they can be utilized by

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
is number one they can be utilized by
the<00:01:01.590> brain<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.280> meet<00:01:02.489> energy<00:01:02.730> requirements

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the brain to meet energy requirements

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.500 
the brain to meet energy requirements
during<00:01:03.960> periods<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> fasting<00:01:05.330> number<00:01:06.330> two

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
during periods of fasting number two

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.800 
during periods of fasting number two
they<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.380> soluble<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.070> aqueous<00:01:08.670> solution<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
they are soluble in aqueous solution so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
they are soluble in aqueous solution so
they<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.110> need<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.470> transported<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
they don't need to be transported in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.649 
they don't need to be transported in
lipoproteins<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.750> carried<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.470> albumin<00:01:14.659> like

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
lipoproteins or carried by albumin like

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.100 
lipoproteins or carried by albumin like
other<00:01:16.250> lipids<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:18.270> produced<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
other lipids and it's produced in the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
other lipids and it's produced in the
liver<00:01:19.290> where<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.490> high<00:01:20.790> levels<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
liver where there are high levels of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.170 
liver where there are high levels of
acetyl<00:01:21.960> co<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.770> exceed<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> oxidative

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
acetyl co a which exceed the oxidative

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
acetyl co a which exceed the oxidative
capacity<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:25.790> liver<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.470> finally<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.680> used

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
capacity of liver and finally it's used

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.359 
capacity of liver and finally it's used
in<00:01:29.310> proportion<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.380> concentration<00:01:32.130> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
in proportion to the concentration in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.649 
in proportion to the concentration in
blood<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.659> done<00:01:33.900> by<00:01:35.659> tissues

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
blood and this is done by tissues

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
blood and this is done by tissues
outside<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> liver<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.979> skeletal<00:01:38.700> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
outside of the liver like skeletal or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.620 
outside of the liver like skeletal or
cardiac<00:01:39.329> muscle<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.610> important<00:01:42.299> thing<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cardiac muscle so the important thing to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.590 
cardiac muscle so the important thing to
remember<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.439> during<00:01:44.430> cases<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> prolonged

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
remember is during cases of prolonged

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.429 
remember is during cases of prolonged
fasting<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:47.220> body<00:01:47.430> utilizes<00:01:48.210> fatty<00:01:48.780> acids<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
fasting the body utilizes fatty acids to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.130 
fasting the body utilizes fatty acids to
form<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> acetyl<00:01:50.460> co<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> acetyl<00:01:51.930> co

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
form this acetyl co a then the acetyl co

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
form this acetyl co a then the acetyl co
a<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.649> converted<00:01:53.189> into<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> ketone<00:01:53.939> bodies

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
a is converted into the ketone bodies

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
a is converted into the ketone bodies
which<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.869> transported<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.219> peripheral

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
which can be transported to peripheral

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.270 
which can be transported to peripheral
tissues<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.719> reconverted<00:01:58.649> back<00:01:58.920> into

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
tissues and there reconverted back into

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
tissues and there reconverted back into
acetyl<00:01:59.790> co<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.290> used<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
acetyl co a and then this can be used in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.899 
acetyl co a and then this can be used in
the<00:02:02.909> TCA<00:02:03.299> cycle<00:02:03.500> thus<00:02:04.500> Alcoa<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.490> used<00:02:05.670> in

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the TCA cycle thus Alcoa can be used in

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.660 
the TCA cycle thus Alcoa can be used in
the<00:02:06.060> TCA<00:02:06.450> cycle<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.680> further<00:02:08.429> energy

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the TCA cycle and then further energy

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.650 
the TCA cycle and then further energy
can<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.239> obtained<00:02:09.629> during<00:02:10.229> periods<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
can be obtained during periods of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
can be obtained during periods of
fasting<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> low

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
bodies are broken down thank you very

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.960 
bodies are broken down thank you very
much<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.630> watching
