00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
table spread this is basically you put

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.140 
table spread this is basically you put
pressure<00:03:33.449> on<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.349> card<00:03:34.709> right<00:03:35.069> here<00:03:35.519> this

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
pressure on this card right here this

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.520 
pressure on this card right here this
bottom<00:03:36.419> card<00:03:36.720> says<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.049> go<00:03:37.109> ahead<00:03:37.230> directly

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
behind that it's a green card so

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.129 
behind that it's a green card so
basically<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:41.040> started<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.549> little<00:03:41.790> bit

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
basically you like started a little bit

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.569 
basically you like started a little bit
put<00:03:43.139> pressure<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.859> then<00:03:44.190> pull<00:03:44.370> back

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
put pressure on it and then pull back

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.360 
put pressure on it and then pull back
okay<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.349> is<00:03:46.470> what<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.949> is<00:03:47.129> what<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
okay so this is what this is what it

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.890 
okay so this is what this is what it
should<00:03:47.519> look<00:03:47.549> like<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.970> you

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
should look like like that and it you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.589 
should look like like that and it you
didn't<00:03:52.139> expose<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.650> green<00:03:52.859> card<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:53.819> how<00:03:54.359> are

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
didn't expose the green card so how are

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.180 
didn't expose the green card so how are
you<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:54.989> go<00:03:55.500> through<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.859> deck<00:03:56.040> like

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
you can just go through the deck like

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.319 
you can just go through the deck like
this<00:03:56.220> naked<00:03:56.639> cyclone

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
this naked cyclone

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.000 
this naked cyclone
alright<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.699> somebody<00:03:59.699> selects<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> card<00:04:01.010> all

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
alright so somebody selects the card all

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.800 
alright so somebody selects the card all
right<00:04:02.069> let's<00:04:02.699> say<00:04:03.000> we<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.389> see<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:03.750> a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
right let's say we can see just a

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.449 
right let's say we can see just a
diamond<00:04:04.260> since<00:04:04.500> that's<00:04:04.680> what<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.829> selected<00:04:05.250> and

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
diamond since that's what I selected and

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.770 
diamond since that's what I selected and
you're<00:04:05.909> gonna<00:04:06.000> have<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.209> know<00:04:06.299> something<00:04:06.540> as

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
you're gonna have to know something as

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.770

spit<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:06.960> six<00:05:07.320> spades<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:08.100> right<00:05:08.850> here<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:10.260> was

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
spit on six spades is right here it was

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.710 
spit on six spades is right here it was
right<00:05:10.830> here<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.490> has<00:05:12.210> to<00:05:12.360> be<00:05:12.480> on<00:05:12.570> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.290 
right here so that has to be on the
bottom<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.260> usually<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.770> just<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.940> let's<00:05:15.120> say

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
bottom so usually you just so let's say

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.670 
bottom so usually you just so let's say
it<00:05:15.600> was<00:05:15.720> like<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.960> ribbon<00:05:16.169> spread<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.530> just

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
it was like the ribbon spread you just

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.150 
it was like the ribbon spread you just
like<00:05:16.770> pull<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.340> off<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.120> then<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.770> just<00:05:19.980> put

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
like pull that off and then you just put

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.090 
like pull that off and then you just put
this<00:05:20.580> packet<00:05:21.080> right<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.230> top<00:05:22.410> of<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.680> packet

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
this packet right on top of this packet

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.380 
this packet right on top of this packet
so<00:05:24.000> now<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.180> six<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.570> Spades<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.080> there<00:05:25.550> or<00:05:26.550> so

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
so now the six of Spades is there or so

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.870 
so now the six of Spades is there or so
that's<00:05:27.630> pretty<00:05:27.870> much<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.640> then<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:29.729> do<00:05:29.850> a

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
that's pretty much it then you do a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.430 
that's pretty much it then you do a
double<00:05:30.120> lift<00:05:30.979> just<00:05:31.979> like<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:33.080> show<00:05:34.080> that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
double lift just like that and show that

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.380 
double lift just like that and show that
their<00:05:34.680> card<00:05:35.010> is<00:05:35.250> market<00:05:35.729> miraculously

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
their card is market miraculously

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.600 
their card is market miraculously
changed<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.229> green<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.710> card<00:05:38.010> which

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
changed to a green that card which

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.850 
changed to a green that card which
really<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.330> only<00:05:39.479> two<00:05:39.750> cards<00:05:40.020> here<00:05:40.140> just<00:05:40.740> like

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
really the only two cards here just like

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.710

that

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.230 
that
so<00:05:42.919> which<00:05:43.919> actually<00:05:44.370> saw<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.700> double<00:05:45.090> left

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
so which actually saw the double left

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.940 
so which actually saw the double left
because<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.750> camera<00:05:46.080> has<00:05:46.260> because<00:05:46.860> the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
because the camera has because the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.460 
because the camera has because the
camera<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.310> pointing<00:05:47.490> down<00:05:47.910> so<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.960> can<00:05:49.380> you

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
camera is pointing down so you can you

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.650 
camera is pointing down so you can you
could<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.770> could<00:05:49.919> see<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.510> usually<00:05:51.510> the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
could you could see it usually the

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.230 
could you could see it usually the
audience<00:05:52.020> has<00:05:52.200> come<00:05:52.380> is<00:05:52.620> looking<00:05:52.940> forward<00:05:53.940> not

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
audience has come is looking forward not

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.530 
audience has come is looking forward not
down

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
down

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.380 
down
so<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.290> usually<00:05:55.950> don't<00:05:56.070> see<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.400> SS<00:05:56.700> but<00:05:56.910> the

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
so I usually don't see the SS but the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.170 
so I usually don't see the SS but the
camera<00:05:57.660> didn't<00:05:57.870> buy<00:05:57.990> doesn't<00:05:58.290> matter<00:05:59.180> so

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
camera didn't buy doesn't matter so

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.390 
camera didn't buy doesn't matter so
basically<00:06:00.479> like<00:06:00.750> 210<00:06:01.110> in<00:06:01.200> diamonds<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.710> then
