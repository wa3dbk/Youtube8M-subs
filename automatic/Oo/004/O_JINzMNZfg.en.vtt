kill<00:05:33.070> monsters<00:05:33.370> slightly<00:05:34.000> faster<00:05:34.360> than<00:05:34.540> with

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
kill monsters slightly faster than with

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.110

my current ghost hunter gear I would

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.490 
my current ghost hunter gear I would
still<00:05:37.360> use<00:05:37.390> my<00:05:37.660> ghost<00:05:37.930> hunt<00:05:38.110> take<00:05:38.229> your<00:05:38.350> own

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.630 
still use my ghost hunt take your own
ghosts<00:05:38.919> because<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:39.940> 9<00:05:40.180> percent<00:05:40.510> damage<00:05:40.690> to

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
ghosts because it's 9 percent damage to

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.850 
ghosts because it's 9 percent damage to
ghosts<00:05:42.640> is<00:05:42.910> pretty<00:05:43.540> much<00:05:43.660> unbeatable<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.290> will

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
ghosts is pretty much unbeatable I will

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.070 
ghosts is pretty much unbeatable I will
that<00:05:44.979> have<00:05:45.130> better<00:05:45.430> power<00:05:45.910> armor<00:05:46.390> until<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.840> can

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
that have better power armor until I can

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.860 
that have better power armor until I can
get<00:05:47.260> Gore's<00:05:47.919> armor<00:05:48.220> which<00:05:48.970> will<00:05:49.450> take<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.630> long

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
get Gore's armor which will take a long

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.960 
get Gore's armor which will take a long
time<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.290> get<00:05:50.440> so<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:50.919> is<00:05:51.070> worth<00:05:51.310> doing<00:05:51.340> at<00:05:51.820> the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
time to get so it is worth doing at the

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.469 
time to get so it is worth doing at the
time<00:05:52.150> I<00:05:52.770> forgot<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.890> mention<00:05:54.040> a<00:05:54.400> lot<00:05:54.550> of<00:05:54.610> the

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
time I forgot to mention a lot of the

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.500 
time I forgot to mention a lot of the
events<00:05:55.780> in<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.350> older<00:05:56.620> clips<00:05:56.890> such<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> DS<00:05:57.640> are

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
events in the older clips such a DS are

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.320 
events in the older clips such a DS are
not<00:05:58.780> ordered<00:05:59.200> 100%<00:05:59.890> correctly<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:00.669> many<00:06:01.180> of

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
not ordered 100% correctly so many of

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.780 
not ordered 100% correctly so many of
them<00:06:01.510> are<00:06:01.780> actually<00:06:02.710> take<00:06:03.130> place<00:06:03.400> around<00:06:03.580> the

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
them are actually take place around the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.250 
them are actually take place around the
same<00:06:03.970> time<00:06:04.180> even<00:06:04.570> though<00:06:04.690> they<00:06:04.840> might<00:06:04.990> be<00:06:05.050> in

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
same time even though they might be in

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.740 
same time even though they might be in
different<00:06:05.650> episodes<00:06:05.820> but<00:06:06.820> that<00:06:07.240> shouldn't<00:06:07.690> be

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
different episodes but that shouldn't be

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.750 
different episodes but that shouldn't be
a<00:06:07.780> problem<00:06:07.930> because<00:06:08.410> they<00:06:08.800> all<00:06:09.010> tie<00:06:09.340> into

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
a problem because they all tie into

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.570 
a problem because they all tie into
bigger<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:10.240> longer<00:06:10.360> goals<00:06:10.750> anyways<00:06:11.140> I<00:06:11.580> hope

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
bigger and longer goals anyways I hope

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.390 
bigger and longer goals anyways I hope
you<00:06:12.640> enjoyed<00:06:13.120> my<00:06:13.150> arm<00:06:13.600> in<00:06:13.750> progress<00:06:14.140> and<00:06:14.400> see
