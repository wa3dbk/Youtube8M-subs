roster quite a little bit now I did hear

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
roster quite a little bit now I did hear
you<00:01:25.079> say<00:01:25.289> the<00:01:25.469> medic<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:25.859> Starcraft<00:01:26.369> 2<00:01:26.520> but

you say the medic from Starcraft 2 but

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
you say the medic from Starcraft 2 but
it's<00:01:26.789> or<00:01:26.880> craft<00:01:27.090> dude<00:01:27.210> there's<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> medevac

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's or craft dude there's the medevac

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's or craft dude there's the medevac
which<00:01:28.499> is<00:01:28.649> still<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.859> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.219> different<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
which is still a little bit different so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
which is still a little bit different so
there<00:01:30.600> seems<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.799> to
