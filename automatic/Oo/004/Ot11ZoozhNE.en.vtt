here's<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.790> smoker<00:00:03.859> apparatus<00:00:09.650> kind<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.710> show

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
here's the smoker apparatus kind of show

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.150 
here's the smoker apparatus kind of show
you<00:00:11.010> what's<00:00:11.280> inside

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.220 

these<00:00:20.760> salmon<00:00:21.300> were<00:00:23.570> prepared<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:24.810> brining

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
these salmon were prepared by brining

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
these salmon were prepared by brining
for<00:00:26.779> about<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.080> hour<00:00:28.520> from<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.700> point<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
for about one hour from the point that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.390 
for about one hour from the point that
we're<00:00:30.240> frozen<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:33.350> brined<00:00:34.350> them<00:00:34.620> let<00:00:35.370> them

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
we're frozen and I brined them let them

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.689 
we're frozen and I brined them let them
drying<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> path<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.019> a<00:00:37.140> fan<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.800> then

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
drying the in the path of a fan and then

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.520 
drying the in the path of a fan and then
threw<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.989> we're<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> look

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
threw them on and we're going to look

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.490 
threw them on and we're going to look
deep<00:00:40.800> down<00:00:41.690> down<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> bottom<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
deep down down at the bottom of the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.390 
deep down down at the bottom of the
smoker<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.220> a<00:00:45.290> stream<00:00:46.290> of<00:00:46.320> smoke<00:00:46.920> coming<00:00:47.100> up

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
smoker is a stream of smoke coming up

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.700 
smoker is a stream of smoke coming up
and<00:00:47.580> i'm<00:00:47.730> using<00:00:48.090> cedar<00:00:48.480> today<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.410> salmon

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and i'm using cedar today for the salmon

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
and i'm using cedar today for the salmon
and<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.610> expect<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.390> smoking<00:00:52.170> for

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and i expect this to be smoking for

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.160 
and i expect this to be smoking for
about<00:00:54.920> approximately<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.969> day<00:00:57.360> we'll<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.020> how

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
about approximately a day we'll see how

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.819 
about approximately a day we'll see how
the<00:00:58.230> wood<00:00:58.469> holds<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.950> put<00:00:59.579> 100<00:01:00.090> grams<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
the wood holds up put 100 grams and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.779 
the wood holds up put 100 grams and
starting<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.920> noon<00:01:02.129> we'll<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.610> how<00:01:02.700> long<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
starting at noon we'll see how long that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:11.240 
starting at noon we'll see how long that
lasts<00:01:07.160> I'm<00:01:08.160> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> put<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> lid<00:01:08.789> back<00:01:10.250> look

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
lasts I'm going to put the lid back look

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
lasts I'm going to put the lid back look
at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> bottom<00:01:11.820> area<00:01:12.530> actually<00:01:15.110> take<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> good

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
at the bottom area actually take a good

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.779 
at the bottom area actually take a good
look<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> bottom<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:19.050> have<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.789> hot

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
look at the bottom you have the hot

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.499 
look at the bottom you have the hot
plate<00:01:21.890> sitting<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:22.979> top<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
plate sitting on top and on top of the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190 
plate sitting on top and on top of the
hot<00:01:24.630> plate<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> cast-iron<00:01:26.130> pan<00:01:26.959> then<00:01:27.959> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hot plate is a cast-iron pan then the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.790 
hot plate is a cast-iron pan then the
chimney<00:01:28.819> and<00:01:29.819> on<00:01:29.910> top<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.179> that<00:01:30.530> very<00:01:31.530> top<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
chimney and on top of that very top of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.520 
chimney and on top of that very top of
that<00:01:32.009> chimney<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.610> opening<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.209> slightly

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
that chimney the opening is slightly

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
that chimney the opening is slightly
restricted<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.770> quite<00:01:35.099> like<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.369> tomato

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
restricted not quite like that tomato

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
restricted not quite like that tomato
can<00:01:36.240> inverted<00:01:37.050> but<00:01:37.289> just<00:01:38.039> kind<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:39.590> ducting

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
can inverted but just kind of a ducting

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.449 
can inverted but just kind of a ducting
piece<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> ducting<00:01:42.050> couple<00:01:43.050> pieces<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
piece of ducting couple pieces of

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.059 
piece of ducting couple pieces of
ducting<00:01:44.459> material<00:01:45.229> formed<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> chimney

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
ducting material formed into a chimney

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.790 
ducting material formed into a chimney
so<00:01:47.610> most<00:01:47.819> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> heat<00:01:49.610> dissipates<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:51.800> this

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
so most of the heat dissipates from this

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.740 
so most of the heat dissipates from this
is<00:01:52.950> very<00:01:53.160> hot<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.700> most<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.569> heat

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
is very hot and most of the heat

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.499 
is very hot and most of the heat
dissipates<00:01:55.319> outside<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.220> most<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.209> smoke

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
dissipates outside and most of the smoke

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.430 
dissipates outside and most of the smoke
goes<00:01:58.550> up<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.940> chimney<00:02:00.319> and<00:02:01.319> into<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.160> bottom

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
goes up the chimney and into the bottom

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.850 
goes up the chimney and into the bottom
and<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:05.640> uh<00:02:05.910> that's<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.590> smoker

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and that's uh that's it that's a smoker

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.410 
and that's uh that's it that's a smoker
will<00:02:08.099> back<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.550> take<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:09.000> look<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
will back up take a good look at it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.680 
will back up take a good look at it
again<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> ambient<00:02:11.700> temperatures<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
again the ambient temperatures in the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.140 
again the ambient temperatures in the
70s<00:02:12.930> today<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:15.920> I'm<00:02:16.920> hoping<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.430> inside

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
70s today and I'm hoping that inside

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.619 
70s today and I'm hoping that inside
there<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.599> doesn't<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.200> than<00:02:20.150> 80<00:02:21.150> or<00:02:21.390> 90

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
there it doesn't get more than 80 or 90

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.510 
there it doesn't get more than 80 or 90
degrees<00:02:22.170> I'll<00:02:22.410> put<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> probe<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.129> there<00:02:23.250> later

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
degrees I'll put a probe in there later

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.309 
degrees I'll put a probe in there later
and<00:02:23.790> check<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.120> out<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.660> now<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.050> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
and check it out but right now it's the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.120 
and check it out but right now it's the
the<00:02:25.800> dome<00:02:26.010> lid<00:02:26.280> feels<00:02:26.550> pretty<00:02:26.790> cool
