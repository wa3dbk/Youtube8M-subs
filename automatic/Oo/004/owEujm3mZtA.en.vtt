00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.920
 Igor Mayor Lenkom 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.920
 presents 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.270
 yes in our world is really all 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 mixed up and those people who used to 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.790
 were with money 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.070
 now left without money and some of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.190
 they gave you a loan, they ask me what 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 I do what I do if I gave 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.860
 in debt and I have not been returned here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.420
 Several variants 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 let's get these options right now 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 analyze means the first thing that you see 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.930
 when you lend money this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 means that you have too much money 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.540
 that you don't need them funny 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.360
 really there is that people 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.940
 who give money they give 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.190
 the money they don’t need because 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.680
 with this money they could make their 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.530
 life not that they could buy something 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 go learn to go relax and so 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.590
 further, but here lies such 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.740
 little energy hitch 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.260
 in most cases, people who 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.320
 lent money they were led on 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.420
 percent they thought but such 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.580
 large interest promise me or 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 any next pyramid like you 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.770
 such a huge interest and then blamed 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.910
 that people are to blame do not give money that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.970
 blame the pyramid that's how um memory i 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.760
 all sold apartment car invested a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.630
 they gave me nothing so understand that 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.220
 have invested not just a gift 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.620
 invested like to fuck with it 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.650
 and karma is very sensitive to this 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.470
 do you understand when people do it from 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.150
 selfish motives here a little 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.460
 differently if you 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
 some kind of neighbor gave for example 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 money and did not expect any 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
 percent that he will give them well 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 man needed money you had 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.800
 the money you gave him he asked issued 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.080
 all forget about them the money that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.050
 you gave it away you better forget 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 because here they are the money 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.760
 just will not be returned to you 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.050
 imagine that when you give that all 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.490
 never money 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.490
 these you will not see and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.460
 I will say more well you know what 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.790
 this context is very interesting 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.160
 it turns out it means as soon as you accept 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.390
 the decision that this money will not come to you 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.730
 they start coming to our trainings 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.190
 very often it was said that the water here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 the man didn't give me the money already there 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 ten years and then suddenly 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.870
 call on saturday night and talk i'm 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.330
 decided to give you money like this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.460
 acts at the level of karma like this with 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.840
 karma related see when you give 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.270
 money in debt means let's break it down 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 as I said first example then 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.280
 you selflessly lend when you 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.350
 selflessly give in debt then you get 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.020
 astern plus why because you 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:28.560
 serve people before serve people and when 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.890
 someone gives people with selfish ends 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.970
 gets in karma - why because 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.670
 the man who came to ask for a debt 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.240
 you know, he doesn't have enough energy 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.480
 something 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.700
 to get what he wants and therefore 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.980
 the easiest way to go 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.110
 borrow money take a loan from a bank and so 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.110
 further but this is the wrong way 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.310
 understand because this way you 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.750
 this person apply to freebies 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.910
 freebie pocket likes some freebies 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.670
 people deceive themselves the conclusion i eat the net 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.390
 meaning I wanted to help and do 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.080
 think think aha help seven percent in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.840
 a week 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.390
 well i help of course i help but 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.830
 all percent week 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.709
 now if you really want to help 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.650
 do it for free or at least 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.730
 no interest agree yes 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.440
 be sure to write a piece of paper that this 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.010
 man undertakes to return you so 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.250
 how do you credit this 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.460
 man I will tell you more that at all 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.360
 to lend it is not necessary to eat even such 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.930
 good proverb that says that 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.690
 want to lose a friend yes to them in debt and 2 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.979
 want to lose a friend take it in 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.660
 debt that is either so or usually 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.270
 that's what happens in my life 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.240
 There were several times and until when I took in 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.400
 debt u owed a lot and lent 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.930
 and I was not returned and I will not return that is 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.550
 such a mess was like that 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.070
 let's still 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.150
 let's summarize what happens if you don’t 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.000
 give money to someone you are nothing 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.180
 can not change 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.020
 give it right he won't give it away from 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.670
 you do not depend 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.800
 until what is called the remote control in 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.550
 the hands of this person will want he will press 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.840
 button will give will not want will not give in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.730
 my hands see the remote 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.390
 I'll click where the recording stops 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.490
 press the record button will go further and you 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.290
 can't change understand you can 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.570
 push a button so much on your 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:48.790
 side you can watch it and you can 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:52.090
 don't watch i'm telling you here 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.030
 smiles sits well ry 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.010
 listening but in a way that i can 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.620
 say when the remote is in your hands 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.080
 there is a goal depends on you again we see 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.110
 arrive at goals goals goals goals goals 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.110
 when the goal depends on you then everything is here 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.560
 well yes it turns out that you can 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.750
 direct this when you say that i am 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.230
 I give this money to my gratuitous 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.990
 to a friend because I love him because 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.910
 we are friends with him there from childhood and 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.940
 so on and so on and so forth then 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.720
 This one and when man says that I 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.120
 I give for free and he speaks about 10 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.729
 percent per month 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.940
 understand the difference here is the difference in 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.460
 the volume that here I am myself at interest 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.640
 when sold and sconces very much under 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.650
 interest 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.200
 so here be careful again 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.510
 I repeat that Karma does not like freebies 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.010
 as soon as you lend the man you 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:56.440
 already lost in karma because it is a debt 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.810
 you know yes and here are the debts 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.990
 karmically owes debts they are very strong 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.020
 related about this just I will detail 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:10.030
 telling at our training which 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:13.180
 called karma money 2 beginnings like 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.120
 times about how karmic is related 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.220
 debt and money debt we will do 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.350
 special exercise to 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.409
 find out what his karmic 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.689
 debts and 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:26.569
 cash debts so that's when you 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.369
 just donate for example for a day 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.279
 birth give a gift you do not 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:33.589
 wait and therefore feed in plus and when 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:35.209
 give in the house you expect that you return a 

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:38.179
 some are still waiting 

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:41.239
 what's back with interest is in feed 

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:45.789
 minus you should know this and now not 

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:45.789
 say you don't know like this
