00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
here we go here is the current files and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
here we go here is the current files and
stuff<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.920> everything<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.700> need

to make the thing actually goes make

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.209 
to make the thing actually goes make
this<00:00:43.739> full<00:00:43.950> screen<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> go

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this full screen so we're going to go

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.430 
this full screen so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.910> well<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.230> things

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
ahead and well this is where two things

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.029 
ahead and well this is where two things
could<00:00:49.649> happen

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
could happen

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
could happen
if<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> mod<00:00:50.879> installed

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you have a mod installed

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.500 
if you have a mod installed
automatically<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.050> mod<00:00:52.379> files<00:00:53.300> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
automatically go to mod files go to the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.340 
automatically go to mod files go to the
actual<00:00:54.870> mod<00:00:55.079> folder<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> common<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.350> then

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
actual mod folder go to common and then

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
actual mod folder go to common and then
there<00:00:58.620> should<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.829> something<00:00:58.980> called<00:00:59.190> defines

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
there should be something called defines

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.260 
there should be something called defines
its<00:01:00.960> ALU<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> file<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.520> double<00:01:02.910> click<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
its ALU a file just double click on that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.440 
its ALU a file just double click on that
it'll<00:01:03.570> bring<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> gigantic<00:01:05.450> gigantic

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it'll bring up this gigantic gigantic

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
it'll bring up this gigantic gigantic
piece<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> text<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.159> coding<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
piece of text now this is all coding to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.070 
piece of text now this is all coding to
make<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.390> work<00:01:11.510> what<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> now

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.860 
and it'll come up and keep clicking find
next<00:03:50.769> until<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.129> find<00:03:51.609> no<00:03:52.560> no<00:03:53.579> no<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.750> will

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
next until you find no no no this will

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.059 
next until you find no no no this will
make<00:03:56.019> things<00:03:56.199> a<00:03:56.319> little<00:03:56.379> bit<00:03:56.530> faster<00:03:56.979> I<00:03:57.040> think

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
make things a little bit faster I think

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.140 
make things a little bit faster I think
but<00:03:57.810> here<00:03:58.810> we<00:03:58.900> go<00:03:59.019> CB<00:03:59.879> construction<00:04:00.879> speed

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
but here we go CB construction speed

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.059 
but here we go CB construction speed
right<00:04:01.389> over<00:04:01.709> here<00:04:02.709> oh<00:04:03.000> that's<00:04:04.000> great<00:04:04.209> war<00:04:04.510> ah

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
right over here oh that's great war ah

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.460 
right over here oh that's great war ah
so<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.129> did<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.430> wrong<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:08.049> in<00:04:08.260> here

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
so I did that wrong but in here

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.740 
so I did that wrong but in here
somewhere<00:04:08.709> there's<00:04:08.979> something<00:04:09.280> called<00:04:09.459> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
somewhere there's something called a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.050 
somewhere there's something called a
construct<00:04:10.750> actually<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.169> might<00:04:11.319> be<00:04:11.470> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
construct actually that might be it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.420 
construct actually that might be it
well<00:04:13.060> great<00:04:13.359> yeah<00:04:13.599> that's<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.139> great<00:04:14.260> war<00:04:14.560> but

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
well great yeah that's a great war but

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.710 
well great yeah that's a great war but
there's<00:04:15.609> things<00:04:15.790> like<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.449> make<00:04:16.570> it

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
there's things like that you can make it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.399 
there's things like that you can make it
so<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.019> it's<00:04:17.409> super<00:04:17.769> fast<00:04:17.949> that's<00:04:18.370> what<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.549> do

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
so that it's super fast that's what I do

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.870 
so that it's super fast that's what I do
pops<00:04:20.409> I<00:04:20.709> don't<00:04:20.979> really<00:04:21.159> touch<00:04:21.370> any<00:04:21.639> of<00:04:21.760> that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
pops I don't really touch any of that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.700 
pops I don't really touch any of that
because<00:04:22.060> if<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.479> touch<00:04:22.719> any<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.529> will

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
because if you touch any of it you will

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.649 
because if you touch any of it you will
probably<00:04:24.400> be<00:04:24.639> screwed<00:04:24.969> you<00:04:25.210> could<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.479> this

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
probably be screwed you could do this

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:26.330 
probably be screwed you could do this
kind<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:25.960> stuff

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
kind of stuff

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.790 
kind of stuff
I can<00:04:26.520> change<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.850> rebels<00:04:27.150> up<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.620> don't

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
I can change the rebels up the a I don't

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500 
I can change the rebels up the a I don't
even<00:04:29.430> don't<00:04:29.790> even<00:04:29.850> think<00:04:30.180> about

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
even don't even think about

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.570 
even don't even think about

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
touching this this will you up that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
touching this this will you up that
will<00:04:32.730> completely<00:04:33.150> destroy<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.710> ignore<00:04:34.710> that
