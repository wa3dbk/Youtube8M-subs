00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
doesn't make much sense to me that this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
doesn't make much sense to me that this
is<00:01:52.170> something<00:01:52.320> human<00:01:52.680> wearing<00:01:52.920> his<00:01:53.040> downtime

you can see not only is this wig or to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
you can see not only is this wig or to
pay<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.690> maybe<00:02:17.990> it's<00:02:18.200> his<00:02:18.260> hair<00:02:18.500> that's<00:02:18.680> been

pay or maybe it's his hair that's been
straightened<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
straightened and you know this is the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.240 
straightened and you know this is the
look<00:02:20.390> they've<00:02:20.569> given<00:02:20.780> him<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.040> think

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
look they've given him which I think

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
look they've given him which I think
actually<00:02:22.430> would<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:22.880> my<00:02:23.060> guess<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.660> this

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
actually would be my guess I think this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 
actually would be my guess I think this
is<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.350> they've<00:02:24.500> actually<00:02:24.680> done<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
is what they've actually done this to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.210 
is what they've actually done this to
jesse<00:02:25.640> eisenberg<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.290> darkish<00:02:27.950> red

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
jesse eisenberg but it's a darkish red

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.370 
jesse eisenberg but it's a darkish red
he<00:02:28.610> has<00:02:28.730> red<00:02:29.030> hair<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:30.170> only<00:02:30.290> that

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
he has red hair here and not only that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.960 
he has red hair here and not only that
but<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.890> noticed<00:02:31.280> something<00:02:31.520> else<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:31.850> off

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
but if I noticed something else was off

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.420 
but if I noticed something else was off
about<00:02:32.150> him<00:02:32.420> his<00:02:32.930> eyebrows<00:02:33.740> have<00:02:34.040> been<00:02:34.220> dyed

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
about him his eyebrows have been dyed

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.490 
about him his eyebrows have been dyed
red<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.330> think<00:02:35.510> they<00:02:35.930> took<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.320> some

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
red so I think they took like some

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.380 
red so I think they took like some
japanese<00:02:36.980> straightening<00:02:37.670> technique<00:02:38.209> which

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
japanese straightening technique which

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.820 
japanese straightening technique which
is<00:02:38.540> something<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> lot<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.020> which<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.680> used

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
is something a lot of which is used

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.740 
is something a lot of which is used
quite<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.400> lot<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.610> hairstyles<00:02:41.330> these<00:02:41.540> days

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
quite a lot in hairstyles these days

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.449 
quite a lot in hairstyles these days
it's<00:02:42.500> something<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.920> don't<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.250> blow

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
it's something so you don't have to blow

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.280 
it's something so you don't have to blow
out<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> hair<00:02:43.910> every<00:02:44.209> day<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.570> keeps<00:02:45.170> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
out the hair every day it keeps it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.690 
out the hair every day it keeps it
straight<00:02:45.590> even<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.070> gets<00:02:46.220> wet<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.670> a

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
straight even when it gets wet for a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.340 
straight even when it gets wet for a
couple<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.000> months<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.959> think<00:02:48.200> they've

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
couple of months and I think they've

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.470 
couple of months and I think they've
straightened<00:02:48.890> Jesse<00:02:49.130> Eisenberg's<00:02:49.640> hair<00:02:49.850> dyed

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
straightened Jesse Eisenberg's hair dyed

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.240 
straightened Jesse Eisenberg's hair dyed
it<00:02:50.630> dark<00:02:50.660> red<00:02:51.080> along<00:02:51.350> with<00:02:51.500> his<00:02:51.620> eyebrows<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.400

think you have to give him credit for
doing<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.239> pretty<00:02:56.420> darn<00:02:56.600> good<00:02:56.750> job<00:02:56.870> styling<00:02:57.650> in

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
doing a pretty darn good job styling in

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.009 
doing a pretty darn good job styling in

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
himself when he's not on set this might

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.170 
himself when he's not on set this might
be<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:00.170> how<00:03:00.410> Jesse<00:03:00.680> Eisenberg<00:03:01.220> likes<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.610> he

be just how Jesse Eisenberg likes it he

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.729 
be just how Jesse Eisenberg likes it he
might<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.540> slicked<00:03:02.870> back<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.500> film

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
might have it slicked back in the film

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.410 
might have it slicked back in the film
to<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.100> more<00:03:04.280> corporate<00:03:04.610> raider<00:03:04.940> look<00:03:05.180> we

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
to have a more corporate raider look we

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.970 
to have a more corporate raider look we
don't<00:03:05.570> know<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.530> he's<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> redhead

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980

don't know but I think he's a redhead
and<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.580> think<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.180> not<00:03:08.330> be<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> wig<00:03:08.750> I

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
and I think it's going to not be a wig I

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.380 
and I think it's going to not be a wig I
think<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:09.350> going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.680> his<00:03:10.550> actual<00:03:10.850> look

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.400 
film but I think it's a very interesting
direction<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.150> go<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.140> think<00:03:33.320> it
