00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.799
 this video tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.519
 make this pretty flower made with a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.400
 can of soda well let's see how it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 make the materials that we will use 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 will be a can of scissors and scissors 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 glue we will take our cans of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.640
 soda and cut the bottom with 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 scissors help fine now 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 we will take our can and make a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.010
 cut vertically from the bottom 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 towards the top 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.230
 to where is this neck that 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.520
 it forms the upper part and likewise 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.850
 we will cut the top part by this 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850
 neck 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.710
 already cut will remain this way and 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.300
 what we will do is roll it up 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.040
 so that in this way the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.020
 more than you can and then 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.909
 we will cut the edges the most right 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.850
 that we can 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.829
 well and then we will make the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:26.140
 following cuts first a strip 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.140
 about one and a half centimeters 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 and a second strip of approximately 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 half centimeter 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.880
 we will take the two strips and leave them 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.010
 aside for a moment we will work on 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.560
 what will be our petals and 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.830
 we will take what we have left over from 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.400
 aluminum and we'll fold it in half 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.200
 this way very carefully 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.800
 and with the help of our scissors 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 we press hard the bend 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.330
 well now we unfold 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 and what we will do is fold and unfold 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.040
 for aluminum thus this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.840
 cut 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:23.200
 and does not have a sharp edge now we will take a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.800
 piece and we will fold it again 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 in the middle we press with the scissors 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.680
 and we will do the same procedure 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.090
 opening it and closing it to cut the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.040
 aluminum 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 well this way and we will do the same 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.520
 with the other half 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.590
 once the other half was cut we 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.129
 four pieces will remain 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.080
 that will be our petals well 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:03.220
 we will take one and what we will do is 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.670
 fold it half by the color by 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.670
 inside 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.630
 but this time we will not press 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.750
 only with the hand 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.590
 in this way we take our scissors 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.580
 and what we will do is round 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.580
 this corner 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 and the other 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.410
 well and in the center part what 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.410
 we will do is make a semicircle 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.109
 thus we do the same with with 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.879
 us three pieces 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.370
 now let's join our petals 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.730
 taking the half centimeter strip that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.239
 we cut previously we introduced 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.239
 in a 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.290
 and what we will do is give it a spin 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.939
 we take another petal 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.939
 we will take another turn 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.480
 we will take another petal 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.250
 and finally the last 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.620
 and roll up we have the strip 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.620
 until we have approximately 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.739
 two centimeters 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.919
 thus 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.090
 now we will give shape to our flower 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.090
 opening our petals a little 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.720
 in this way and what we will do is open 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.730
 pushing a little 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.590
 in this way we will do the same with 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.590
 all our petals 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.650
 well and once finished we will be left with 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.050
 this form we will leave it aside 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.909
 moment we will take 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.430
 the one and a half strip that we had 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.669
 cut previously and with scissors 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.800
 we will cut through the bottom 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.099
 approximately two centimeters by the 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.099
 half 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.569
 in this way and then we 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.020
 we will double with the color of aluminum 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.020
 inside 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:11.180
 in this way we take our flower and what 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.180
 What we will do is enter this tab 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.839
 thus 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.260
 well and to hold it firmly what 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.660
 we will do is go for a walk 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.660
 to the flower with our stem 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 thus 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.879
 well to make the base of our flower 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.460
 we will take the top part and 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:47.069
 we will remove 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.069
 this piece and the one below 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.170
 and with our scissors we will make cuts 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.330
 and inclined 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.289
 in this way 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.289
 for all 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:08.710
 around 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.710
 ok and now we will open a little 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.030
 tabs 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.289
 thus 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.680
 we double 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:23.639
 what we had cut earlier and 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.420
 we will put some glue 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:30.390
 to fasten it to our base 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.840
 once finished we will have this 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.550
 shape 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.340
