I'm going to take two of the ads and
ones<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.630> believe<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> would<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> take<00:02:31.350> on

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
ones I believe I would have to take on

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.700 
ones I believe I would have to take on
Baron<00:02:32.580> Riven<00:02:32.940> they're<00:02:33.120> driven<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.260> are<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
Baron Riven they're driven they are and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
Baron Riven they're driven they are and
one<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> other<00:02:35.910> ones<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.270> can't<00:02:36.450> remember

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
one of the other ones I can't remember

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.000 
one of the other ones I can't remember
so<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.910> was<00:02:39.240> supposed<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.750> tricky<00:02:40.020> taking

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
so that was supposed to be tricky taking

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
so that was supposed to be tricky taking
on<00:02:41.100> two<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.550> ads<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:41.970> once<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:42.360> kill<00:02:42.510> both

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
on two of the ads but once we kill both

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
on two of the ads but once we kill both
the<00:02:42.780> ads<00:02:43.080> then<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> other<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.430> ads<00:02:44.640> which<00:02:45.060> are

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the ads then the other two ads which are

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.300 
the ads then the other two ads which are
in<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> far<00:02:45.570> end<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.900> room<00:02:46.050> stay<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.710> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
in the far end of the room stay there so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.650 
in the far end of the room stay there so
we<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.580> take<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.210> ads<00:02:48.390> off

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660

separately<00:02:49.290> after<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:51.110> but<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.260> main<00:02:52.410> thing

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
separately after that but the main thing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.550 
separately after that but the main thing
is<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:53.130> getting<00:02:53.340> both<00:02:53.580> these<00:02:53.760> ads<00:02:53.970> down<00:02:54.560> and
