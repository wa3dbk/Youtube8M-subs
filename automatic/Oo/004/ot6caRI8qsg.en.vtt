what's<00:00:00.269> up<00:00:00.359> everybody<00:00:01.050> well<00:00:01.350> today<00:00:01.920> we're

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
what's up everybody well today we're

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.260 
what's up everybody well today we're
doing<00:00:02.340> something<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> little<00:00:02.639> bit<00:00:02.879> different

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
doing something a little bit different

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.210 
doing something a little bit different
what<00:00:03.720> we're<00:00:03.899> doing<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.500> replacing<00:00:04.740> this

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
what we're doing is we're replacing this

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.020 
what we're doing is we're replacing this
engine<00:00:06.029> coolant<00:00:06.450> temperature<00:00:06.899> sensor<00:00:07.319> and

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
engine coolant temperature sensor and

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.089 
engine coolant temperature sensor and
it's<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.510> thing<00:00:09.750> right<00:00:10.050> here<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.710> sensor

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
it's this thing right here this sensor

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.209 
it's this thing right here this sensor
is<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.660> computer<00:00:13.440> uses<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.040> determine

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
is what the computer uses to determine

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.450 
is what the computer uses to determine
the<00:00:15.120> coolant<00:00:15.540> temperature<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the coolant temperature this is not the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.929 
the coolant temperature this is not the
sensor<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.710> tells<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> gauge<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
sensor that tells the gauge what the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.759 
sensor that tells the gauge what the
coolant<00:00:21.270> temperature<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.410> its<00:00:22.650> own

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
coolant temperature is that's its own

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.070 
coolant temperature is that's its own
entity<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> bunch<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
entity right there I've got a bunch of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660 
entity right there I've got a bunch of
stuff<00:00:25.260> apart<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> middle<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> big

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
stuff apart I'm in the middle of a big

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.359 
stuff apart I'm in the middle of a big
cooling<00:00:27.090> system<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:28.410> overall<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> big

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
cooling system not overall but a big

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
cooling system not overall but a big
cooling<00:00:29.730> system<00:00:30.170> repair<00:00:31.170> job<00:00:31.439> I've<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
cooling system repair job I've got a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.229 
cooling system repair job I've got a
little<00:00:31.980> clip<00:00:32.279> right<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:34.020> holds<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
little clip right here that holds the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.580 
little clip right here that holds the
connector<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> sensor<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
connector on the sensor I'm just going

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
connector on the sensor I'm just going
to<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> little<00:00:37.980> pic<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.149> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> pull

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to take a little pic and kind of pull

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.619 
to take a little pic and kind of pull
back<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:40.129> at<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> same<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:41.489> rock<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:43.250 
back on at the same time rock this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 

and<00:00:43.770> pop<00:00:44.070> him<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and pop him off of there one thing I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
and pop him off of there one thing I
like<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.590> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:47.969> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
like to do is I kind of like to kind of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
like to do is I kind of like to kind of
try<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> remember<00:00:48.980> where<00:00:49.980> everything<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
try to remember where everything was

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
try to remember where everything was
oriented<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.110> imagine<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
oriented if you can imagine that the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.209 
oriented if you can imagine that the
little<00:00:53.789> titty<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.449> top<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> connector<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little titty on top of the connector so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
little titty on top of the connector so
if<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.399> facing<00:00:56.640> basically<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.690> o'clock

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
if it's facing basically two o'clock

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
if it's facing basically two o'clock
I'll<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.559> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> mental<00:00:59.820> note<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I'll just kind of take a mental note of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:19.260 
I'll just kind of take a mental note of
that<00:01:01.370> I've<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> 19<00:01:03.149> millimeter<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:04.080> wrench

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.999 

I<00:01:19.390> wasn't<00:01:20.020> really<00:01:20.289> anything<00:01:20.500> wrong<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
I wasn't really anything wrong with the

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.399 
I wasn't really anything wrong with the
sensor<00:01:21.429> but<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.909> had<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.179> lot<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.810> stuff<00:01:23.049> apart

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
sensor but I had a lot of stuff apart

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.520 
sensor but I had a lot of stuff apart
the<00:01:24.100> trucks<00:01:24.340> got<00:01:24.899> 160,000<00:01:25.899> miles<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.259> it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
the trucks got 160,000 miles on it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.700 
the trucks got 160,000 miles on it
it's<00:01:27.189> 15<00:01:27.549> years<00:01:27.579> old<00:01:27.969> so<00:01:28.299> I<00:01:28.450> figure<00:01:28.929> why<00:01:29.679> not

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
it's 15 years old so I figure why not

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.289 
it's 15 years old so I figure why not
just<00:01:29.860> replace<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.490> sensor<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.000> our<00:01:34.149> new

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
just replace the sensor this is our new

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.730 
just replace the sensor this is our new
one<00:01:34.950> everything<00:01:35.950> looks<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.219> same<00:01:37.679> this<00:01:38.679> is

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
one everything looks the same this is

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.559 
one everything looks the same this is
the<00:01:40.170> part<00:01:41.170> number<00:01:41.469> of<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.950> one<00:01:42.130> minimizing

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.639 

installations<00:01:49.569> pretty<00:01:49.840> much<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.170> reverse<00:01:50.289> of

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
installations pretty much the reverse of

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.979 
installations pretty much the reverse of
removal<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.849> tightened<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.239> as<00:01:52.599> much<00:01:52.840> as

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
removal kind of tightened it as much as

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.990 
removal kind of tightened it as much as
I<00:01:53.049> could<00:01:53.229> by<00:01:53.409> hand<00:01:53.679> once<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.520> threadlocker

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
I could by hand once the threadlocker

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600 
I could by hand once the threadlocker
started<00:01:55.569> a<00:01:55.739> biting<00:01:56.739> getting<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.340> little<00:01:57.520> bit

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
started a biting getting a little bit

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.300 
started a biting getting a little bit
harder<00:01:57.849> to<00:01:57.880> turn<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.619> went<00:01:59.860> back<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.130> my

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
harder to turn so I went back to my

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.039 
harder to turn so I went back to my
wrench<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:03.009> going<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.220> go<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:04.450> clip<00:02:04.840> at

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
wrench and it's going to go one clip at

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.580 
wrench and it's going to go one clip at
a<00:02:05.110> time<00:02:08.399> while<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.549> turn<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.910> winch<00:02:10.030> room<00:02:10.590> cuz

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
a time while you turn the winch room cuz

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.770 
a time while you turn the winch room cuz
I'm<00:02:11.739> bottomed<00:02:11.920> out<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.910> got<00:02:13.630> like

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
I'm bottomed out right here I got like

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.350 
I'm bottomed out right here I got like
this<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.290> can't<00:02:15.190> get<00:02:15.340> another<00:02:15.579> bite<00:02:15.880> on<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
this I can't get another bite on it so
