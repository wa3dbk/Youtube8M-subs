00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.540
 1st channel then you are 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.470

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.920
 letter 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.330
 you about your life and polygamy take 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.110
 marry us show pity for us 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.480
 protect us from the cold loneliness 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.460
 when i got close to 20 year old 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 age 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.270
 like any girl dreamed of young 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 fellow observant canons of religion with 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.710
 Noble- minded pondered build 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 dreams how we live 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 raise children and so on and I always 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 arguing with brother and sometimes with uncle o 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 polygamy they tried to convince 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 me but I was stubborn 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 and did not want to listen and told them that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.290
 absolutely impossible 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.330
 so that with my husband's life participated more 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.930
 one woman is absolutely impossible that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.990
 both separated your husband from the other 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.530
 sometimes my fault caused problems 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.670
 between other married couples because 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.510
 that husbands wanted to marry again and I 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.300
 set the Agen against his husbands 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.530
 to get them wracked with anger against 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.640
 such a decision 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.420
 but years have passed in dreams and waiting 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.610
 I waited for a prince on a white horse 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 and he was late but I kept waiting 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.979
 on the threshold already 30 years old 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.649
 oh my gosh what do i do 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:03.130

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.299
 shameless so what do i do to me 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 it only remains to wait 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.300
 I once heard one of the women 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.260
 sitting near me 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.459
 said such and such became old maiden and i 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:27.850
 the poor thing said to herself 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:32.350
 old maidens however so this is me they 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.160
 talked about me oh god this is me 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.330
 so name 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.810
 I became an old maiden what a terrible blow 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:46.190
 no matter how I describe you never 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.010
 feel this i have come before the fact 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.880
 and i'm an old maid 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.470
 I began to think about how to be 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.790
 what do i do time go days go by 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.800
 I want to scream about my pain and I 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.300
 I want a husband 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.730
 husband whose loss and i will be 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.680
 which will help me and which 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.740
 will solve my problems I want to live 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.810
 I want to have children enjoy my 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.380
 life one day my older brother 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.420
 comes to me and says 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.500
 today came a man something 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 ask for you but I refused him not 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.050
 think about your words and I 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.050
 exclaimed why aren't you ashamed 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.739
 he answered me because he wanted to take 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.120
 you 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.110
 second wife and I know that you are against 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.670
 polygamy and I almost screamed at him 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.570
 face 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 but why did not you agree I agree 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:08.260
 be 2 3 or 4 wife 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.470
 but now I have comprehended the wisdom of religion in 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.690
 polygamy and this is just one 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.860
 wisdom that made me 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.910
 to agree 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.530
 but what about his other wisdoms about 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:28.120
 Allah forgive me my sins are truly and I 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:33.669
 was ignorant and lonely men marry 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 by 1 2 3 and 4 when available and 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.300
 subject to justice 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.380
 save us from darkness loneliness 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.000
 we are people like you 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:51.940
 feel and experience pain protect us 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.360
 show us pity and this appeal 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.810
 and I send to my married sister 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.550
 Muslim women praising Allah for that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.830
 mercy 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.850
 thanks to which you have not experienced flour 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:11.139
 old maidens or women left without 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.479
 husband and I ask you not to get angry and if 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.070
 your husband will want to take a wife 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:21.970
 one more does not hinder him 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.500
 on the contrary incited him to this and I know 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.110
 that it is difficult for you but I hope she 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.230
 reward 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.730
 and look at your sisters' condition by 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:38.540
 faith among which there are old maidens 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:42.590
 divorced widows consider them their own 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:47.990
 sisters and you will get great 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:51.500
 a reward for your patience maybe you 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.520
 tell me there is a free one for her 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.180
 man and take wives and i say 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.890
 you see statistics 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.140
 population truly 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.420
 the number of women is much higher than men and 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.070
 if every man will marry 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.150
 just one wife then most women 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.430
 will remain unmarried 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:22.670
 old maids do not think only about yourself 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.450
 think of us too dying of strong 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.010
 anger 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.350
 when I see my husband holding his hand 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.220
 wife 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:36.620
 my feelings rebel however useless not 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.220
 is a secret to no one 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.220
 the benefits of polygamy are truly 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:47.180
 she is one of the strongest 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.940
 pillars preserve chastity and one of 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.150
 the greatest ways 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:56.930
 bringing good grace and increasing 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.160
 buzzing and know the owners of faith and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.060
 knowledge 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.050
 and if you don't have the courage for 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.200
 polygamy 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.680
 send it to someone you think 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.450
 the owner of such courage 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.670
 your unmarried sister 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.670
