00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.639

 coveted within the world of 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.820
 perfumery is the beam mix or also 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.610
 known as a mask let's see what it is 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.070
 where does it come from to be so expensive and the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.460
 negative part of this substance the 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.410
 natural musk is extracted from a 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.030
 gland that owns the musk deer 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.129
 male that is this animal that are 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.270
 seeing in the picture it says that this 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.450
 substance has two qualities 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.570

 attract female sex and quality 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.480
 most appreciated within the world of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.520
 Perfumery is that it is a powerful fixative 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.770
 that is, it is able to prevent them from evaporating 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.810
 much more volatile substances between the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.390
 so special and characteristic smell that 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.930
 has the mixture that ability to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.280
 attracting the female sex and its ability 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.050
 for the fixation of another substance 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 understands is because he admits 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.280
 the negative part of 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.930
 all this topic that I have been commenting on 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.390
 is that to extract the gland from 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.170
 musk deer have to kill the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.630
 animal this has made me have to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.660
 regulate its use for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 avoid those indiscriminate killings and 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.060
 the extinction of this type of species 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.570
 fortunately, technology has 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.280
 started to develop administres 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.370
 synthetics that have come to replace 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.510
 the natural is what is called 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.640
 like milk beam white or white 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.110
 more than these synthetic substances 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.470

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.470

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.830
 Perfumery has become aware that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.160
 it is not reasonable to punish animals 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 in this way and even in perfumes 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.310
 very well 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.470
