I tried to design it around not to be a
chore<00:04:40.969> to<00:04:41.029> drink<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.599> you're<00:04:41.719> not<00:04:41.779> just<00:04:41.840> chug

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
chore to drink so you're not just chug

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.920

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
a liter of actual shake so I tried to

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.260 
a liter of actual shake so I tried to
design<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.860> around<00:04:49.159> that<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.729> saw<00:04:49.939> a<00:04:49.969> price
