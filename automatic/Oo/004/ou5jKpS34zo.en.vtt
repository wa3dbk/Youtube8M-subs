00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
next time on this album try it out the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.719 
next time on this album try it out the
try<00:03:45.449> harder<00:03:45.780> remix<00:03:46.229> I've<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:47.009> I've<00:03:47.310> heard<00:03:47.519> a

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
try harder remix I've all I've heard a

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.369 
try harder remix I've all I've heard a
little<00:03:47.879> bit<00:03:48.000> before<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.479> Adam<00:03:48.780> came<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.139> and

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
little bit before this Adam came out and

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.710 
little bit before this Adam came out and
I<00:03:49.829> think<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.370> version<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.479> little

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
I think that this version is a little

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.229 
I think that this version is a little
bit<00:03:52.049> more<00:03:52.199> classic<00:03:52.709> Skrillex<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.699> I<00:03:53.759> think<00:03:54.030> a

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
bit more classic Skrillex and I think a

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.119 
bit more classic Skrillex and I think a
whole<00:03:54.569> lot<00:03:54.599> of<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> classic<00:03:55.500> Skrillex<00:03:55.889> fans

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
whole lot of the classic Skrillex fans

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.429 
whole lot of the classic Skrillex fans
are<00:03:56.340> going<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.790> kind<00:03:57.449> of<00:03:57.540> move<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.229> try

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
are going to kind of move on to the try

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.409 
are going to kind of move on to the try
harder<00:03:58.769> remix<00:03:59.099> because<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.579> neon<00:03:59.879> remix<00:04:00.269> on

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
harder remix because the neon remix on

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.719 
harder remix because the neon remix on
this<00:04:00.629> album<00:04:00.810> doesn't<00:04:01.500> go<00:04:01.799> near<00:04:02.099> as<00:04:02.220> hard<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.609> to

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
this album doesn't go near as hard as to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.460 
this album doesn't go near as hard as to
try<00:04:02.939> harder<00:04:03.239> remixed<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.290> old

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
try harder remixed so if you like old

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.439 
try harder remixed so if you like old
Skrillex<00:04:04.919> go<00:04:05.250> trial<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.639> try<00:04:05.819> harder<00:04:06.090> remix

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
Skrillex go trial to try harder remix

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.659 
Skrillex go trial to try harder remix
but<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.750> neon<00:04:07.019> mix<00:04:07.259> is<00:04:07.409> also<00:04:07.829> i<00:04:08.069> think<00:04:08.250> really

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
but the neon mix is also i think really

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.089 
but the neon mix is also i think really
good<00:04:08.970> honestly<00:04:09.419> i<00:04:09.750> like<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.349> neon<00:04:10.530> mix<00:04:10.919> on

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
this album because i think it fits more

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.449 
this album because i think it fits more
with<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.470> rest<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.919> songs<00:04:14.159> that<00:04:14.280> are

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
rude if the trihard remix was put on

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.449 
rude if the trihard remix was put on
this<00:04:18.419> thing<00:04:18.659> but<00:04:18.930> nevertheless<00:04:19.470> it's<00:04:20.070> there

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
from chance the rapper it sounds a

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.200 
from chance the rapper it sounds a
little<00:04:32.100> bit<00:04:32.190> choppy<00:04:32.580> there<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.120> beginning

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
little bit choppy there in the beginning

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.850 
little bit choppy there in the beginning
and<00:04:33.630> something<00:04:33.930> seems<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.259> little<00:04:34.410> bit<00:04:34.590> off

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
and something seems a little bit off

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.980 
and something seems a little bit off
about<00:04:34.889> it<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.699> as<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.030> track<00:04:36.270> goes<00:04:36.479> on<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.690> get

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
about it but as the track goes on I get

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.600 
about it but as the track goes on I get
more<00:04:37.169> used<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.889> I<00:04:37.979> just<00:04:38.190> think<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.520> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
more used to it and I just think it's a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.670 
more used to it and I just think it's a
really<00:04:38.759> fast<00:04:39.090> moving<00:04:39.360> punchy<00:04:39.840> track<00:04:40.139> with
