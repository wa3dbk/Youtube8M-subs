into<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.660> floral<00:00:40.649> design<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.280> white

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
into a little floral design with white

and<00:00:41.760> purple<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> blue<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.710> how<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and purple and blue and I like how it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
and purple and blue and I like how it
incorporates<00:00:44.280> black<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> white<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
incorporates black and white so you can

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
incorporates black and white so you can
wear<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.649> more<00:00:46.829> dressy<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
wear it for more dressy things but the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600 
wear it for more dressy things but the
way<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.960> makes<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> more<00:00:49.410> summery<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
way also makes it more summery and I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
way also makes it more summery and I
think<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.940> dress<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.390> perfect<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
think this dress would be perfect to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.450 
think this dress would be perfect to
wear<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> dinner<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:52.829> something<00:00:52.980> because

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
wear out to dinner or something because

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
wear out to dinner or something because
like<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.850> said<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.210> still<00:00:54.300> dressy<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.860> it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
like I said it's still dressy but it's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
like I said it's still dressy but it's
summary<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.449> comfy<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.350> works

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
summary and it's so comfy so it works
