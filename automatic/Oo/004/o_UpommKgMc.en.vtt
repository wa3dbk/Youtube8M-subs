00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.070
 today's daily task four and a half 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.799
 hours currently has workpiece is off 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.690
 steer long drive everywhere without me 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.490
 think he has trained on it you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.060
 have ten minutes now this time 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 drawings to study from now in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.350
 the stuttgart messehallen carry the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.310
 best apprentices of metalworking the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.529
 national preliminary round in cnc turn out of the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 winner may in 2013 to the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.989
 world championships in Leipzig 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 join the worldskills here 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.910
 within four and a half hours 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.500
 Such a device workpiece to create 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 to produce the machines 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 First of all, a program has to be done 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 that is the candidate 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 This technical drawing takes all 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.820
 details for the program write this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.170
 program ex on the pc 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.810
 this program must be peter on the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.370
 machine dubbing the machine equip 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.920
 must connect 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.990
 this tool dimensionally finished here 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.430
 do you see such a finished part that 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.630
 muscle within four and a half hours 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.570
 be made and we see here 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.550
 once the original judgment itself 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.710
 the trainees are in the national 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.200
 have come with a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.640
 to fight such a difficult task 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 very challenging 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.880
 must be 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 and there you have to make small mistakes and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 then the time is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.620
 a few meters further, the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 championship in cnc milling take place 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.270
 it is a different kind of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.130
 metalworking among the curious 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
 view of the visitors 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 in the middle of the hustle and bustle try the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.950
 lines as well as possible 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 to call your performance many visitors 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 which is still ahead of the competition and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.289
 for the stands are interested 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.509
 huge mirror 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.090
 it's suddenly thunderstorms and cameras 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.729
 that makes it so difficult for me to do that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.289
 but also in 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.580
 The company is working conditions 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.890
 often not without 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 the competition is for the next generation 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.150
 also a good exercise for the later 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 old operation over the conditions are 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.910
 just something completely different if the whole 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 time people stand behind one and around 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.980
 run around but otherwise that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.900
 same when practicing a company itself that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.510
 an apprentice the tasks in this 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 challenging competition 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.360
 one hundred percent solving rarely happens 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.080
 in front 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.370
 is not perfect 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 it was like the cutting length of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 Then we have with laser light 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.650
 nevertheless, I am pushing the market 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.340
 Confident because others make people 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.530
 also mistakes 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.110
 After the competition, the work will be done 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.970
 On the one hand , the precision is what we want 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.610
 the workpieces read by machine 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.710
 second, an experienced jury awards 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.860
 for the inspection of the workpieces to 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.390
 to ten points is the first page 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.550
 actually ever wonderful these are 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.950
 not quite 50 percent because there are a few 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.930
 Less elements are the second page 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.570
 are the mailman there are a few things 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.490
 but some of them do not fit 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.740
 that's why I do not give them the six 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.060
 Bad for the beginning but it remains 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.209
 still up 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.800
 and there are still more tasks 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.390
 Only after three days are the winners 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.780
 firmly Germany at the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 may represent world championships 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.890
 2013 in Leipzig
