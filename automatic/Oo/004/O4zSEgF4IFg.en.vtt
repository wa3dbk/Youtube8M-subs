Make a cut in this area.

Go over the broken lines with a dotter in order to make easier to fold the box.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:05:40.680
Take a bit of trasparent sheet. 
Then stick it in that area with a biadhesive scotch tape.
Cut it in pieces to be put along the sides.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:55.200
Now let's fold it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:43.920
Put on this part some biadhesive scotch tape.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:07:14.200
Stick inner wings to the sides of the box, in this way.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:56.600
Decorate the box according to your taste.
