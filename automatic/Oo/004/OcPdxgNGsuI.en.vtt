I want to ramble a little bit about what
really<00:00:14.510> makes<00:00:14.930> a<00:00:15.170> game<00:00:15.380> will<00:00:15.620> last<00:00:15.650> a<00:00:16.280> what

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
really makes a game will last a what

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.820 
really makes a game will last a what
really<00:00:16.700> gives<00:00:16.820> it<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.090> lasting<00:00:17.570> appeal<00:00:18.110> now<00:00:18.740> the

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
really gives it a lasting appeal now the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.650 
really gives it a lasting appeal now the
thing<00:00:18.950> about<00:00:19.310> Minecraft<00:00:20.029> that<00:00:20.270> I<00:00:20.300> really

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
thing about Minecraft that I really

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.260 
thing about Minecraft that I really
think<00:00:20.990> makes<00:00:21.439> it<00:00:21.650> last<00:00:21.860> is<00:00:22.279> I<00:00:22.460> mean<00:00:22.850> yeah<00:00:23.060> it's

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
think makes it last is I mean yeah it's

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.179 
think makes it last is I mean yeah it's
a<00:00:23.360> fun<00:00:23.570> game<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.900> build<00:00:24.350> blocks<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:24.950> really

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
a fun game to build blocks it's really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.220 
a fun game to build blocks it's really
fun<00:00:25.550> but<00:00:26.000> I<00:00:26.060> don't<00:00:26.180> think<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.869> key

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
fun but I don't think that is the key

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.290 
fun but I don't think that is the key
factor<00:00:27.590> in<00:00:27.860> what<00:00:28.160> really<00:00:28.369> makes<00:00:28.579> minecraft<00:00:29.150> a

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
factor in what really makes minecraft a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.960 
factor in what really makes minecraft a
fantastic<00:00:30.050> game<00:00:30.259> I<00:00:30.529> think<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.279> key<00:00:31.460> factor<00:00:31.939> in

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
fantastic game I think the key factor in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.319 
fantastic game I think the key factor in
it<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.870> fact<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:33.620> gets<00:00:33.950> updates<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
it is the fact that it gets updates the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.300 
it is the fact that it gets updates the
fact<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.840> people<00:00:36.260> can<00:00:36.440> check<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:36.950> out<00:00:37.070> in

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
fact that people can check it out in

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.910 
fact that people can check it out in
like<00:00:37.489> an<00:00:37.640> alpha<00:00:38.090> stage<00:00:38.360> like<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:38.899> did<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.470> then

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
like an alpha stage like I did and then

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.190

play<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.220> on<00:00:40.430> PC<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:40.910> alpha<00:00:41.450> stage<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:42.080> then

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
play it on PC and alpha stage and then

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.860
