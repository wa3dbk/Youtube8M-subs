00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.609 
okay guys I've rewired up the ignition
switch<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.640> my<00:00:05.759> Volkswagen<00:00:05.970> right<00:00:06.450> now<00:00:06.589> so<00:00:07.589> I

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:07.619 
switch on my Volkswagen right now so I

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:10.210 
switch on my Volkswagen right now so I
thought<00:00:07.950> I'd<00:00:08.069> take<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> video<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:08.880> you

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
thought I'd take a video to show you

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
thought I'd take a video to show you
basically<00:00:11.220> what<00:00:11.340> happened<00:00:11.820> was<00:00:11.850> up

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
basically what happened was up

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.980 
basically what happened was up
underneath<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.930> column<00:00:13.680> up<00:00:14.160> underneath<00:00:14.430> here

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
underneath the column up underneath here

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
underneath the column up underneath here
there's<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.139> cylinder<00:00:17.099> that<00:00:17.220> goes<00:00:17.339> all<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.519> way

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
there's a cylinder that goes all the way

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.089 
there's a cylinder that goes all the way
through<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.089> that<00:00:18.509> this<00:00:19.470> key<00:00:19.679> feeds<00:00:19.919> into

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
through that that this key feeds into

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.720 
through that that this key feeds into
one<00:00:20.339> side<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.759> the<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.880> side<00:00:21.329> is<00:00:21.599> the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
one side on the other side is the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
one side on the other side is the
ignition<00:00:23.730> switch<00:00:24.179> and<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.409> middle<00:00:25.710> in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
ignition switch and in the middle in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.029 
ignition switch and in the middle in
that<00:00:25.949> mechanism<00:00:26.819> there's<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:28.050> button

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that mechanism there's a little button

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
that mechanism there's a little button
thing<00:00:29.339> that<00:00:29.489> sticks<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> addition<00:00:30.569> switch

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
thing that sticks in the addition switch

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
thing that sticks in the addition switch
well<00:00:30.989> that<00:00:31.079> thing<00:00:31.230> broke<00:00:31.499> off<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.760> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
well that thing broke off so I have to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
well that thing broke off so I have to
replace<00:00:33.060> the<00:00:33.270> entire<00:00:33.360> housing<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.380> houses

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
replace the entire housing that houses

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.640 
replace the entire housing that houses
all<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.250> stuff<00:00:35.490> which<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.290> pain<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
all this stuff which is a pain and so

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.010 
all this stuff which is a pain and so
rather<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> chose<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.120> reroute<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
rather than that I chose to reroute the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740 
rather than that I chose to reroute the
ignition<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.890> Volkswagen<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> still<00:00:42.600> need

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
ignition on my Volkswagen you still need

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
ignition on my Volkswagen you still need
the<00:00:42.840> key<00:00:42.990> in<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.380> of<00:00:43.560> right<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.220> might<00:00:45.000> do

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the key in it as of right now I might do

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
the key in it as of right now I might do
something<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.630> later<00:00:45.990> because<00:00:46.560> this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
something about that later because this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.120 
something about that later because this
thing<00:00:47.790> has<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.150> RFID<00:00:48.600> reader<00:00:48.860> this<00:00:49.860> little

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
thing has an RFID reader this little

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.950 
thing has an RFID reader this little
ring<00:00:50.310> right<00:00:50.490> here<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> there's<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.300> RFID<00:00:51.690> tag

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
ring right here and there's an RFID tag

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.550 
ring right here and there's an RFID tag
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> tee<00:00:52.650> so<00:00:53.720> there<00:00:54.720> is<00:00:54.840> another<00:00:55.080> security

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
in the tee so there is another security

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.230 
in the tee so there is another security
mechanism<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> also<00:00:56.400> it<00:00:56.490> unlocks<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.910> steering

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
mechanism and also it unlocks a steering

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.930 
mechanism and also it unlocks a steering
wheel<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.920> symptoms<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.610> mine<00:00:59.760> were

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
wheel but the symptoms on mine were

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
wheel but the symptoms on mine were
wouldn't<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.360> turn<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.720> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> ignition<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
wouldn't you turn it to the ignition it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.800 
wouldn't you turn it to the ignition it
does<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.400> push<00:01:02.640> itself<00:01:02.970> back<00:01:03.300> there's<00:01:03.660> no

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
does not push itself back there's no

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.690 
does not push itself back there's no
spring<00:01:04.140> loaded<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.010> goes<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> way

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
spring loaded here it goes all the way

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.790 
spring loaded here it goes all the way
doesn't<00:01:06.240> come<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.590> ought<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
doesn't come back and so it ought to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.140 
doesn't come back and so it ought to
come<00:01:07.950> back<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> position<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
come back to a position about like that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.540 
come back to a position about like that
and<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.630> doesn't<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.650> still<00:01:11.040> need<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.250> key<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
and it doesn't so still need the key in

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.899 
and it doesn't so still need the key in
however<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> ignition<00:01:13.340> ignored<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.730> lack

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
however all the ignition ignored my lack

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.790 
however all the ignition ignored my lack
of<00:01:14.940> radio<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.320> myself<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.680> new

of radio I'm going to get myself a new
radio<00:01:17.870> ignition<00:01:18.870> is<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.110> underneath<00:01:19.380> here

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
radio ignition is up underneath here

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.469
