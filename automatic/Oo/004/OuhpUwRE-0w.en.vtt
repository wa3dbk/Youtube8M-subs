mode when you push the button on his

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.190 
mode when you push the button on his

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
back here this causes his torso to swing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.370 
back here this causes his torso to swing
around<00:01:51.730> like<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:55.000> if<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.210> pose<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.900> arms

around like so and if you pose the arms

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.560 
around like so and if you pose the arms
with<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.460> gun<00:01:58.700> in<00:01:58.909> his<00:01:59.060> hand

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
with the gun in his hand

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.649 
with the gun in his hand
it's<00:02:00.010> like<00:02:01.010> he's<00:02:01.310> ramming<00:02:01.700> someone<00:02:02.300> with<00:02:02.480> his

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
it's like he's ramming someone with his

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.650 
it's like he's ramming someone with his
own<00:02:02.810> weapon

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800 

when<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.810> finished<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:13.180> get<00:02:13.360> his<00:02:13.510> tosser

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
when you finished you get his tosser

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.630 
when you finished you get his tosser
into<00:02:14.170> place<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.980> pull<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.340> button

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
into place and then you pull the button

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.510 
into place and then you pull the button
out<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:18.490> locks<00:02:18.670> into<00:02:18.970> place

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
out and it locks into place

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.670 
out and it locks into place
admittedly<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:22.360> gimmick<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.960> weird<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.470> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
admittedly this gimmick is weird for a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.970 
admittedly this gimmick is weird for a
prime<00:02:24.040> figure<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> works<00:02:26.800> okay<00:02:27.310> at<00:02:27.490> least

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
prime figure but it works okay at least

prime figure but it works okay at least
the<00:02:29.980> clicking<00:02:30.400> sounds<00:02:30.850> may<00:02:31.030> put<00:02:31.330> some<00:02:31.570> off

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
the clicking sounds may put some off

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.290 
the clicking sounds may put some off
though<00:02:31.990> since<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.650> does<00:02:32.950> sound<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:34.030> toy

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
though since it does sound like the toy

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.730 
though since it does sound like the toy
is<00:02:34.540> broken<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.450> transformation<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.560> the
