00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.559
 to make an adeco in case for a case 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.170
 for a cell phone carrier this can be 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.839
 any cell ok it is not necessary that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.890
 look at the design or nothing just the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.590
 thing is to do some design for 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 a cell phone ok ok let's start 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 quickly 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.619
 I already previously pasted a tape the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 tape that you want be it for 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 any color you want in this case and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 I grabbed these tapes that is this color 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.899
 that has a little web shine 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 You can choose the ones you want 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'm going to use some balls 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.820
 use decorations that are here already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 previously made lists I also made 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 this rose and these to decorations that are 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.850
 chocolates milk kits with strawberry and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 the cut in half because they are going to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.520
 sink with the silicone ok let's start I'll 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 to also use glitter this and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.050
 I will also use where is this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.540
 these shining stickies 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.790
 they are plastic they can throw any 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
 good thing I will also use a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 silicone that is completely simple 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.990
 100% silicone is silicone for bathrooms 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 some have asked me what silicone 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.760
 I use or I do not know what's there 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.290
 curious about this silicone that can 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 found in any shop 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.440
 hardware store we start quickly 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.650
 we stop high around our 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.890
 mobile 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.030
 it comes like this I'm going to throw a more amount 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 or less moderate 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.450
 things like that and good is what I'm going to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 do not do much what I 'm going to throw 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 but they have to be reasonable 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.360
 we quickly grab with the help of 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 here on the sides 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.900
 let's grab and let's throw 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 spread it on all sides this does not 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.260
 have 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.020
 system of nothing or in the sense of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.870
 they can make any arrangement this does not 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.600
 I have a baker's mouthpiece or anything 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 it's something homemade that we 're going to do it and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.480
 you can practice it in the house 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.330
 okay 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.250
 look how I'm going around and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.310
 right now before it is not the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.989
 silicone quickly this I will be 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.530
 doing a little bit down so that 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.960
 I grip the tape me how transparent 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.370
 who has this 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.100
 this this case 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.050
 well well let's do it 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.530
 they do it with a stick if you are 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.530
 have I in this case grabbed a useful 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.490
 well I've done well 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.480
 this is thrown away because the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.480
 expert witnesses 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.840
 how is it called good quickly I'll 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.940
 take a little glitter this and what 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.310
 I'm going to spread like this 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.890
 as if they were throwing their 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.940
 pancake so that our glitter and then 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.280
 focus faster 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.640
 well quickly from here I'm going to put 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.310
 this here already having this first you 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.100
 I put the glider because if it is not it will not 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.730
 paste there between our design this 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.819
 rosita here I'm going to paste here there goes 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.069
 to be 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.889
 If you need silicone end you will 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.519
 throw the sides ok good 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.629
 quickly like this is a little dirty 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.389
 you have to have paper in your hand 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.230
 ok napkins I will quickly put 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.959
 I'm going to put this to melody I'll put it 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.599
 to this end I hope you like this 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.870
 I'm not even going to design 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.530
 put to an extreme I think it would fall better 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 here ok then what we grabbed here 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.819
 it would quickly be this cupcake that would be 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.239
 good in this place here 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.669
 here ok I'll put in the order that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.900
 you want this beautiful poop mazzea 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.389
 with colors 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.210
 I'm going to put you on this extreme 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.340
 ok always pressing for our 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.560
 design after we were integrated into the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.740
 silicone and we stick these chocolates 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.270
 I'm going to put it on this end here 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.010
 giving our chocolate decoration 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.730
 And here I also have some pallets 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.610
 little ones too that would fall well here 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.540
 well pressed here we are going to put another 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.840
 palette 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.430
 ok I also have these roses that I made 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.810
 white with one euro so that the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.810
 color and I'm going to put it here 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.710
 here I have another I'm going to put this 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.200
 extreme 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.770
 have to put it in several places 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.570
 milestones to plug the gaps and I made 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.670
 also these sticks here that I 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.670
 They look great and I'm going to put them here 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.880
 look how cute this design looks 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.650
 something very simple and all the 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.210
 materials only is with the clay 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.580
 Polymer paul and clay 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.380
 ok polymer clay I also made some 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.610
 balls that you can make and 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.949
 if you realize 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.650
 I did not put these balls but still 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.960
 I'm going to put them here to give light to 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.840
 design 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.630
 in a neutral place nothing but the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.420
 I'm going to put this transparent color 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.550
 shinny ok 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.040
 they are places that are going to be there 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.910
 so that only from light to design nothing 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.350
 plus 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:00.400
 and here I think that there should be one not going 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.400
 to cover the design 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.230
 here it can be 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.599
 moving a little bit and there 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.299
 look how you can see it is already 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.809
 ready without many many 

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:20.419
 arrangements if you need here in this area 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.380
 because you already accommodate it with a little 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.720
 more than silicone 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.240
 and so we see ourselves in our design and 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.820
 our finish in this area here 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.450
 I'm going to put another stick for what 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.449
 stand out with the help of a clamp for 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.960
 that looks 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.860
 something that is there and quickly I'm going to 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.080
 place I think it's good 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.080
 girls and guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.389

 he took it carefully with care and 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.949
 Look how you see us, it's nice, it's not 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.409
 I needed to throw these 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:01.500
 pieces of paper because you already have a leader there and 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.500
 If I want I have done more to stick 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:10.439
 and so he let it dry and look they have their 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.770
 beige color for the cellphone ok 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.229
