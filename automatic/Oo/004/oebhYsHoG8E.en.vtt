it's<00:02:06.780> quite<00:02:06.990> cold<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> lacks<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:07.920> air<00:02:08.190> oh<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's quite cold and lacks any air oh so

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's quite cold and lacks any air oh so
you<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.509> empty<00:02:09.989> headed
