what's<00:01:42.420> happening<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.719> your<00:01:42.780> body<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
what's happening in your body right so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.029 
what's happening in your body right so
this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.469> what<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> do

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
this is what I do

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.069 
this is what I do
least<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> reason<00:01:45.000> why<00:01:45.090> first<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
least the reason why first of all I'm

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.359 
least the reason why first of all I'm
Sonia<00:01:46.289> burn<00:01:46.439> fat<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.070> wanted<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
Sonia burn fat I know that I wanted to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
Sonia burn fat I know that I wanted to
chop<00:01:47.990> hormones<00:01:48.990> burn<00:01:49.200> fat<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.439> growth<00:01:49.649> hormone

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
chop hormones burn fat is growth hormone

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
chop hormones burn fat is growth hormone
so<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.250> went<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.640> Google<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:50.969> I<00:01:51.090> looked<00:01:51.299> up

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so I went on Google and I looked up

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
so I went on Google and I looked up
everything<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.469> is<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.679> know<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.829> growth

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
everything there is to know about growth

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.620 
everything there is to know about growth
hormone<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.700> natural<00:01:54.090> growth<00:01:54.240> obviously

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
hormone right natural growth obviously

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.779 
hormone right natural growth obviously
and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.500> realized<00:01:55.829> obviously<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
and I realized obviously you know if you

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.279 
and I realized obviously you know if you
don't<00:01:56.939> eat<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.179> long<00:01:57.359> period<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
don't eat for long period of time or you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.739 
don't eat for long period of time or you
do<00:01:59.249> on<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> high<00:01:59.579> intensity<00:01:59.850> exercise<00:02:00.479> before

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
do on a high intensity exercise before

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.260 
do on a high intensity exercise before
one<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.020> released<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.429> manipulate<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
one is released so I manipulate that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
one is released so I manipulate that
right<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.929> also<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> insulin<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
right I also know that insulin is a you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.609 
right I also know that insulin is a you
know<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.450> fat<00:02:06.780> storing<00:02:07.229> hormone

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
know you know as a fat storing hormone

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
know you know as a fat storing hormone
so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.250> said<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> solution<00:02:09.360> wife<00:02:09.599> dies

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so I said that the solution wife dies

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
so I said that the solution wife dies
like<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> minute<00:02:10.440> fasting<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.099> called

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
like in a minute fasting and called

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.530 
like in a minute fasting and called
backloading<00:02:11.550> works<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.030> well<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.480> because

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
backloading works so well is because

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.289 
backloading works so well is because
limit<00:02:14.079> insulins<00:02:14.620> effects<00:02:15.219> like<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> short

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
limit insulins effects like a short

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.360 
limit insulins effects like a short
period<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.659> time<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:17.590> maximize<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
period of time and then maximize the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.740 
period of time and then maximize the
amount<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.640> time<00:02:18.819> performance<00:02:19.329> stays<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.659> your

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
amount of time performance stays in your

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.789 
amount of time performance stays in your
body<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.810> simple<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.290> example<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
body to be simple for example if you

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.619 
body to be simple for example if you
don't<00:02:23.950> eat<00:02:24.099> for<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> long<00:02:24.459> time<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.180> know<00:02:25.299> you

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
don't eat for a long time you know you

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.089 
don't eat for a long time you know you
wake<00:02:25.780> up<00:02:25.959> everybody<00:02:26.379> knows<00:02:26.560> studies<00:02:26.980> have

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
wake up everybody knows studies have

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.440 
wake up everybody knows studies have
shown<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.340> when<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:27.939> sleep<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.269> growth

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
shown you when you sleep in growth

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.360 
shown you when you sleep in growth
hormone<00:02:28.689> is<00:02:28.780> running<00:02:28.989> wild<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.409> studies<00:02:30.280> have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
hormone is running wild and studies have

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.490 
hormone is running wild and studies have
also<00:02:30.489> shown<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.790> when<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.970> wake<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:32.019> goes

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
also shown and when you wake up it goes

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.899 
also shown and when you wake up it goes
down<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.370> don't<00:02:33.519> eat<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.819> next

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
down and if you don't eat for the next

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.849 
down and if you don't eat for the next
two<00:02:34.150> hours<00:02:34.209> or<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.049> goes<00:02:35.230> back<00:02:35.439> up<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> lot

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
two hours or so it goes back up a lot

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.839 
two hours or so it goes back up a lot
people<00:02:36.010> don't<00:02:36.220> know<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.340> that's<00:02:36.609> why<00:02:36.819> I

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
people don't know that that's why I

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.099 
people don't know that that's why I
skipped<00:02:37.209> breakfast<00:02:37.629> in<00:02:37.750> carb<00:02:37.959> backloading

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
skipped breakfast in carb backloading

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.660 
skipped breakfast in carb backloading
that's<00:02:38.470> why<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> skip<00:02:38.950> breakfast<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.459> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
that's why you skip breakfast in a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190 
that's why you skip breakfast in a
minute<00:02:39.909> fasting<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.689> that's<00:02:40.810> why<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:40.989> works

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
minute fasting and that's why it works

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.929 
minute fasting and that's why it works
so<00:02:41.260> well<00:02:41.349> because<00:02:41.500> growth<00:02:42.370> hormone<00:02:42.790> is

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
so well because growth hormone is

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.550 
so well because growth hormone is
running<00:02:43.329> wild<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.659> your<00:02:43.780> body<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.409> not

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
running wild in your body it's not

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.259 
running wild in your body it's not
interrupted<00:02:45.099> by<00:02:45.219> insulin<00:02:45.639> and<00:02:45.849> it's<00:02:46.000> doing

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
interrupted by insulin and it's doing

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.699 
interrupted by insulin and it's doing
what<00:02:46.420> growth<00:02:46.569> hormone<00:02:46.900> does<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.349> building

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
what growth hormone does it's building

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.830 
what growth hormone does it's building
it's<00:02:47.889> burning<00:02:48.250> fat<00:02:48.659> chicken<00:02:49.659> on<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.780> stove

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it's burning fat chicken on the stove

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.809 
it's burning fat chicken on the stove
and<00:02:50.139> it's<00:02:50.319> promoting<00:02:50.769> muscle<00:02:51.069> growth<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.730> I'm

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
and it's promoting muscle growth so I'm

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.460 
and it's promoting muscle growth so I'm
always<00:02:52.120> conscious<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.200> right<00:02:53.319> now

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
always conscious of that like right now

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.589 
always conscious of that like right now
I<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.650> went<00:02:53.919> from<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.129> gym<00:02:54.599> post-workout

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
I just went from the gym post-workout

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.909 
I just went from the gym post-workout
pantry<00:02:56.109> I'm<00:02:56.230> eating<00:02:56.439> carbs<00:02:56.709> like<00:02:56.829> a

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
pantry I'm eating carbs like a

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.409 
pantry I'm eating carbs like a
motherfucker<00:02:57.370> saw<00:02:57.519> know<00:02:57.579> what's<00:02:57.819> happening

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
motherfucker saw know what's happening

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.720 
motherfucker saw know what's happening
insulin<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.319> in<00:02:59.470> my<00:02:59.560> body<00:02:59.739> so<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.010> already<00:03:00.519> know

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
insulin is in my body so I already know

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.979 
insulin is in my body so I already know
but<00:03:00.879> when<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.000> was<00:03:01.180> training<00:03:01.359> I<00:03:01.659> knew<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.900> was

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
but when I was training I knew it was

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.599 
but when I was training I knew it was
growth<00:03:02.200> hormone<00:03:02.470> testosterone<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.549> I'm

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
growth hormone testosterone so I'm

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.610 
growth hormone testosterone so I'm
pretty<00:03:03.819> much<00:03:03.939> able<00:03:04.359> to<00:03:04.450> tell<00:03:04.659> am<00:03:05.200> i<00:03:05.379> building

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.760 
to do that is after the gym because
that's<00:04:32.690> when<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.870> want<00:04:33.140> insulin<00:04:33.500> that's<00:04:33.650> when

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
that's when you want insulin that's when

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.950 
that's when you want insulin that's when
you<00:04:33.890> want<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.850> know<00:04:34.970> despite<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.720> setup

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
you want to you know despite the setup

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.030 
you want to you know despite the setup
so<00:04:36.050> just<00:04:36.200> think<00:04:36.380> about<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.740> when<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:36.920> saw

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
so just think about that when you saw

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.100 
so just think about that when you saw
the<00:04:37.100> birth<00:04:37.340> fat<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.790> always<00:04:38.180> think<00:04:38.450> what

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the birth fat I always think what

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.140 
the birth fat I always think what
hormone<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.620> wild<00:04:40.220> in<00:04:40.310> my<00:04:40.340> body<00:04:40.610> but<00:04:40.760> obviously

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
hormone is wild in my body but obviously

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.670

the ogor in your body at any given time
but<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:42.980> think<00:04:43.190> which<00:04:43.370> one<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.610> being<00:04:43.790> done

eating before going to war was a very
very<00:06:51.670> big<00:06:52.450> mistake<00:06:52.480> because<00:06:53.080> they<00:06:53.200> knew<00:06:53.290> that

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
very big mistake because they knew that

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.440 
very big mistake because they knew that
when<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.950> soldiers<00:06:54.310> would<00:06:54.460> eat<00:06:54.640> and<00:06:54.850> be<00:06:54.940> full

when the soldiers would eat and be full
and<00:06:55.750> we<00:06:56.200> get<00:06:56.350> attacked<00:06:56.710> by<00:06:57.040> like<00:06:57.190> a<00:06:57.220> preemptive

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
and we get attacked by like a preemptive

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.100 
and we get attacked by like a preemptive
strike<00:06:57.730> that<00:06:58.060> it<00:06:58.120> will<00:06:58.210> go<00:06:58.300> to<00:06:58.360> war<00:06:58.540> they<00:06:59.050> were

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
strike that it will go to war they were

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.780 
strike that it will go to war they were
tired<00:06:59.500> or<00:06:59.740> lethargic<00:07:00.310> and<00:07:00.490> things<00:07:00.640> like<00:07:00.730> that

tired or lethargic and things like that

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.000 
tired or lethargic and things like that
so<00:07:00.940> most<00:07:01.240> armies<00:07:01.660> that<00:07:01.810> would<00:07:01.960> eat<00:07:02.230> it<00:07:02.680> was

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
so most armies that would eat it was

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.720 
so most armies that would eat it was
called<00:07:03.220> back<00:07:03.340> load

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730
