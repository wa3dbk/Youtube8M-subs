take I don't really know how much the
changes<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.460> difference<00:01:35.850> probably<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.869> at

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
changes the difference probably not at

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.910 
changes the difference probably not at
all<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.710> has<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.540> has<00:01:39.659> a
