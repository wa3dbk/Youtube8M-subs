00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 North America covers 16 percent of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.820
 the land mass of the earth more than 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.820
 Europe and the Middle East together 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.869
 in it is the national park of 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.240
 yellowstone the grand canyon the monte sun 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.220
 Helens and the largest group of water lakes 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.220
 sweet of the world the great lakes 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.570
 these are the apalaches the mountain range 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.960
 oldest that exists in the continent 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.340
 today they measure almost 4,000 kilometers and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.829
 they go from Newfoundland to Alabama 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.949
 do not 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.489
 but when they emerged 270 million years ago 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.399
 of years 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 North America did not exist yet 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.789
 mountains crowned a supercontinent 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 called pangea 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.080
 these folded rock strips are the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.059
 testimony of the three collisions 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.059
 British that created the mountains 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.010
 thousands of millions of years after the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.390
 creation of tonality of up to two 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.370
 old continents collide as 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.010
 that these two continents are approaching 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.480
 the ocean floor is pushed under what 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.480
 that one day it will be Africa 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.710
 gradually the ocean is reduced and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 huge sections of ocean floor are 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.880
 they see pressed against the continent 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.880
 creating valleys and cliffs 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 the continent continues its inexorable 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.300
 trip compressing between both the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.450
 possible islands that would have 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.840
 the waste accumulates now on land 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 firm 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.179
 the continental collision pushes them towards 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.450
 up increasing the height of the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.450
 Appalachians 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.390
 ah 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.870
 is the geological equivalent of a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.870
 car accident or in the cut of the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.209
 highway we find the lifting 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 treating the rocks of each one can be 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.709
 calculate when they occurred 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.610
 the construction of the apalaches led 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.740
 almost 200 million years the movement 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.959
 of these masses is usually about 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.510
 centimeters a year is very slow more or 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 minus the speed at which they grow us 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.959
 the ones 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.860
 this mountain building process 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.410
 it requires hundreds of thousands of kilometers 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.450
 Cubic rock is believed to originate 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.320
 the Appalachians outnumbered the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 current himalayas 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.170
 but they are no longer what they were another powerful 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.739
 ecological phenomenon has shrunk the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.739
 erosion 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.360
 the powerful Appalachians looked 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.670
 affected by a strong enemy the water 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.220
 when the water freezes its volume 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.560
 increases up to 8% 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.700
 the water that freezes in its cracks 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.700
 break them 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.020
 when the temperature goes up the ice will 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.210
 melts and takes the waste 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.980
 the wind and rain add to the 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.900
 process and with the passage of time 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.900
 they end up transforming the landscape 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.410
 Erosion can cause some damage 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.030
 incredible to the mountains and this what 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.610
 we see in Appalachia the Appalachians 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.930
 modern are just the shadow of a 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.930
 huge and very high mountain range 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.080
 nowadays the eroded mountains of 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.080
 Pangea are in North America 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.350
 Pangea is big almost as much as all 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.350
 our continents together 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.040
 the temperature is increasing under the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.040
 continent and heats it 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.139
 as the rocks absorb heat it 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.949
 they arch 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.639
 and when they reach the weakest point they split 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.639
 including those of the Appalachians 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.420
 it is a process by which laughs are created 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.330
 come down to fracture creates long valleys 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.330
 and narrow 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.229
 of pressures that will be filled with 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.099
 sediments from the elevated 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.099
 neighboring areas 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.390
 one of these forms is the basin 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.690
 sedimentary of pennsylvania new york and 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.690
 New Jersey 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.140
 the already solidified sediment has 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.810
 extracted now we see it in the streets of 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.810
 new york on all reddish stones 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.440
 230 million years ago 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.420
 the rif between North America and Africa creates 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.670
 a new ocean the Atlantic 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.890
 as the two land masses are 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.700
 they separate the water filling the hole 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.700
 between them 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.949
 the North American continent is created 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.960
 nearly four billion years later 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.960
 that the first lands were formed 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.479
 its silhouette and characteristics are 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.369
 different from what we know now 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.390
 other geological processes were commissioned 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:58.820
 to change them 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.210
 america was built by tectonics of 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.440
 plates but it was outlined with fire the 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.440
 thread and water 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.900
 millions of years after the 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.610
 fragmentation of pangea a little sea 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.930
 deep crosses the inside of the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.930
 North American continent 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.620
 is the way to be inside if northern part 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.749
 america from the arctic ocean to the 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:35.509
 gulf of mexico is the hunting ground of 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:41.389
 fearsome reptiles the mosasaurs and the 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:43.639
 plesiosauros you think it 's amazing that 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.469
 there was a sea on the continent but 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.629
 North America is very big and its point 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:50.139
 higher is the mackinley that has some 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.139
 6000 meters 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.800
 in a place of 6,500 kilometers wide 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:01.070
 that the highest point has 6000 meters 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.420
 it means that it's flat as a table 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.690
 Of course it is on the sphere 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.430
 terrestrial so it leans a bit 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.009
 ocean rises if it does not move away from 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.909
 continent 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:16.669
 it's a rising phenomenon 70 ago 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:19.580
 millions of years a great force forces 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:22.399
 to empty the inner sea emptying 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.039
 so the continent the sea 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:27.860
 when leaving it leaves behind rich layers of 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:31.039
 sediments that will eventually be the 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.830
 great American plains a vast 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:37.749
 landscape that extends from mexico by 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.749
 texas montana and canada
