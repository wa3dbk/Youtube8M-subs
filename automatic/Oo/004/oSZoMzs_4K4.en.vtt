00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
actually really cool but I've had that
mirror<00:01:50.220> since<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.579> sixth<00:01:50.850> grade<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mirror since like sixth grade so I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.999 
mirror since like sixth grade so I
decided<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.020> time<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> upgrade<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> got<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
decided it was time to upgrade and got a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.719 
decided it was time to upgrade and got a
new<00:01:53.280> mirror<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:56.159> comes<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
new mirror and a it comes with like a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.340 
new mirror and a it comes with like a
little<00:01:56.939> pouch<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.170> put

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
little pouch thing which I could put

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
little pouch thing which I could put
like<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.670> chapstick<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.570> or

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
like I don't know chapstick in or

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.999 
like I don't know chapstick in or
something<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.530> comes<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.860> more

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
something and then it comes with more

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
something and then it comes with more
magnets<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.719> with

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
magnets would actually kind of go with

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
magnets would actually kind of go with
these<00:02:04.020> magnets<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> always

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
these magnets so you know that always

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.550 
these magnets so you know that always
works<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.759> even<00:02:06.090> though<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.719> locker<00:02:06.960> always

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
works out even though my locker always

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
works out even though my locker always
ends<00:02:07.829> up<00:02:07.920> looking<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.250> World<00:02:08.580> War<00:02:08.789> 3

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
ends up looking like World War 3

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.520 
ends up looking like World War 3
happened<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.720> there

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
happened in there

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.020 
happened in there
this<00:02:11.160> kid<00:02:11.370> Matt<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.970> last<00:02:12.239> year<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.780> had

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
this kid Matt and I last year we had

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.580 
this kid Matt and I last year we had
lockers<00:02:13.360> next<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.690> each<00:02:13.780> other<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.260> literally

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
lockers next to each other and literally

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.010 
lockers next to each other and literally
when<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.010> open<00:02:15.400> our<00:02:15.490> lockers<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.420> was<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
when we open our lockers it was like the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.870 
when we open our lockers it was like the
world<00:02:17.230> exploded<00:02:17.890> everything<00:02:18.340> there's<00:02:18.520> poured

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
world exploded everything there's poured

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.520 
world exploded everything there's poured
out<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.209> our<00:02:19.300> lockers<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:19.900> actually<00:02:20.290> quite

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
out of our lockers it's actually quite

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.430 
out of our lockers it's actually quite
funny<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.130> our<00:02:21.910> lockers<00:02:22.330> both<00:02:22.750> had<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.170> flu

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
funny and our lockers both had the flu

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.800 
funny and our lockers both had the flu
and<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:24.040> think<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.370> named<00:02:24.610> our<00:02:24.850> lockers<00:02:25.270> too<00:02:25.569> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and I think we named our lockers too and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.230 
and I think we named our lockers too and
at<00:02:26.380> Locker<00:02:26.590> clean-out<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.459> was<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.150> was

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.580 
be really stressful with me between
everything<00:02:36.910> that's<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:38.140> schools

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
everything that's going on in schools

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.500 
everything that's going on in schools
and<00:02:38.860> stuff<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> decide<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> get<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> planner

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and stuff so I decide to get a planner

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.449 
and stuff so I decide to get a planner
because<00:02:41.020> my<00:02:41.350> school<00:02:41.560> gives<00:02:41.800> me<00:02:41.980> planners<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
because my school gives me planners that

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.340 
because my school gives me planners that
those<00:02:42.700> aren't<00:02:43.000> cute<00:02:43.239> enough<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.900> end<00:02:44.170> up

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
those aren't cute enough so I end up

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.620 
those aren't cute enough so I end up
just<00:02:44.590> losing<00:02:45.010> them<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.280> they're<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.060> ugly

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
just losing them because they're so ugly

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150 
just losing them because they're so ugly
like<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.350> don't<00:02:47.440> want<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.739> carry<00:02:47.980> around

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
like I don't want to carry around

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.979 
like I don't want to carry around
something<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> globe<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.600> my<00:02:49.720> school

something with a globe and my school

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
something with a globe and my school
name<00:02:50.140> on<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> think<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> lot<00:02:51.370> cuter

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
name on it I think this is a lot cuter

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.580 
name on it I think this is a lot cuter
and<00:02:52.150> maybe<00:02:52.420> since<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.810> cute<00:02:53.110> I'll<00:02:53.320> remember

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
and maybe since it's cute I'll remember

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.920 
and maybe since it's cute I'll remember
to<00:02:53.890> take<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.100> places<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.180> then<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.480> picked<00:02:55.810> up

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to take it places and then I picked up

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.890 
to take it places and then I picked up
lots<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.530> notebooks<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:58.090> personally<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
lots of notebooks because personally I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.440 
lots of notebooks because personally I
don't<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.380> finders<00:03:00.069> my<00:03:00.610> math<00:03:00.790> teacher<00:03:01.150> last

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
don't like finders my math teacher last

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.600 
don't like finders my math teacher last
year<00:03:01.690> made<00:03:01.840> us<00:03:01.959> had<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> binder<00:03:02.590> made<00:03:03.190> us<00:03:03.370> have

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
year made us had a binder made us have

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.300 
year made us had a binder made us have
eyes<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.000> made<00:03:04.390> us<00:03:04.540> had<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> binder<00:03:05.230> made<00:03:05.800> us<00:03:05.980> have

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
eyes I made us had a binder made us have

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.729 
eyes I made us had a binder made us have
a<00:03:06.580> binder<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.600> was<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> reason<00:03:08.290> why<00:03:08.470> my

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
a binder and that was the reason why my

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.500 
a binder and that was the reason why my
locker<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.250> such<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> mess<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.940> think<00:03:10.180> because

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
locker was such a mess I think because

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.660 
locker was such a mess I think because
the<00:03:10.959> papers<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.709> don't<00:03:11.890> stick<00:03:12.190> things<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
the papers I don't stick things and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.360 
the papers I don't stick things and
folders<00:03:13.090> honestly<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.050> slide<00:03:14.470> them<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.860> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
folders honestly I just slide them in so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.949 
folders honestly I just slide them in so
things<00:03:15.610> would<00:03:15.730> fall<00:03:15.940> out<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.360> binder<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
things would fall out of the binder and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.750 
things would fall out of the binder and
it<00:03:17.079> was<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.350> too<00:03:17.500> much<00:03:17.650> work<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:18.100> personally

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
it was just too much work I personally

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.880 
it was just too much work I personally
like<00:03:18.970> notebooks<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.750> picked<00:03:20.200> up<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.440> black<00:03:20.680> one

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
like notebooks I picked up a black one

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.850

subjects<00:03:53.769> with<00:03:53.950> certain<00:03:54.220> colors<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:55.109> also

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
subjects with certain colors I also

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.229 
subjects with certain colors I also
picked<00:03:56.470> up<00:03:56.560> by<00:03:56.709> orange<00:03:57.100> notebook<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:57.820> in<00:03:58.030> all<00:03:58.209> I

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
picked up by orange notebook so in all I

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.410 
picked up by orange notebook so in all I
think<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.720> have<00:03:58.840> 7<00:03:59.320> notebooks<00:03:59.799> because<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.640> this

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
think I have 7 notebooks because I this

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.970 
think I have 7 notebooks because I this
year<00:04:01.660> like<00:04:01.840> last<00:04:01.900> year<00:04:02.350> we<00:04:02.440> only<00:04:02.530> had<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.799> take

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
year like last year we only had to take

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.530 
year like last year we only had to take
one<00:04:03.250> cycle<00:04:03.489> class<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.030> was<00:04:04.150> literally<00:04:04.450> like

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
one cycle class it was literally like

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.539 
one cycle class it was literally like
art<00:04:04.959> where<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.380> got<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.799> pottery<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:06.489> you

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
art where you got to do pottery so you

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.490 
art where you got to do pottery so you
didn't<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.970> take<00:04:07.120> notes<00:04:07.420> but<00:04:07.989> we're

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
didn't have to take notes but we're

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.890 
didn't have to take notes but we're
taking<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:09.030> financial<00:04:10.030> literacy<00:04:10.480> or

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
taking like financial literacy or

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.120 
taking like financial literacy or
something<00:04:11.230> like<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.680> don't<00:04:11.799> know<00:04:12.040> if

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
something like that so I don't know if

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.710 
something like that so I don't know if
you<00:04:12.220> need<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.459> take<00:04:12.609> notes<00:04:12.850> for<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.690> I

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
you need to take notes for that so I

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.240 
you need to take notes for that so I
decided<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.200> be<00:04:14.320> safer<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> notebook

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
decided to be safer and in a notebook

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.860 
decided to be safer and in a notebook
but<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.609> didn't<00:04:15.940> get<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.090> folder<00:04:16.600> for<00:04:16.720> that

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
but I didn't get a folder for that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.870 
but I didn't get a folder for that

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
my vision is pretty bad so eventually my

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.270 
my vision is pretty bad so eventually my
vision<00:06:20.870> got<00:06:20.990> too<00:06:21.169> bad<00:06:21.290> for<00:06:21.530> those<00:06:21.620> glasses<00:06:22.100> but

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
sat on them and they cracked like the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.800

they<00:06:27.980> became<00:06:28.340> crooked<00:06:28.790> so<00:06:29.240> that<00:06:29.390> just<00:06:29.600> really

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
they became crooked so that just really

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.810 
they became crooked so that just really
added<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.350> the<00:06:30.530> effect<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.220> the<00:06:31.340> neon<00:06:31.610> red

glasses with the crooked frames so I

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.640

time<00:06:36.979> to<00:06:37.160> pick

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480
