00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
I found them to last just as long as the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.830 
I found them to last just as long as the
Mac<00:03:47.349> ones<00:03:48.150> found<00:03:49.150> them<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.390> work<00:03:49.510> really<00:03:49.719> well

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
Mac ones found them to work really well

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.740 
Mac ones found them to work really well
blend<00:03:50.260> really<00:03:50.409> well<00:03:50.560> apply<00:03:51.069> really<00:03:51.310> well<00:03:51.750> and

blend really well apply really well and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.559 
blend really well apply really well and
these<00:03:53.530> are<00:03:53.590> point<00:03:54.189> one<00:03:54.519> four<00:03:54.730> ounces<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
these are point one four ounces and the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.319 
these are point one four ounces and the
Mac<00:03:55.720> ones<00:03:56.019> are<00:03:56.379> point<00:03:57.340> one<00:03:57.519> seven<00:03:57.700> ounces<00:03:58.150> so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
Mac ones are point one seven ounces so

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.660 
Mac ones are point one seven ounces so
you<00:03:58.359> do<00:03:58.720> get<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.530> little<00:03:59.769> bit<00:04:00.010> more<00:04:00.159> product

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
you do get a little bit more product

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.720 
you do get a little bit more product
with<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.909> Mac<00:04:01.060> Paint<00:04:01.329> Pots<00:04:01.540> but<00:04:02.409> I<00:04:02.889> still

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
with the Mac Paint Pots but I still

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.160 
with the Mac Paint Pots but I still
think<00:04:03.970> these<00:04:04.060> are<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.269> lot<00:04:04.480> more<00:04:04.510> worth<00:04:04.959> it

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
think these are a lot more worth it

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.069 
think these are a lot more worth it
because<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.620> price<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.400> ounce<00:04:07.209> ratio<00:04:07.719> is<00:04:08.049> a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
because the price to ounce ratio is a

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.229 
because the price to ounce ratio is a
lot<00:04:08.409> better<00:04:08.530> for<00:04:08.859> these<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.639> if<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.879> guys<00:04:09.970> ever
