00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
okay so we've got a jug ready with a
sieve<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.580> passed<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> mixture<00:01:21.299> oh

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sieve and we just passed the mixture oh

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.609 
sieve and we just passed the mixture oh
that's<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.900> remove<00:01:22.080> any<00:01:22.200> bits<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> egg

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
you've got a vanilla pod on the or some
spices<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:26.640> confusing<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.390> some

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
spices if you're confusing it with some

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.230 
spices if you're confusing it with some
spices<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.549> passing<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:32.240> jags

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
spices and just passing it through jags

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.520 
spices and just passing it through jags
good<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.689> makes<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.200> easier<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
good it just makes it a bit easier to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.569 
good it just makes it a bit easier to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you'll know sort of kind of rotate it a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.880 
you'll know sort of kind of rotate it a
little<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:53.299> just<00:02:54.299> helped<00:02:55.140> make<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.440> Karen

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
little bit just helped make that Karen

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.390 
little bit just helped make that Karen
will<00:02:55.980> run<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.250> over<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.610> top<00:02:56.880> nice<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.360> even

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
will run all over the top nice and even

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.490 
will run all over the top nice and even
if<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.790> don't<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> guest<00:03:00.959> torch<00:03:01.260> what

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
if you do don't have a guest torch what

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.839 
if you do don't have a guest torch what
should<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.680> guess<00:03:01.829> most<00:03:02.069> people<00:03:02.190> at<00:03:02.519> home<00:03:02.640> don't

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
should I guess most people at home don't

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.670 
should I guess most people at home don't
what<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.569> can<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.930> turn<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.349> grill

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
what you can do is turn on the grill

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.699 
what you can do is turn on the grill
underneath<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.549> oven<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.000> use<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> it's

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
underneath your oven and use that it's

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
underneath your oven and use that it's
not<00:03:07.889> quite<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.579> good<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.970> gas<00:03:09.150> torch<00:03:09.450> but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
not quite as good as the gas torch but

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.220 
not quite as good as the gas torch but
does<00:03:10.019> work<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> old<00:03:12.810> days<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.200> used

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
does work and and the old days we used

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.809 
does work and and the old days we used
to<00:03:13.380> use<00:03:13.500> brown<00:03:13.829> sugar<00:03:13.859> Demerara<00:03:14.760> sugar

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
to use brown sugar Demerara sugar

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.120 
to use brown sugar Demerara sugar
instead<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.269> castor<00:03:15.690> sugar<00:03:15.720> sort<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.650> color<00:03:16.950> up

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
instead of castor sugar sort of color up

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.009 
instead of castor sugar sort of color up
a<00:03:17.160> little<00:03:17.459> bit<00:03:17.549> quicker<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.870> keep

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
a little bit quicker and and you keep

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.819 
a little bit quicker and and you keep
quite<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> good<00:03:19.470> result<00:03:19.829> as<00:03:20.010> well<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
quite a good result as well so just

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.539 
quite a good result as well so just
pointing<00:03:22.829> at<00:03:22.920> leader<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.160> students<00:03:23.459> be

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
pointing at leader of students be

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.620 
pointing at leader of students be
careful<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.880> sugar<00:03:24.090> doesn't<00:03:24.269> run<00:03:24.450> down<00:03:24.600> your

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
careful it sugar doesn't run down your

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.090 
careful it sugar doesn't run down your
arms<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.829> does<00:03:26.040> happen<00:03:27.260> there<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.380> go<00:03:28.500> minister

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
arms it does happen there we go minister

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.300 
arms it does happen there we go minister
probably<00:03:29.819> wait<00:03:30.359> for<00:03:31.200> about<00:03:31.380> two<00:03:31.769> minutes<00:03:31.950> or

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
probably wait for about two minutes or

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.890 
probably wait for about two minutes or
three<00:03:32.489> minutes<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.150> Karen<00:03:33.450> or<00:03:33.599> just<00:03:33.780> to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
three minutes for that Karen or just to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
three minutes for that Karen or just to
see<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.139> up<00:03:34.230> before<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.680> actually<00:03:34.859> um<00:03:35.370> break

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
see it up before we actually um break

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.470 
see it up before we actually um break
into<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.780> serve<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> just<00:03:39.150> repeating

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
into it and serve it so just repeating

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120 
into it and serve it so just repeating
the<00:03:39.540> process<00:03:39.690> again<00:03:40.019> oh<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.470> wipe<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> rum

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the process again oh so I wipe the rum

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.800 
the process again oh so I wipe the rum
each<00:03:41.250> time<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.819> know<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> sugar<00:03:42.420> sticks<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
each time so it know the sugar sticks to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.599 
each time so it know the sugar sticks to
the<00:03:42.900> room<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.170> caramelize<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.459> get<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
the room and caramelize you just get a

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.759 
the room and caramelize you just get a
bit<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.910> clean<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.269> result<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.769> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
bit of a clean and result there and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.220 
bit of a clean and result there and
again<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.220> using<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.609> torch<00:03:48.230> caramelizing

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
again just using that torch caramelizing

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.129 
again just using that torch caramelizing
it<00:03:49.319> giving<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.829> rotate<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.359> sugar<00:03:51.660> runs

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
it giving it a rotate so the sugar runs

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.090 
it giving it a rotate so the sugar runs
all<00:03:52.380> over<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:53.489> it's<00:03:53.639> nice<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:53.910> even

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
all over so it's nice and even

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.340 
all over so it's nice and even
we<00:03:56.190> go<00:03:56.460> it's<00:03:57.300> important<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.780> get<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
we go it's important that you get the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.040 
we go it's important that you get the
sugar<00:03:58.470> reasonably<00:03:59.130> dark<00:03:59.480> just<00:04:00.480> sort<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.720> helps

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
sugar reasonably dark just sort of helps

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.960 
sugar reasonably dark just sort of helps
offset<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.650> richness<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.370> care<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
offset the richness of the care of the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.060 
offset the richness of the care of the
actual<00:04:03.150> custard<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.500> sort<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.710> it's<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
actual custard so it's a sort of it's a

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.980 
actual custard so it's a sort of it's a

real simple dessert just a custard

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.510 
real simple dessert just a custard

really in there and a caramel top but

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.430 
really in there and a caramel top but
it's<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> combination<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> textures<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
it's the combination of the textures and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.590 
it's the combination of the textures and
the<00:04:10.670> bitterness<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.970> sweat<00:04:12.210> sweet
