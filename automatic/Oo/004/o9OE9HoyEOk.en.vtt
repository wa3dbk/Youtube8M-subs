00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello how are my name is Pedro and the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.660
 truth is that I'm very happy to be 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 here with you I hope that you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.379
 they are also very well and well 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.910
 although it is already February many of us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 we continue with our goal of being 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 healthy in this new year and it's for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.250
 that today I'm going to show you how it is that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 you can prepare some super crepes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 healthy without absolutely anything 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740
 flour the best of the case is that also 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 they are super cheap and that most 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 You can have the ingredients in your 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 house so I better invite you to you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 stay here and keep watching the video 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 We're going to need a cup of oatmeal 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.030
 cinnamon powder a cup of milk two 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.769
 eggs a teaspoon of vanilla 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.839
 sweetener without calories a cup of 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.609
 Greek yogurt without sugar the fruit that you 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.589
 you want and also the toppings that you 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.269
 you want let's start adding 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.760
 our oatmeal to the blender and we 're going 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.260
 to crush at a very low speed of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 You like me get to hit a little on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 the edges simply pass a covered 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.749
 of plastic so that it integrates super 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 well we passed it to a container and we 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.739
 we make sure that the glass is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.479
 totally clean because then they are left 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 then with the clean glass we add the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.740
 eggs milk cinnamon sweetener 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.530
 no calories the pod 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.020
 and again the crushed oats 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.100
 we crush it super well and we return it to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100
 move to a container 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.450
 for stuffing you can use things 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 that you want in the end I decided to use 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 a little dried cranberries no 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.670
 explained and I also added a 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.770
 calorie-free sweetener sachet 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.830
 because the yogurt has no sugar and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.840
 Again a little touch of cinnamon stirred him 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.880
 super good until everything was very 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.430
 well integrated and there has to be a 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.119
 pretty thick texture and something like 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.119
 the one with an ice cream 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.210
 I also decided to chop all my fruit and you 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.280
 you can do it any way you want 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 be sliced â€‹â€‹into cubes as you wish 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 and once we have all this already 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.150
 chopped we also reserve it we are going to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.580
 place in our stove at low heat 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.709
 a pan preferably flat and we're going to 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.600
 take our mix and here how are you 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.459
 thick just take a splash of 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.190
 milk and ponce what this is going to do that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.260
 new that super light afterwards with a 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.910
 cup a ladle what you have come on 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.130
 to take a measure of our mix and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.720
 we are going to incorporate it into our pan and 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.610
 we're going to turn this one over until 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.020
 the surface is completely covered 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.850
 by the mass 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.100
 and let's let it cost around 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.660
 about two minutes on each side 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.980
 the truth is they will visit a little more 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.980
 than the conventional crepes 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.409
 The good thing about these crepes is that they do not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.390
 You need to take off the ones on the banks 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.310
 alone he does it and when you see that this 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.930
 just happen to flip it over and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.930
 wait another 2 minutes 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.220
 then we can move them to a plate and 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.900
 cover with a cloth napkin to 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.549
 that they stay warm and not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.230
 there is a need to warm them up again 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.480
 already to place is super easy 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.129
 just take your cream and in the middle 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.360
 from her we are going to put a spoonful of 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.850
 our greek yogurt 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.680
 and we're going to spread it super well after 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.590
 let's take our prey or the fruit 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 that you have chosen and we already closed it 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.000
 also obviously you can decorate it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.130
 whatever you want, I decided to add a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.830
 trickle of honey and also return to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.830
 put a little nut and other dams 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.719
 and the truth is that yes they are super 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.370
 rich and you can eat it at any time 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.049
 of the day and of course that also 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.969
 you can accompany with the drink that you 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.560
 you want the truth is that connect cold and 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.659
 so much to accompany your crepes with a 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.239
 coffee is super hot and what better than 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.129
 doing it in a healthy way the truth is 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.689
 that yes it is very very easy to do if you 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.219
