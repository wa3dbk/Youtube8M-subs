it's<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.090> my<00:03:23.180> language<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.690> talk<00:03:23.930> about<00:03:24.079> it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the point of your question though was to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.199 
the point of your question though was to
ask<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.770> us<00:03:49.890> specifically<00:03:50.400> how<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.730> would

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
confidence so you were confident and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.449 
confidence so you were confident and
then<00:04:00.080> for<00:04:01.080> whatever<00:04:01.319> reason<00:04:01.560> or<00:04:02.160> for<00:04:02.190> whatever

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
then for whatever reason or for whatever

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.430 
then for whatever reason or for whatever
situation<00:04:03.360> something<00:04:03.810> something<00:04:04.050> jarred

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
