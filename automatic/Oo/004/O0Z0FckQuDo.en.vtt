00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.070
 and 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:20.860
 and it is precisely in these crafton zoos 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.310
 meet for a new video 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.810
 so my third 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.220
 so I'm very proud of my helmet 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.850
 frankly well well over 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.430
 ventilation and that so we end up 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.300
 for a new fire launcher video 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.100
 fireworks it starts to annoy me because 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.740
 it's the third time that I 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.280
 begins this video is always 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.350
 things that annoy me I am very 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:57.400
 manic so good we'll start already 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.260
 so you put waivers hours 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.059
 in the form that you want but 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 frankly it changes nothing here no 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.250
 like that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 then you put repeaters 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 behind that's it 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.830
 then you put there too it's a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 a little bit long then you connect 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:44.229
 up so not there connect it here hop hop hop 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:51.870
 not without nothing and everything is so 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.870
 here and then here is so here hop 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.810
 not here and it's no use that to pay for 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.030
 their red stone for nothing then you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.140
 go do a timer so here is very 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 simple pop up you put the repeaters 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:18.380
 like that or put the torch Redstone 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.070
 that's how it goes after 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.150
 you put a sticky piston here you 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.930
 do not put a block 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.470
 then you put and I forgot a 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 thing 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:40.489
 hop I take it 8 does a lever a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.050
 lever by a button because otherwise 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.209
 you can not control it it will do 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.310
 just a bit of a signal so here is so 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.400
 It's finish 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.760
