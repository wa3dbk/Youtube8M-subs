00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.019 

and<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.670> four-wheeler<00:00:27.250> is<00:00:28.250> actually<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.789> bass

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029

bus<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:30.320> we're<00:00:30.439> trying<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.860> have<00:00:30.920> different

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
bus but we're trying to have different

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.400 
bus but we're trying to have different
stuff<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:31.669> like<00:00:31.849> and<00:00:32.239> with<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.230> gate

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
stuff that we like and with the gate

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.299 
stuff that we like and with the gate
feature<00:00:35.470> really<00:00:36.470> put<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.800> over<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.100> top

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
feature really put it over the top

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.660 
feature really put it over the top
because<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:37.610> can<00:00:37.879> just<00:00:38.830> get<00:00:39.830> just<00:00:40.309> really

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
because you can just get just really

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.450 
because you can just get just really
scary<00:00:41.000> tones<00:00:41.330> and<00:00:42.140> then<00:00:42.410> when<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.620> let<00:00:42.830> off<00:00:43.010> it

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
scary tones and then when you let off it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.140 
scary tones and then when you let off it
just<00:00:43.489> sucks<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.570> up<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:44.900> just<00:00:45.350> sucks<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.739> to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
just sucks it up it just sucks it to

in<00:01:08.750> quarantine<00:01:09.170> at<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.530> end<00:01:09.680> there's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
in quarantine at the end there's

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.779 
in quarantine at the end there's
actually<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.340> noise<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:13.220> slowing<00:01:13.610> down

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
actually a noise that is slowing down

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.389 
actually a noise that is slowing down
with<00:01:14.300> sort<00:01:14.600> of<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.750> hard<00:01:14.960> cut<00:01:15.140> trim<00:01:15.410> well<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.369> I

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
with sort of a hard cut trim well so I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.279 
with sort of a hard cut trim well so I
needed<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.000> chop<00:01:17.330> off<00:01:17.539> completely<00:01:17.990> which

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
needed it to chop off completely which

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.290 
needed it to chop off completely which
is<00:01:18.440> what<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.770> j-just

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.490 
then I said an infinite delay on the d7
and<00:02:33.219> I've<00:02:34.219> been<00:02:34.579> it's<00:02:35.209> getting<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.170> sound

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and I've been it's getting that sound

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.300 
and I've been it's getting that sound
with<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> JH<00:02:37.189> s<00:02:37.370> mod<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.810> tramp<00:02:38.810> boss<00:02:39.709> travel

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
with the JH s mod a tramp boss travel

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.630 
with the JH s mod a tramp boss travel
and<00:02:40.609> it<00:02:40.849> does<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> hard<00:02:41.390> cut<00:02:41.689> which<00:02:42.640> really

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and it does a hard cut which really

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.420 
and it does a hard cut which really
almost<00:02:44.510> exactly<00:02:45.170> gets<00:02:45.739> what<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.069> were<00:02:46.159> going

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
almost exactly gets what we were going

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.479 
almost exactly gets what we were going
for<00:02:46.609> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.879> album<00:02:47.560> it's<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.739> really<00:02:49.280> cool

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
for on the album it's a really cool

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.819 
for on the album it's a really cool
effect<00:02:49.840> because<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.109> chop<00:02:51.349> off<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
effect because you can chop off the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.309 
effect because you can chop off the
sound<00:02:52.459> super<00:02:52.760> slow<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.599> get<00:02:53.719> it<00:02:53.840> going<00:02:53.930> super

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
sound super slow and get it going super

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.230 
sound super slow and get it going super
fast

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.080

okay guys so that's my rig hope it helps
a<00:03:04.180> little<00:03:04.270> bit<00:03:04.620> JHS<00:03:05.620> has<00:03:05.830> been<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.360> very<00:03:07.360> crucial

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
a little bit JHS has been a very crucial

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.510 
a little bit JHS has been a very crucial
part<00:03:07.960> of<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.320> when<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.010> putting<00:03:09.280> together

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
part of it when I was putting together

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.250 
part of it when I was putting together
trying<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.240> figure<00:03:10.390> out<00:03:10.600> how<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> make<00:03:10.990> all<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
trying to figure out how to make all the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.460 
trying to figure out how to make all the
sounds<00:03:11.620> work<00:03:12.450> actually<00:03:13.450> only<00:03:13.900> used<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.320> use

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
sounds work actually only used to use

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.490 
sounds work actually only used to use
three<00:03:14.770> or<00:03:14.830> four<00:03:14.920> pedals<00:03:15.370> before<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:16.500> so

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
three or four pedals before this so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.500 
three or four pedals before this so
going<00:03:18.250> through<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.550> hundreds<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.970> brands

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
going through the hundreds of brands

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.590 
going through the hundreds of brands
pedals<00:03:20.170> it's<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:21.210> mind-boggling

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
pedals it's just mind-boggling

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.070 
pedals it's just mind-boggling
so<00:03:23.280> JHS<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.580> found<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.090> was<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.420> huge<00:03:25.780> help

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
so JHS when I found it was a huge help

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.140 
so JHS when I found it was a huge help
and<00:03:26.290> they<00:03:26.560> had<00:03:26.710> just<00:03:27.430> about<00:03:27.610> everything<00:03:27.910> I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and they had just about everything I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150 
and they had just about everything I
needed<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.560> they're<00:03:29.710> doing<00:03:29.830> delays

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
needed and now that they're doing delays

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.090 
needed and now that they're doing delays
I<00:03:30.700> don't<00:03:31.660> know<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.140> might<00:03:32.410> end<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.680> doing<00:03:32.740> them

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
I don't know I might end up doing them

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.090
