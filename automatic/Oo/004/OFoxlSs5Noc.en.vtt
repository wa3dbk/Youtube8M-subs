00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 we are here again in red 17-15 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.530
 and let's start as for how to ride 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.929
 a bike 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.929
 from scratch let's start 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.160
 with the tools normally if 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 You wear pecs or you wear footpegs too 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 stress 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 how 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 you see your teacher 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.810
 for music 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.810
 butter without complication 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.600
 but with music 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 with him they brought out two or more highlights 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470
 first name 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.280
 a pipe wrench for text now 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.170
 if you do not have text you can also use 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.190
 a spanner of these normal and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.440
 adjustable but I do not have around here 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.840
 They are usually keys to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.560
 back in front are 17 keys like 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 is in my case the back of 19 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.580
 the front is 17 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580
 but 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.399
 but but but good 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.060
 I'm going to take another wheel that is not mine 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.880
 I have it here from now on so much remains of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.250
 the red radios 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 which in this case is 15 walks and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.240
 15 keys also still missing someone 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.570
 of number 6 and I think the 5 the best 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.170
 to follow and it's already for six 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 powers 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.040
 in my case 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.520
 my foot those that use a pipe wrench 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520
 as well 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.520
 it's worth a pipe wrench 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:14.000
 to touch someone also he has 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.960
 now there is also a chain lane 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.240
 to trade the chain 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.240
 and a mass 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 it's covered we're going to be able to hit 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.190
 the club does not hammer 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 he does not know what a hammer is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.280
 the most is there 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.190
 I was watching encrypted drawings follow 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.680
 being a hammer and you know what it is 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.430
 a mace is this that is to take care of the price 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.490
 of the Chinese but does not mark the price anymore 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.940
 a mass 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.720
 I knew what it's for, it's not plastic 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.130
 to hit and not break not to scratch like 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860
 a hammer that is iron and iron 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.030
 against iron qualify after the coup 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.030
 and dies 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.880
 and well I think that's good 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 also screwdriver for 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.230
 for the plugs 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.760
 and this is going back and you have to put that they are 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.760
 screwdriver me too
