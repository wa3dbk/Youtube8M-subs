00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to all the pilots on the internet 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome back this new episode of mine 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.820
 lex place minecraft is today there is one thing 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 not so beautiful to say in the sense that 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 that's why the ex play could be 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 the end has come 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 now I'll explain why 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.039
 I had also brought myself quite ahead to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.140
 cameras off 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.900
 if you remember the past he had beaten 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.830
 all trees now replanted all 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 we had also collected the wood of the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 jungle 12 at the bottom I improvised one 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.309
 cocoa farm not automatic but manual 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 and nothing now I'll explain you better 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.010
 because you simply exit the exit 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.210
 of the first snap shot towards the 1.6 of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 minecraft is there 1.7 excuse the snap shot 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:58.340
 13 v 36 a and 36 b is has been found 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.520
 that is a novelty one of the most 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 consistent we say is a modification of the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.450
 world generator and is a modification 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 from a heavy change in the sense that I have 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.729
 also heard in various videos to which 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 they were talking about this snapshots 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.119
 that could cause bugs in the worlds 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.909
 generated with 1.6 or earlier because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.320
 for example when there is an area of 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.670
 border between a bathroom and the other one comes 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.930
 to create a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.930
 a bug that is a clear cut of the del 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.580
 bayonne there is almost the usual bug I have 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 felt that it should be 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.439
 also resolved this baghdad on 1.7 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 this bug of the generation of the worlds 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.030
 that you see that it does not turn generates itself 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 sausage notes close and have been 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.000
 also corrected the problems of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.799
 elimination bug lighting 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.149
 I don't know if this is the display 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.080
 carry it forward 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.140
 I really think not because yes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.460
 could pay the world but not only 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 since they were really added 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 lots of news including a lot 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 of new bayonne in this world meanwhile 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.930
 the bay surely move by the hundred 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.989
 hundred will not be there even if per day 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.810
 the game 1.7 when I come out at 1.7 of 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.250
 vaio the new ones there will be no quan 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.010
 even if we go to a part not yet 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.170
 generated and therefore already the game becomes 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.040
 more boring because there are not all 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.239
 new and then it's a mess and that's why 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.340
 since we haven't reached a point 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.959
 the former play is very advanced 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.310
 in fact I would say that they are just starting out 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 i found some iron this ho 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.180
 made this asus this contraption 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:51.030
 here and they do not deserve cocoa either 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.459
 to be spoken robinson stay e 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.480
 so and guys i spend this 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.180
 display already a small series for 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.670
 wait for 1.7 to start a new one 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 display there was this I express I put in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 pause let's say until it comes out of 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.730
 1.7 when 1.7 is released if obviously 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.220
 the things of this last one are confirmed 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.019
 snap shot, that is to say that there are precisely one 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.120
 rebuy oh but surely they are confirmed 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.180
 and worlds worlds coach trainer is 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.370
 the former was completely changed 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.660
 play I deleted it from the channel mi 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.829
 very sorry because it was enough 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.920
 following 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.590
 in short, it is not in the sense that it was 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.500
 quite followed I am sorry indeed 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.640
 and yet it makes no sense to move forward 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.590
 boys 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.150
 at this point we are waiting for 1.7 e 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.920
 let's start a super let's play and let's do 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.349
 really seriously in the sense that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.190
 we build that we will stay several things 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.690
 we will go exploring many caverns 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.250
 things also because with the buy on web of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.080
 guys do n't know if you've seen gods 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.290
 Video on the snapshot that is on his 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.110
 epic story of the penalty released by 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.459
 13:30 6 and b there are bayonne 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.799
 really really very very very beautiful 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.590
 and said this nothing 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.110
 I leave this ep this the former play so 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.260
 we leave it practically until when 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:20.540
 1.7 will be born and we will start another one 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.250
 when 1.7 comes out, I'll call him 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.260
 in fact, this display is the same 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.260
 I will eliminate will not start the splaine 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
 always called the former play minecraft ita 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.039
 with episode number ie episode 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.350
 123456 etc. etc. 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.820
 this time I will not start them 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.260
 more also because I don't think there will be a 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.080
 I don't think any other pair and I hope not 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.700
 and nothing, so let's wait for 1.7 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.370
 I hope it comes soon but I think ai 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.010
 early October should already come out 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.900
 I think and I don't know, but it could be 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.760
 give and say that for this video it is 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.669
 I have already mentioned to you all that I have 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.070
 in mind a new series on minecraft 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.039
 a miniseries let's say a miniseries 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.650
 precisely presented by 1.7 which will deal with 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.200
 of red stone mainly of machines 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.880
 of machinery and nothing for this video 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.620
 It is everything and we'll see you at the next 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.810
 video and hello everyone and I'm sorry 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.460
 still a lot for this inconvenience but 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.050
 I assure you that the best thing is this 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.479
 because it could really brawl the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.160
 world and thank you for following me 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.990
