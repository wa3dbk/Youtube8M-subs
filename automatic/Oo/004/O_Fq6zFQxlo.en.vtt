00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
although the software seems complicated

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.350 
although the software seems complicated
it's<00:01:16.259> definitely<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.280> hundred<00:01:17.909> percent<00:01:20.360> very

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's definitely a hundred percent very

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's definitely a hundred percent very
useful<00:01:21.869> software<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.850> I'll<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.119> you

you'll<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.570> more<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.900> move<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
you'll see that the more you move to the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.220 
you'll see that the more you move to the
left<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:46.100> better<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.670> quality<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:48.019> more

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
left the better the quality is the more

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.750 
left the better the quality is the more
you<00:02:48.320> move<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.800> right<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.190> better<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
you move to the right the better the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.240 
you move to the right the better the
lower<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.090> quality<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:51.500> problem<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
lower the quality is the problem is the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.060 
lower the quality is the problem is the
more<00:02:52.430> as<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.360> move<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.080> left<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
more as you move it more to the left the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.560 
more as you move it more to the left the
quality<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.550> better<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> file<00:02:56.300> size<00:02:56.540> is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
quality is better but the file size is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.840 
quality is better but the file size is
going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> be<00:02:56.989> huge<00:02:57.470> way<00:02:58.100> bigger<00:02:58.310> than<00:02:58.640> normal

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
going to be huge way bigger than normal

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.600 
going to be huge way bigger than normal
and<00:02:59.410> the<00:03:00.410> more<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.680> move<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.160> right<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
and the more you move to the right the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.910 
and the more you move to the right the
file<00:03:02.090> size<00:03:02.330> will<00:03:02.570> be<00:03:02.720> less<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> top<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
file size will be less but the top the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.770 
file size will be less but the top the
quality<00:03:04.989> will<00:03:05.989> also<00:03:06.320> be<00:03:06.500> lower<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.390> 14<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.570> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
quality will also be lower so 14 is a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.090 
quality will also be lower so 14 is a
good<00:03:08.870> number<00:03:09.410> 14

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
good number 14

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.640 
good number 14
I<00:03:10.130> noticed<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:11.150> keep<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.780> exact<00:03:12.049> quality<00:03:12.530> of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650
