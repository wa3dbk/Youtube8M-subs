00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700
 Yes 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.520
 hello to all and all these flashes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.720
 great since we are today 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
 on call of duty 4 modern warfare a game 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 we do not see any more on youtube 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.379
 and I still have on the chains 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.270
 Community and it's true that for 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.699
 me it's a shame because it is true that the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 game is full of hackers except there I 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.019
 you will officially admit that the game 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 is clean in land war is field 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.170
 battle 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 the game was a pure treat go for it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 call of duty 4 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.519
 take your baby out of the back of your 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.269
 console go on call of duty 4 and in 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.969
 battlefield 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.039
 you will see you are going to make yourself a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 pleasure you will do massages 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.500
 you will enjoy the collections 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 are drinkable 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.559
 even if we come across collections 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 of a weekend it is true that the game 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 is not a problem you can always do 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.920
 big gameplay and especially there I have 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.660
 you admit that good after the score is 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 not exceptional it will not be a plus 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.750
 without as you are used to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 see on community channels or 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.759
 still on my channel but it's a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 gameplay down the score and basic but 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.070
 you'll see that throughout the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.320
 gameplay neither your hips and in front of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 enemies nor your displacements you will be 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 satisfied it's 100% rock like 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.049
 usually me it is true that I do not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 not to camp I do not know if 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.810
 you have the patience to stay in one 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.310
 truck two or three seconds 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.720
 me anyway I can not stay 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.400
 more than three seconds of the mobile needs 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.350
 that I move for I sought the elect 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.390
 me when I go to a party I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.650
 have to go get the shows I'm 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 say it's a basic gameplay of 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.860
 shit what simply 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.299
 so this gameplay I will try to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.979
 send it to coop iga co2 serves all 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.170
 just because I try to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.490
 offer gameplay to the community and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 to officially announce that the game is 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.549
 clean why not do not do a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 back on because it's true that see 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.490
 all the time from the black ops of 24 24 on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 the two community channels 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.960
 it can annoy some and why not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.659
 to go back to the roots in 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 having this gameplay under the eyes and for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.390
 introduce his gameplay 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.760
 I'll talk about a subject or 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 even debate on a topic that can be 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.819
 interesting to the community that we 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.859
 concerns all 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.019
 that's why little vision infinity 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.370
 ward or even treyarch do not maintain 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.139
 not their servers on the old call 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.769
 of duty and give especially do not put them 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.560
 outdated 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.060
 why and well just me I 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.709
 do not know maybe they are 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.359
 more focused on their current opus 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.030
 and then after that leaves on the side 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.500
 especially after I say to myself finally here is a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.120
 post it's going to be a pity because when 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.939
 we are looking at games that are ultra 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.530
 connected as black of the web w3c 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.780
 comes call of duty elite 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.040
 imagine with the next gen how the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.700
 games will be abandoned because of their 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.709
 features 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.870
 it will be exactly the same with the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.489
 playstation network of the ps2 course that 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.620
 will do the same business and I find that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.989
 pity because it's true that call of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 duty 4 and call of duty 5 especially on our 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.959
 very good games why the neglected 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.340
 as much it is perhaps the best 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.909
 opus that were designed on this 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.459
 generation 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.810
 so why well I do not know 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.639
 it's a financial question 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.469
 everyone finally knows even god knows 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.569
 that they are all ways to maintain 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.560
 their servers on after I do not know 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.599
 nothing a video made the buzz like what 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.090
 call of duty summer hacked and robert bowling 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.739
 replied on twitter what the code 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.180
 game security were already registered 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.400
 in the database where the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.090
 development finally the code what the code 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.189
 source of the game 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.629
 the security code already registration does not 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.609
 can not change it because otherwise this 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.019
 will be total modification of all 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.389
 copies sold it's actually a lot 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.989
 too much that's at least a total it's 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.699
 more than gta iv imagine is by the way 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.489
 yielded 4 and the best-selling opus I'm going 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.139
 not hide me and especially cod5 what is 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.060
 much more damage because cod 5 that's 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.530
 the day I spent the most hours and 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 it is true that it is a magnificent game 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.549
 you have to go for a ride 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.629
 I did not try to see 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.669
 gameplay I try to propose to you 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.379
 finally it's true that on my account but 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.629
 on my advanced account if we propose 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.120
 a gameplay I have all rentiers and I 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.340
 find it a shame indeed 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.329
 it was negative xp I have more access to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.299
 public parts etc 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.430
 and it's true that it's a shame 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.540
 because cod 5 is an excellent game it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.609
 is completely abandoned by the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.889
 community and on top of that the servers 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.500
 are moldy and adding that behind 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.280
 it is full of hackers so that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.810
 ben 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.609
 here is the game is unplayable for the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.109
 moment and it's a shame because 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.560
 cod 5 is perhaps the best 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.389
 transition never performed on an opus 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.490
 it is true that they had the courage 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.740
 treyarch to do some gameplay in order to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.120
 make an opus mostly to center the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.680
 gameplay based on call of duty 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.810
 what is the second world war because 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.430
 as a reminder if you're not a 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.660
 old like me I mean it's 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.880
 true that when I feel like 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.880
 talk about ecology tisha grandfather because 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.320
 that I started on cod a pc and he 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.120
 is true that the ecologists base is 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.910
 the second world war treyarch has 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.100
 taken again this base is there provided to the opus 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.320
 generation she is posted the shepherdess and 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.500
 treyarch put it on the opus of next 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.990
 gen 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.460
 so they had courage they did 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.290
 the game worked very well anyway 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.090
 for me the transition was not hard 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.600
 since I made cod 3 ps below 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.030
 of 5 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.130
 I bought cod4 then it's just that 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.190
 cod4 I have a little start in the universe 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.900
 of tim etc and this from 5am ​​and I started 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.070
 to make game battle and it's not good 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.720
 it's true that it's a game in which 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.669
 I spent a lot of hours and I do not 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.870
 will never regret those moments it is 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.010
 true that I lost a lot of friends 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.300
 cravings from elsewhere and I would like them 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.820
 find but it's a shame because 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.320
 I lost the game cod5 his mark 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.850
 the story of my first team ma 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.210
 first sentence movie but first 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.740
 video 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.840
 this drawing that he has all marked 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.310
 frankly it's a game I love and 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.050
 it's true that it's a shame finally 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.570
 frankly I do not know what is 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.979
 your point of view about that good 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.539
 after that it's true that it does not concern 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.590
 too many who played the new call 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.919
 of duty for example those who have 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.360
 started on mw2 not especially on w3 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.190
 because bmw he's stuffed with 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.780
 hackers right now but people 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.610
 like me who played the old cod 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.169
 it's a shame to have frankly I 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.789
 you leave cars that in any case 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.830
 I leave you on this score of 38 2 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.729
 it was flash I thank even more 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.190
 i'm listening 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.000
 if the map aude and I tell you more 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.000
 for future videos
