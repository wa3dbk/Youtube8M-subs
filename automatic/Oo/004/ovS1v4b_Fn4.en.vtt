00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.289 
that domain change it to her use it in
in<00:01:11.500> league<00:01:12.500> with<00:01:13.100> all<00:01:13.280> their<00:01:13.430> stuff<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
in league with all their stuff in the

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.700 
in league with all their stuff in the
six<00:01:14.510> steps<00:01:15.460> hope<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.640> made<00:01:16.820> sense<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.840> step

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
six steps hope that made sense so step

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.580 
six steps hope that made sense so step
two<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.220> profit<00:01:19.850> stack<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.659> Prophet<00:01:21.320> stack

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
two is profit stack the Prophet stack

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.390 
two is profit stack the Prophet stack
really<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:23.320> what<00:01:24.940> sacrifice<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.090> tube<00:01:27.250> I'm<00:01:28.250> not

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
really is what sacrifice I tube I'm not

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.130 
really is what sacrifice I tube I'm not
going<00:01:28.580> down<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.909> steps<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.510> confuses

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
going down the steps that just confuses

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.789 
going down the steps that just confuses
me<00:01:30.260> unless<00:01:30.470> i'm<00:01:30.650> watching<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.010> video

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
me unless i'm watching the video

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.840 
me unless i'm watching the video
basically<00:01:33.799> there's<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.979> video<00:01:34.189> for<00:01:34.490> each<00:01:34.549> step

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
basically there's a video for each step

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.160 
basically there's a video for each step
so<00:01:34.880> there's<00:01:35.270> not<00:01:35.390> too<00:01:35.540> many<00:01:35.630> videos<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.140> watch

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
so there's not too many videos to watch

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.020 
so there's not too many videos to watch
I<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.710> watched<00:01:36.920> them<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.460> just<00:01:37.760> got

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
I just watched them and I just got

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.580 
I just watched them and I just got
access<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.750> about<00:01:41.110> I'm<00:01:42.110> thinking<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
access to it about I'm thinking is that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.880
