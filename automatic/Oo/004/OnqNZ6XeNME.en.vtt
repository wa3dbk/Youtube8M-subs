00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 Hi, I'm Cherub Ryder and this time we're going 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.430
 to give a fast rhythm of the camera 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 sad the boost model I just bought 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 this camera 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.490
 in fact five minutes ago and it's going to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.359
 show how it comes how it comes from box 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.949
 this camera cost me $ 400 and we're going 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.739
 to do this review of this great camera 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 in Spanish because I think that already in truth 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.989
 we have many many very good 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059
 bloggers who do reviews in English of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 this same model is worth it what 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 see, it's worth it to put them 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.900
 attention because those are very technical 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.750
 details 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.020
 I'm going to do it faster but if 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.800
 can see the blogs 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.700
 of the camera lost good so the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.550
 box so comes the camera comes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.210
 excellently well packaged well 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.280
 first with this cardboard packaging and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.070
 in comes the camera 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 this we are going to put it here comes the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 goat in a plastic package 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 something that catches my attention 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.330
 now that I went to buy all the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.510
 cameras action cameras have focused 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 much in the packaging I do not know why but 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.140
 all the auto focus the others accept 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.720
 which are very beautiful and it seems that they are 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 made so that when you give us your camera 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.440
 have a case and where they keep the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 note are not very showy and good 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.830
 obviously drive I do not know did not stay behind 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 this is the box the camera comes subject to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.880
 this plastic step 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.660
 we do not need this is the camera is the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.940
 camera coast excellent camera very very 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.520
 good camera especially if you 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.430
 they want a camera for their motorcycle helmet 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.230
 or your helmet on a bicycle or in 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.270
 are actually parachutists when what 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.960
 that they give is a skydiving helmet that 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.300
 put in what they have to put on 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.700
 the helmet to ski or whatever it is 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 very good camera because it calls me the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.200
 attention this camera good unlike 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 of the goal models but the others 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.610
 go pro models I never have a bought 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 but I have friends who have it and I've 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.710
 used at some time but it is very 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 uncomfortable very very uncomfortable to have 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.330
 a piece of camera so big in the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.130
 helmet and above all that is nothing 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.590
 aerodynamic that people are left 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 Seeing how they do not know you're 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.780
 doing and I think that is not the case 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 Libya worried is a very very model 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.910
 very light, actually very small and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.940
 very very aerodynamic no it does not look so so 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.450
 striking like the other and probably 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.660
 if the camera the go pro would like it for 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 my motorcycle that was subject to the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 some bike at a time I think that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.600
 it can be good camera but 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.750
 definitely coaster the camera is 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.390
 drifter is perfect has everything 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
 well I'm happy with this camera and the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.620
 release and we'll see the reviews and the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.250
 use but good to focus a bit on how 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.600
 comes comes with good and packaged 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.160
 this is the most important thing this camera 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.760
 that personally calls me the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.980
 Attention 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.130
 well I love this is a control 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.380
 remote that has LEDs and each LED according to 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.030
 the color that you have you can know if 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.459
 are you recording or not what's up with these 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.130
 good cameras because sometimes you learn and not 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.930
 you know if he's recording and that will be 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.000
 it will have paid to have turned on but not 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.950
 I remembered if I turned on or off 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.560
 then better but at the station I do not 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.820
 he removed the helmet and I see no longer with this 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.250
 they understand a problem 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.050
 the lights here the LEDs from this side 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.520
 is going to tell you what are you doing 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.410
 taking focus still photo 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.720
 then recording the video if you turn it off 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.239
 you if you're on standby everything if there's 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 connection everything is going to tell you and this 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.840
 gadget this remote control what 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.940
 you can put in your hand or you can 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.650
 put on the motorcycle somewhere 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.180
 wherever it is to learn it and turn it off and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.870
 always have this information then 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.959
 this makes me excellent 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.260
 here we have to make a part of the 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.260
 box 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.930
 well here all that what you include 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.660
 What is it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.660
 and practically together 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.809
 good 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.569
 who are including us are 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:40.230

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.040
 is to load it 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.460
 we are including this kit this kit 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.000
 is to put on your goals 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.160

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.460
 we have an adapter these adapters 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.319
 for your microphone with the input 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.500
 because it is bigger, smaller, you can 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.140
 put 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.370
 is the universal clip of this camera this 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.010
 team is a wonder 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.440
 unlike google good then you have 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.200
 have my clip without screws and are 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.230
 a thousand things this one not because you put it here 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.540
 in your camera and you forget this team of 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.380
 sense art you can insert it in 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.090
 any of the east of the 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.660
 special mounts then this will 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.570
 makes it very comfortable 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.450
 they are giving us another clip here that is 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.190
 is for a triple made for the great 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.110
 liza surface 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.990
 and this is a clip 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.510
 round concave I do not know how you can 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.910
 say and this is for you a helmet this what 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.889
 you hit the helmet and it looks great 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.379
 plus is such 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.520
 we are your battery here is the 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.160
 camera battery 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.360
 this is a stage that in the part of 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.860
 back I was here and it's for water not 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.750
 is finished can put as I think 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.030
 three meters I'm not sure but I think 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.440
 that are three meters and well here they come 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.620
 the instructions give you some 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.620
 stickers 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.380
 very well this is the box from which 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.510
 comes then I think if I do not 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.020
 you are using you go to aguada for long 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.820
 periods 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.370
 forget we have a case and the pizza 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.350
 I loved it here I loved this model 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.300
 drift that they included all this me 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.970
 It cost 400 hours to attend the page 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.410
 web they tell you that they are 400 hours is very 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.180
 well priced but they also included 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:32.259
 this other 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.229
 lens mold included me one 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.539
 extra battery that is here and I 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.280
 They included the lenses that are 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.380
 lenses not in case in case it breaks 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.080
 this one here or have it changes we're going to 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.139
 that this one choose to change it and I 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.270
 they included 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.020
 this 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.020
 this 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.560
 they are bad for the drift but 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.449
 obviously one stops a car but that 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.830
 It's very good because if you're not 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.840
 using it on your motorcycle and you have a car 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.650
 good you can put all this 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.650
 they gave for 400 dollars 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.479
 here what includes you good because this 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.449
 I want it in the box does not include more no 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.820
 I know why I never saw anything on the page 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.650
 web that will include these three things else 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.970
 but playing I'm happy that the 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.770
 included and cost for 400 dollars 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.229
 I hope you like the review this is 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.759
 as the camera comes, I recommend them 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.740
 much I think obsidian the 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.110
 motorcyclist or wings on bicycle or value 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.259
 you want something comfortable in your helmet this is 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.539
 the way to go this is the formula of the 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.370
 drive ghosts we will use it I will 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:40.970
 try and then we will do a review more 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.259
 more more technical to see how it works 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.259
 this camera and what advantages or disadvantages 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:48.050
 you have but good for now it's all 

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:50.270
 I am fermin riders who like it and good 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.430
 let's move forward with this camera and 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.289
 we will continue next to motorcycles and travel 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.289
 and all thanks and I hope you enjoy it
