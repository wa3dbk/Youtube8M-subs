00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.170
 what's up kids or siham to charge me 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.269
 I distracted a new tutorial on how 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.340
 put commands on the server that great 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.870
 question that you have all asked me in the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 video of how to create a server 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.100
 minecraft are going to have the link how 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.870
 create a minecraft server in the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.700
 description and on the screen itself 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.920
 one has not seen and want to create a 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.510
 server I have a tutorial how 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 do it pretty well explained by 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.580
 true then it serves for any 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 version in the good tutorial we continue 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.680
 so if we want to put commands that 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.170
 we have to make it very easy to start 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.899
 our server is worth the version that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.079
 it does not matter whether the 1.6 point 2 is the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.030
 1.7 point 20 no matter what version it is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 the version in all the tutorials of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 how to create a server and everything will be 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 same if you already change a new tutorial 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.690
 quiet that does not panda the only 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 then we start our server ok 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 all right all right perfect 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.540
 so what do we have to do to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 put commands well first thing you see 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.379
 all these are good all these 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.980
 letters this is what is generating the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 server is so played 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.170
 will appear if there are players inside a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.659
 graphic but good we have to go 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.040
 here here to this bar down here and 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.590
 here we can write whatever we want 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.820
 ok we can quickly write what 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.100
 you have to do to put some commands 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.650
 he first the master command is 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.650
 I just pray and your name 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.600
 user for example pepito sites 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.310
 you call pepito then you put or pepito without 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.960
 bars and with nothing here you have to put 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.000
 or pepito and pop &amp; pepito now pepito that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.810
 eg you can use all the commands that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 want if you want to operate op 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.930
 pepito pepito and is no longer open I think that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.300
 you understand it is not to say 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.479
 the open is the master command that serves 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.580
 to be able to use other commands from 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.259
 agreement then from here also 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.950
 you can put the command that is for 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.770
 example game boat 1 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.450
 pepito scene the bar sorry the bar not 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.310
 it takes worth as an appetite then 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.660
 the player has not been found 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.399
 obviously because there is no player 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.560
 on the server there is no pepito but 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.610
 if there was a pepito then I repeat now 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.240
 same would be in creative mode 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.290
 basically 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.070
 if you want to put it back in game or 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.770
 survival flat of zero change and the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.680
 name of the player basically that more 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.480
 commands then in the list of commands or 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.270
 work on the description is worth if I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.670
 agreement but the master command to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.380
 to be able to use commands is the open 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.330
 have nothing else once you put ope and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.950
 the name of the player is the player 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.060
 You can use commands inside your 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.410
 server agree then what else 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.060
 you will tell me but you can only put 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 commands from here not if you get in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.020
 the minecraft you can also put 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.060
 m3 commands on the server but you have 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.610
 Well, I'm not going to explain it to you from 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.200
 the main clear we see each other and we're already 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.300
 inside the server so you can see 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.010
 it explodes again the computer that 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.780
 first because I have a server and the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.520
 main graph open the fax recording and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.620
 Well, the computer is going to explode 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.240
 so if you hear a quiet boom but 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.040
 good if you want to put commands inside 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.480
 from the server first thing you have had 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.599
 that put ops from outside from him 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.580
 the tab leaves I left that I've 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.040
 taught before you have to put the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.459
 ope and you can put from within the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.940
 server giving the good tie to the key 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.769
 that you have for the chat giving the chat 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.370
 putting a bar and putting the command 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.040
 you want the memo of one and you can 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.540
 put yourselves the commands and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.569
 if you want to apply the command to another 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.730
 player you put game or of one and the name 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.260
 of player for example pepito and here 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.540
 we are using pepito before 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.489
 let's go to pepito we could find 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.579
 the player because he is not connected as 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.150
 You see, I'm just my server, so 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.370
 well that and they do not have much more 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.350
 you already know the list of commands you are going to 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.770
 have in him 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.530
 in the description of the video and good nothing 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.570
 more than anyone ask me for the ip 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.830
 my server because it is private or is 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.870
 I will not give 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.910
 and yet I have a way list so I do not 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.860
 you can enter but nothing if you want 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.060
 enter yes if you want to enter not if 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.640
 you want to play with me to follow me 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.900
 twitter and on twitter I put from time to 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.460
 when when I'm going to get into a 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.320
 server I put it on twitter I put the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.030
 ip you put and games with me does not have 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.710
 much more I also have a channel 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.270
 minecraft to which I upload videos from 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.220
 minecraft this is not the channel of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.230
 minecraft this is the gameplays channel 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.190
