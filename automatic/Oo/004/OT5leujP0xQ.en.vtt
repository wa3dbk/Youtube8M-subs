00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
and we buried it for six months and

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.260 
and we buried it for six months and
fired<00:00:13.800> it<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.010> fruit<00:00:14.309> day<00:00:14.490> today<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> also<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
fired it on fruit day today is also a

fired it on fruit day today is also a
birthday<00:00:15.600> lots<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.710> mold<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.550> strange<00:00:18.200> colors

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220

birthday lots of mold and strange colors
all<00:00:20.220> sorts<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> things<00:00:20.790> growing<00:00:21.360> on<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
all sorts of things growing on this

all sorts of things growing on this
maggots<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.029> don't<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:26.369> afterwards

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
maggots I don't know but then afterwards

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.890 
maggots I don't know but then afterwards
when<00:00:27.360> we<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.930> apart<00:00:28.310> scrape<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> out

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
when we take this apart scrape it out

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
when we take this apart scrape it out
scrape<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.050> flowers<00:00:31.470> off<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.000> inside

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
scrape all the flowers off of the inside

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.920 
scrape all the flowers off of the inside
and<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.260> looking<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> other<00:00:35.629> skull<00:00:36.629> here

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and I'm looking for the other skull here

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.700 
and I'm looking for the other skull here
I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:38.030> here's<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> skulls

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
I think this is them here's the skulls

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.140 
I think this is them here's the skulls
is<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> preparation<00:00:41.760> we're

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
is that this is the preparation we're

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.939 
is that this is the preparation we're
gathering<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.190> anaerobic<00:00:44.580> one<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
gathering here it's an anaerobic one so

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.930 
gathering here it's an anaerobic one so
it's<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.040> first<00:00:47.280> time<00:00:47.370> they've<00:00:47.580> seen<00:00:47.790> in<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it's the first time they've seen in the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
it's the first time they've seen in the
air<00:00:48.089> goat<00:00:48.510> school<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> sheep's<00:00:49.440> color

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
air goat school or a sheep's color

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
air goat school or a sheep's color
something<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> i<00:00:50.309> don't<00:00:50.400> really<00:00:51.059> know

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
something like that i don't really know

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.899 
something like that i don't really know
it<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.870> wrapped<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.320> cabbage<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> was

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
it was wrapped in cabbage and it was

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.850 
it was wrapped in cabbage and it was
buried<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.540> this<00:00:54.930> Creek<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.589> right

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
buried in this this Creek here right

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.259 
buried in this this Creek here right
where<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> water<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.400> kind<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> more<00:00:56.909> still

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
where the water was kind of more still

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.560 
where the water was kind of more still
so<00:00:57.540> this<00:00:58.229> is<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> stag's<00:00:58.830> bladder<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.570> inside

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
so this is a stag's bladder and inside

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
so this is a stag's bladder and inside
it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.620> yarrow<00:01:01.890> flower<00:01:01.979> as<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.400> say<00:01:02.549> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it is the yarrow flower as I say the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.000 
it is the yarrow flower as I say the
arrow<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.239> flowers<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.629> supposed<00:01:03.900> to<00:01:04.010> still

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
arrow the flowers are supposed to still

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.719 
arrow the flowers are supposed to still
be<00:01:05.220> intact<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> bladder<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.729> hostile

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
be intact by this bladder is so hostile

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.500 
be intact by this bladder is so hostile
it's<00:01:08.909> supposed<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:10.490> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.580> vibe<00:01:11.970> degraded

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it's supposed to kind of vibe degraded

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's supposed to kind of vibe degraded
but<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:13.500> still<00:01:13.979> happening<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but I'm still happening so there it is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
but I'm still happening so there it is
there's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.210> 502<00:01:21.110> ok<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> five

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
there's the 502 ok so this is the five

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.740 
there's the 502 ok so this is the five
the<00:01:23.640> famous<00:01:23.970> 500<00:01:24.630> preparation<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the famous 500 preparation which is

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.410 
the famous 500 preparation which is
manure<00:01:27.830> from<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:29.010> lactating<00:01:29.460> cow

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.640 

let's<00:01:33.049> put<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.380> into

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.940 

its<00:01:40.010> horns<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.110> see<00:01:42.260> this<00:01:42.410> white<00:01:42.620> stuff

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
its horns you can see this white stuff

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.110 
its horns you can see this white stuff
warming<00:01:43.430> all<00:01:43.520> around<00:01:43.730> that<00:01:43.820> means<00:01:43.970> it's

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
warming all around that means it's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.720 
warming all around that means it's
working<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.660> lots<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.110> life<00:01:45.730> happening

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
working this is lots of life happening

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.400 
working this is lots of life happening
in<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> I'm<00:01:49.190> just<00:01:49.370> using<00:01:50.410> homeopathic

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
in here so I'm just using homeopathic

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.740 
in here so I'm just using homeopathic
doses<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.550> these<00:01:52.880> things<00:01:53.210> because<00:01:53.570> the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
doses of these things because the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.020 
doses of these things because the
microbes<00:01:54.230> right<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:54.740> they<00:01:54.920> they<00:01:55.160> they<00:01:55.460> grow

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
microbes right so they they they grow

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.140 
microbes right so they they they grow
exponentially<00:01:56.930> they<00:01:57.620> have<00:01:57.800> warmth<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.580> heats

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
exponentially they have warmth and heats

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.770 
exponentially they have warmth and heats
and<00:01:59.390> stuff<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.870> eat<00:02:00.050> them<00:02:00.260> they<00:02:00.410> they<00:02:01.510> too<00:02:02.510> will

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and stuff to eat them they they too will

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.330 
and stuff to eat them they they too will
become<00:02:02.930> 2<00:02:03.260> billion<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.860> matter<00:02:04.040> of<00:02:04.160> hours

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
become 2 billion in a matter of hours

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.480 
become 2 billion in a matter of hours
sometimes<00:02:05.050> they<00:02:06.050> just<00:02:06.080> they<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.800> grow<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
sometimes they just they just grow and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.480 
sometimes they just they just grow and
they<00:02:07.520> stretch<00:02:07.820> out<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.229> little<00:02:09.800> bit<00:02:10.009> goes<00:02:10.429> a

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
they stretch out so a little bit goes a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.790 
they stretch out so a little bit goes a
long<00:02:10.670> way<00:02:11.530> basically<00:02:12.530> all<00:02:12.560> these

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
long way basically all these

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
long way basically all these
preparations<00:02:13.250> we're<00:02:13.730> adding<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> grant<00:02:14.360> every

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
preparations we're adding a grant every

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.690 
preparations we're adding a grant every
10<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.459> 15<00:02:17.209> tons<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.660> compost<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.770> each

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
10 and and 15 tons of compost and each

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
10 and and 15 tons of compost and each
one<00:02:19.940> holds<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.510> different<00:02:20.900> quality<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:22.190> an

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
one holds a different quality like an

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.160 
one holds a different quality like an
element<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.480> radiates<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
element that it that it radiates in the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.470 
element that it that it radiates in the
soil<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.650> these<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.580> essentially<00:02:26.030> working

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
soil and these are essentially working

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.990 
soil and these are essentially working
this<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.990> organs<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.220> compost

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
this like the organs of the compost

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.260 
this like the organs of the compost
heaps<00:02:30.490> yeah<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.670> guess<00:02:31.730> they'll<00:02:31.940> sit<00:02:32.120> here

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
heaps yeah and I guess they'll sit here

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.580 
heaps yeah and I guess they'll sit here
till<00:02:32.420> June<00:02:32.900> that's<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.320> you're<00:02:33.410> going<00:02:33.530> to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
till June that's when you're going to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.640 
till June that's when you're going to
eat<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.910> June<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:36.110> spread<00:02:36.320> them<00:02:36.500> all<00:02:36.590> over

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
eat it June will spread them all over

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.740 
eat it June will spread them all over
the<00:02:38.050> preparations<00:02:39.050> are<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.380> putting<00:02:40.690> all<00:02:41.690> of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
the preparations are you putting all of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.430 
the preparations are you putting all of
them<00:02:42.110> we're<00:02:42.950> doing<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.750> them<00:02:45.050> except<00:02:45.320> for

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
them we're doing all of them except for

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.800 
them we're doing all of them except for
the<00:02:45.560> metal<00:02:46.160> right<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:46.550> because<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:47.600> that'll

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the metal right now because then that'll

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.259 
the metal right now because then that'll
takes<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.110> year<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.530> I've<00:02:48.830> got<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.269> chamomile

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
takes a year and I've got the chamomile

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.440 
takes a year and I've got the chamomile
one<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:53.200> looks<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.350> weird<00:02:54.560> food<00:02:55.150> ok<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
one and looks like weird food ok so the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.259 
one and looks like weird food ok so the
503<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.290> stimulates<00:02:57.860> nitrogen<00:02:58.760> within<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
503 it stimulates nitrogen within the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.479 
503 it stimulates nitrogen within the
compost<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.959> increases<00:03:00.470> soil<00:03:00.739> life<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.310> as

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
compost and increases soil life so as

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.660 
compost and increases soil life so as
stimulating<00:03:02.800> plantation<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.519> this

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
stimulating plantation and what this

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.060 
stimulating plantation and what this
does<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.380> stimulates<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.620> relation

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
does is it stimulates the relation

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.290 
does is it stimulates the relation
between<00:03:07.390> silica<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.070> potassium<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
between silica and potassium so that the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.420 
between silica and potassium so that the
silica<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.870> attract<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.260> cosmic<00:03:12.620> forces<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
silica can attract the cosmic forces to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.960 
silica can attract the cosmic forces to
soil<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> arrow<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.100> see<00:03:16.280> some

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
soil so this is the arrow you see some

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.699 
soil so this is the arrow you see some
maggots<00:03:17.300> in<00:03:17.450> here<00:03:17.630> right<00:03:17.780> there's<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.530> old

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
maggots in here right there's this old

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.390 
maggots in here right there's this old
native<00:03:19.340> legend<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.940> when<00:03:20.660> when<00:03:21.050> when<00:03:21.400> they

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
native legend of when when when they

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000 
native legend of when when when they
were<00:03:22.489> creating<00:03:23.060> humans<00:03:23.600> when<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> gods<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
were creating humans when the gods the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.410 
were creating humans when the gods the
animal<00:03:25.280> gods<00:03:25.430> were<00:03:25.580> creating<00:03:25.940> humans<00:03:26.269> they

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
animal gods were creating humans they

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.470 
animal gods were creating humans they
couldn't<00:03:26.690> get<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> human<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:28.340> live<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.030> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
couldn't get the human to to live and it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.949 
couldn't get the human to to live and it
wasn't<00:03:29.780> until<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.200> fly<00:03:30.500> landed<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> human

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
wasn't until the fly landed on the human

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.090 
wasn't until the fly landed on the human
that<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.200> human<00:03:33.500> lived<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.890> was<00:03:33.980> actually

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
that the human lived so it was actually

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.759 
that the human lived so it was actually
fly<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:35.299> gave<00:03:35.480> birth<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.959> all<00:03:36.080> humanity<00:03:36.410> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
fly the gave birth to all humanity and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.570 
fly the gave birth to all humanity and
interesting<00:03:37.160> cuz

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
interesting cuz

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.190 
interesting cuz
it's<00:03:37.700> livens<00:03:38.150> preparation<00:03:38.690> they<00:03:38.810> eat<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
it's livens preparation they eat it and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.140 
it's livens preparation they eat it and
I<00:03:39.260> digest<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.800> i<00:03:39.890> think<00:03:39.950> that's<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.970> large

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
I digest it i think that's to a large

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.490 
I digest it i think that's to a large
degree<00:03:41.210> where<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.690> microbes<00:03:42.110> might<00:03:42.320> come

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
degree where the microbes might come

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.130 
degree where the microbes might come
from<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.790> know<00:03:43.880> David<00:03:44.390> Suzuki<00:03:44.840> studied

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
from and you know David Suzuki studied

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.260 
from and you know David Suzuki studied
maggots<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:45.620> how<00:03:45.740> he<00:03:45.890> got<00:03:46.010> his<00:03:46.190> start<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
maggots it's how he got his start in the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.790 
maggots it's how he got his start in the
world<00:03:47.450> was<00:03:47.660> studying<00:03:48.080> maggots<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.620> think

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
world was studying maggots so I think

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920 
world was studying maggots so I think
they're<00:03:49.090> more<00:03:50.090> important<00:03:50.450> than<00:03:50.540> we<00:03:50.660> might<00:03:50.780> get

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
they're more important than we might get

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.900 
they're more important than we might get
credit<00:03:51.350> for<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.670> yarrow

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and trace elements processes okay so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.050 
and trace elements processes okay so
this<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> 505<00:04:24.680> it's<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.520> oak<00:04:25.730> bark

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
this is the 505 it's the oak bark

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.250 
this is the 505 it's the oak bark

you know becoming enlivened adding

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.700 
you know becoming enlivened adding
oxygen<00:05:46.530> for<00:05:47.530> half<00:05:47.830> of<00:05:48.010> this<00:05:48.130> bucket<00:05:48.550> into

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
oxygen for half of this bucket into

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:58.770 
oxygen for half of this bucket into
holes<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:51.730> made<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:57.270> then<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.420> rest<00:05:58.570> of

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
holes that I made and then the rest of

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:10.380 
holes that I made and then the rest of
it<00:06:07.590> okay<00:06:08.590> so<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:09.430> now<00:06:09.580> that's<00:06:09.970> that's<00:06:10.300> pretty

going to put some of this in the complex

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.580 
going to put some of this in the complex
will<00:06:55.660> only<00:06:55.750> need<00:06:55.900> to<00:06:56.020> uh<00:06:56.050> knock<00:06:56.290> you<00:06:56.440> late

will only need to uh knock you late
these<00:06:56.710> piles<00:06:57.010> once<00:06:57.340> and<00:06:57.670> then<00:06:57.820> and<00:06:58.120> then<00:06:58.780> we

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
these piles once and then and then we

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.180 
these piles once and then and then we
use<00:06:59.110> them<00:06:59.350> and<00:06:59.500> then<00:06:59.650> when<00:06:59.800> we<00:06:59.890> make<00:07:00.040> a<00:07:00.070> new

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
use them and then when we make a new

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.630 
use them and then when we make a new
compost<00:07:00.580> pile<00:07:00.910> we<00:07:01.210> inoculate<00:07:01.960> them<00:07:02.140> again<00:07:02.410> and

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
compost pile we inoculate them again and

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.830 
compost pile we inoculate them again and
we've<00:07:03.640> got<00:07:03.790> lots<00:07:03.880> of<00:07:03.970> preparation<00:07:04.210> leftover

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
we've got lots of preparation leftover

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.350 
we've got lots of preparation leftover
so<00:07:05.050> maybe<00:07:05.230> we<00:07:05.380> can<00:07:05.820> you'll<00:07:06.820> bring<00:07:07.000> them<00:07:07.180> to

so maybe we can you'll bring them to

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.990 
so maybe we can you'll bring them to
some<00:07:07.630> some<00:07:08.230> compost<00:07:08.590> piles<00:07:08.920> of<00:07:09.220> our<00:07:09.460> of<00:07:09.820> our

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
some some compost piles of our of our

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.980 
some some compost piles of our of our
