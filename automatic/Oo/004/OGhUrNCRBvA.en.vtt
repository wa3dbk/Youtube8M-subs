00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.359 
other I think he'll be able to see his
youtube<00:01:25.950> video<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.520> he<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> talk<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:28.369> how

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
youtube video and he can talk about how

it's<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.299> been<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.860> big<00:01:31.860> positive<00:01:32.130> step

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's you know been a big positive step

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's you know been a big positive step
and<00:01:32.880> making<00:01:33.689> his<00:01:33.810> class<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.799> think<00:01:35.070> now

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and making his class what we think now

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
and making his class what we think now
is<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.420> best<00:01:36.570> spinning<00:01:37.560> class<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is probably the best spinning class in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.429 
is probably the best spinning class in
America<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.750> don't<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.900> there's<00:01:40.020> any<00:01:40.170> class

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
America I don't think there's any class

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.770 
America I don't think there's any class
that<00:01:40.470> offers<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.430> much<00:01:41.579> value<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.060> Michaels

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that offers as much value as Michaels

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
that offers as much value as Michaels
and<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:44.070> something<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.670> other<00:01:45.360> spinning

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and that's something that other spinning

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
and that's something that other spinning
class<00:01:46.020> instructors<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.040> help<00:01:47.189> will<00:01:47.909> take
