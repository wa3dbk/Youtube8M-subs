00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 I have a city called Lijiang, and fortunately, my mother is very happy. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.730
 That has now received absolute membrane filter so that it's 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.460
 But I keep going to the music for one month to Lijiang

 Now, after a tour in China went to the city of Lijiang is a city wonak

 Mom is gonna submitted gotta expected tomorrow for the first time, for example, said this a thousand lives 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 This word also came to me because I had a hard time. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.500
 There are stories of earlier extensions can be a little worried because the child is really doing 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.789
 It's like everyone in the family. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450
 Parents, my parents are just doing it every day 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.770
 You did it. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.600
 Meanwhile, today or tomorrow, because eventually the same day, no apparent side jilge expected tomorrow 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 Syeotdeon did not have that, so now tell me how do you like the now-woven

 I think I'll be able to go a long journey

 I think that was really the mother enshrined trip to come naneunji You did really well 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 I start to think. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.240
 This time it was only really developed until now, so now the subsequent reversal 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 I'll have that expands 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 Of course, I did not spend much time with my mother, 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.140
 You think you know. 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.250

 I'm just discovered that the new look of the mother 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.310
 For example , if I eat rice, I will surely like my mother. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 If you find the sun and find fried rice or know what kind of noodles are so expensive in Korea

 Will 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:32.190
 Oh , it's a stereotype. I do not think I'm the only one who likes the answer. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.490
