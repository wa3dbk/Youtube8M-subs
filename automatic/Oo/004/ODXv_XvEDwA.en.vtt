00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
effectiveness of a given skill then when

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040 
effectiveness of a given skill then when
you<00:03:09.700> kick<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.120> notch<00:03:10.270> tier<00:03:10.660> 2<00:03:10.840> will

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
you kick it up a notch tier 2 will

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.720 
you kick it up a notch tier 2 will
actually<00:03:11.500> alter<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.920> behavior<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.400> your

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
actually alter the behavior of your

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.610 
actually alter the behavior of your
skills<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.510> example<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.080> base<00:03:14.290> turret

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
skills for example your base turret

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.750 
skills for example your base turret
which<00:03:14.830> would<00:03:15.010> normally<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.340> shoot<00:03:15.610> our

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
which would normally just shoot our

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.940 
which would normally just shoot our
bullets<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:16.690> deal<00:03:16.930> incendiary<00:03:17.470> damage

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
bullets can now deal incendiary damage

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.710 
bullets can now deal incendiary damage
or<00:03:18.490> retaliatory<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.300> could<00:03:19.450> turn<00:03:19.570> your

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
or retaliatory you could turn your

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.000 
or retaliatory you could turn your
seeker<00:03:20.020> mind<00:03:20.230> which<00:03:20.410> rolls<00:03:20.620> along<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.800> ground

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
seeker mind which rolls along the ground

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.800 
seeker mind which rolls along the ground
and<00:03:21.190> chase<00:03:21.280> these<00:03:21.400> enemies<00:03:21.610> into<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.360> bouncing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and chase these enemies into a bouncing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.540 
and chase these enemies into a bouncing
betty<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:23.800> should<00:03:23.950> now<00:03:24.040> begin<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.370> see

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
betty so you should now begin to see

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.130 
betty so you should now begin to see
that<00:03:24.820> midway<00:03:25.240> through<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.510> territory<00:03:25.750> you've

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
that midway through the territory you've

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.480 
that midway through the territory you've
already<00:03:26.260> start<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.590> change<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> behavior<00:03:27.310> of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
already start to change the behavior of

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.030 
already start to change the behavior of
some<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.790> your<00:03:27.910> skills<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:29.080> 43<00:03:29.590> we<00:03:29.860> don't

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
some of your skills then 43 we don't

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.350 
some of your skills then 43 we don't
currently<00:03:30.220> know<00:03:30.400> too<00:03:30.490> much<00:03:30.820> about<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.210> one

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
currently know too much about this one

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.030 
currently know too much about this one
to<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.570> them<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.780> too<00:03:31.870> many<00:03:31.960> examples<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.950> if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
to have them in too many examples but if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.440 
to have them in too many examples but if
you<00:03:33.160> follow<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.520> trend<00:03:33.760> then<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.120> expect

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
you follow the trend then you expect

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.540 
you follow the trend then you expect
them<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.810> something<00:03:35.200> pretty<00:03:35.380> extreme<00:03:35.920> one

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
them to be something pretty extreme one

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.220 
them to be something pretty extreme one
example<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:37.000> have<00:03:37.180> seen<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.630> your<00:03:37.840> tier<00:03:38.020> 2

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
example we have seen is the your tier 2

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.290 
example we have seen is the your tier 2
incendiary<00:03:38.710> turret<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.550> now<00:03:39.790> become<00:03:40.000> a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
incendiary turret can now become a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.480 
incendiary turret can now become a
flamethrower<00:03:40.690> in<00:03:41.080> tier<00:03:41.290> 3<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.160> if<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.340> use

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
flamethrower in tier 3 so if you use

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.340 
flamethrower in tier 3 so if you use
that<00:03:42.520> as<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.820> baseline<00:03:43.120> then<00:03:43.720> imagine<00:03:43.960> what<00:03:44.260> you

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
that as a baseline then imagine what you

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.260 
that as a baseline then imagine what you
could<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.650> your<00:03:44.860> seeker<00:03:45.130> mine<00:03:45.310> what<00:03:46.060> if

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
could do to your seeker mine what if

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.580 
could do to your seeker mine what if
instead<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.810> just<00:03:47.020> rolling<00:03:47.290> around<00:03:47.410> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
instead of just rolling around the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.230 
instead of just rolling around the
ground<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:47.980> chasing<00:03:48.220> your<00:03:48.310> enemies<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.970> could

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
ground and chasing your enemies it could

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.120 
ground and chasing your enemies it could
climb<00:03:49.420> wolves<00:03:49.810> kinda<00:03:50.500> like<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.710> bomb<00:03:50.860> too<00:03:51.040> in

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
climb wolves kinda like the bomb too in

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.310 
climb wolves kinda like the bomb too in

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you throw an item it emits a sound and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.600 
you throw an item it emits a sound and
that<00:04:25.990> draws<00:04:26.170> tog<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.440> nearby<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.100> there's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
that draws tog is nearby and there's

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.890 
that draws tog is nearby and there's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
don't actually know too much about but I

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.500 
don't actually know too much about but I
would<00:04:30.430> imagine<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.940> would<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.060> some<00:04:31.300> sort<00:04:31.420> of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
would imagine it would be some sort of

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.210 
would imagine it would be some sort of
close-range<00:04:31.840> encounter<00:04:32.350> maneuver<00:04:32.680> whereby

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
close-range encounter maneuver whereby

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.680 
close-range encounter maneuver whereby
you<00:04:33.280> deploy<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:33.940> would<00:04:34.060> disperse<00:04:34.390> all

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you deploy it and it would disperse all

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.090 
you deploy it and it would disperse all
days<00:04:34.930> nearby<00:04:35.410> enemies<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.830> give<00:04:35.980> you<00:04:36.040> a

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
days nearby enemies and give you a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.070 
days nearby enemies and give you a
