00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
which looks very cool and also the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
which looks very cool and also the
printing<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> torso<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.500> quite<00:01:35.070> different

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
printing on the torso is quite different

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.240 
printing on the torso is quite different
and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:37.200> really<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> new<00:01:38.009> version

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.999 
and I really really like the new version
but<00:01:39.240> let<00:01:39.390> me<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.600> ahead<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> show<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
but let me go ahead and kind of show you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
but let me go ahead and kind of show you
the<00:01:41.280> difference<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.659> take<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> mask

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the difference if you do take the mask

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
the difference if you do take the mask
pieces<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.850> have

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pieces off because they do have

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.950 
pieces off because they do have
different<00:01:45.479> faces<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.229> new<00:01:46.979> ones<00:01:47.689> or<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
different faces on the new ones or the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010 
different faces on the new ones or the
new<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.939> there's<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.180> difference<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
new one there's the difference in the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
new one there's the difference in the
faces<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> armor

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
faces there you can also see the armor

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.469 
faces there you can also see the armor
of<00:01:54.869> clothes<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> new<00:01:56.969> armor<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of clothes I really like the new armor a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.230 
of clothes I really like the new armor a
lot<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> looks<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.610> cool<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lot I think it looks just so cool and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
lot I think it looks just so cool and
