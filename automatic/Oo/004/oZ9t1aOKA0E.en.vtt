00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.770 
around like a strip of leather and then
yeah<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.500> looks<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
yeah just looks like

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.680 
yeah just looks like
it's<00:01:41.990> really<00:01:42.140> heavy<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.790> was<00:01:44.000> kind<00:01:44.660> of

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
it's really heavy and this was kind of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.020 
it's really heavy and this was kind of
expensive<00:01:45.050> from<00:01:45.470> not<00:01:45.650> less<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.490> figured<00:01:46.940> as

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
expensive from not less but I figured as

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.660 
expensive from not less but I figured as
one<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.180> those<00:01:47.330> pieces<00:01:47.540> were<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:49.520> won't

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
one of those pieces were you won't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.850 
one of those pieces were you won't
really<00:01:49.820> find<00:01:50.090> anywhere<00:01:50.390> else<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:50.870> actually<00:01:51.830> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
really find anywhere else so actually I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
really find anywhere else so actually I
ended<00:01:52.070> up<00:01:52.430> coming<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.910> Urban<00:01:53.210> Outfitters

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.960 
picked up a couple more things and the
first<00:02:02.869> thing<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.260> thought<00:02:03.410> well<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.640> has<00:02:04.940> a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
first thing I thought well is that has a

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.640 
first thing I thought well is that has a
v-neck<00:02:05.300> which<00:02:05.630> I'm<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.900> super<00:02:06.229> stoked<00:02:06.470> about

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
v-neck which I'm not super stoked about

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.550 
v-neck which I'm not super stoked about
but<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.610> started<00:02:07.940> up<00:02:08.060> I'm<00:02:08.570> getting<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.200> it's

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
but it started up I'm getting it it's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.840 
but it started up I'm getting it it's
really<00:02:09.679> light<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.070> flowing<00:02:10.310> -<00:02:10.520> figured<00:02:10.759> it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
really light and flowing - figured it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.790 
really light and flowing - figured it
was<00:02:10.970> good<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.240> just<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.510> casual<00:02:12.170> day<00:02:12.350> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
