00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.259
 we will put ourselves at 0.5 from the edge of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.580
 the pocket 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.150
 I take off my first regular I'm going 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 pass my needle roughly in the middle 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 of my gold the two pocket bones he age of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.300
 leave immediately one last then 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 there you have to go slowly 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:39.470
 because we're going to get out of 1 hop point there 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.470
 now I'm out of a point here 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 at the level of my pocket I'm a point to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.699
 the outside of my pocket here now 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 I will see and go 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.589
 staying at 0.5 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.040
 until then and if I finish with a 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.040
 welcome point 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.300
 we are of course doll is not the word 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.300
 end 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.370
 there I turn very slowly to this is the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.120
 Technical rounded we saw 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.120
 in the first videos 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.540
 so here you may have better the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.579
 see what I did on the other side 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.579
 that is to say that I go to the end 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.069
 here I go out of a point outside of 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.519
 my mouth and I 'm coming back of course 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.519
 sewing 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.040
 and here is my pocket and then sewn 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.650
 now 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 I take it off because I 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.830
 explained earlier under the machine 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.260
 why did I get you out of a 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.240
 pocket point 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.180
 at this level it is to avoid 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.210
 tearing the fabric like that she is 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.100
 maintained and sono dignified and without the pocket 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.100
 now I can do more at my pocket 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.990
 now that I have invented everything 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.690
 take my pocket and I see her go by 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.920
 completely here then if you want so 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.990
 you fancy could redo a 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.460
 sting here I think it was 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.010
 much prettier than hell because 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.220
 that here we made a drawing here 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.220
 the pocket
