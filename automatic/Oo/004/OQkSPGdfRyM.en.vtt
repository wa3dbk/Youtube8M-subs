00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
this simply by doing this I've seen so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.030 
this simply by doing this I've seen so
you've<00:02:46.610> got<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.850> little<00:02:47.060> one<00:02:47.920> what<00:02:48.920> should

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
you've got that little one what should

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.830 
you've got that little one what should
we<00:02:49.100> sort<00:02:49.280> gap<00:02:49.580> there<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.300> simply<00:02:50.480> place

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
we sort gap there that you simply place

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.199 
we sort gap there that you simply place
it<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:55.070> should<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.670> reckon<00:02:55.820> I

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
it and then that should be in I reckon I

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.479 
it and then that should be in I reckon I
reckon<00:02:56.930> that's<00:02:57.080> all<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.590> reckon<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:58.250> ready

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
