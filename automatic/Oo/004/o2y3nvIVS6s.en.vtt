00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.200
 in the 1930s reckless children attacked for the first time I have 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.399
 wheels with pieces of wood 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 they could not even imagine what would happen 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.810
 in 1958 a group of surfers invented the sarfa from the ground 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 transforming wooden structures into boards 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.520
 they spent their time darting through the streets on wooden boards with wheels 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.910
 soon their pastime would become a global phenomenon 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.470
 the board is the part of the skate and on which it rises and is made up of thin layers 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.710
 of wood called players 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.330
 the least expensive boards are in poor quality wood - high quality ones 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 they have 7 maple wood 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.270
 only the upper and lower player are visible for this are 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.969
 smooth 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.969
 while the other side is prepared for the glue 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.920
 the inner layers are covered with glue on both sides 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 the adhesive specifically designed to withstand vibrations 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.630
 away from the times they have it 35 never once the equivalent of 5 tables insert 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 in the mold 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.310
 mariano kickit for sizes and formats 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.310
 for this reason there are different molds 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.440
 one press exerts 40 tons of pressure attacking and abbey curve 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.390
 claisse based on the mold 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.090
 excellent glue still on the sides by compacting the five boards into one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 block that will be separated later 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.060
 the block is completed in 3 hours and then drilled in two points that will be used for 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.260
 mount front and rear notch or rotary axes that allow it 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 skate viral 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.670
 the rectangular block now takes the form of a skateboard depending on the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 model you want to produce 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.919
 in this phase the block is fixed as reference to obtain just fury 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.290
 practiced and sawn 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.290
 leaving a margin of 2 centimeters and a half 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.629
 they are then worked individually this time with greater precision up to 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 get the final product 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.399
 the two ends are rounded with a circular saw 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
 then the surfaces are smoothed with a grinder 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.879
 furon loc on which sandpaper brushes are mounted or elimination of imperfections 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.689
 the table is now perfectly smooth 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:25.809
 now only the finishing is missing the board must be sprayed with one 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.179
 first coat of colorless paint 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:32.349
 in this way the hearts of the Poor Clares are stopped and will not be affected 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.349
 from the lacquering 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.849
 two hours later the paint is dry 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.500
 the boards are then sprayed with colored lacquer 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.230
 a protective finish 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.689
 it's bright 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.689
 even the lacquer takes two hours to dry 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.809
 the final step and the decoration of the table 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:16.400
 the designs are printed on the plastic stela are produced by the company 

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.399
 same. purchased ready-made 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.619
 the design is positioned the table passes under a machine that warms it 

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:30.619
 is the press at the same time 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.220
 p 200 degrees to which the table is brought induce a chemical reaction 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.639
 which blends ink and lacquer 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.530
 just remove the plastic layer and the table is ready 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.139
 it is also possible to buy virgin boards from specialist shops 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.969
 but they are intended for professionals who want to customize their skates 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.020
 you can choose between wheels and bearings and even bolts 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.650
 skate 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.570
 these are the factors that determine the speed and agility of skateboarding 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.130
 his maneuvers
