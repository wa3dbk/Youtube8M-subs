 Hi, If you look for her in the upper part of the iPhone battery appearance 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.450
 It's basically a display of how much battery is left. 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:35.730
 I do not know exactly how much this is. 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 Who'd bet you have any inconvenience or off the balance on a cellphone yen this time 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.540
 Let's learn how to display numbers. 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 Press the sugar button. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.030
 Press the General button again 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.520
 If you put it up a little, you're sick and I saw it wrong. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.710
 4 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.969
 Usage indeyo Ah sorry to use you see, tap the information area 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.590
 The part that says "Remaining battery power" is deactivated. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.780
 When Can I make lightly, click the button shown on the right turn into green 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.140
 You see the numbers going to the top of the visible part of that as long as the battery remains frozen 4 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 It's me that is not confirmed without a 64% and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 Apparently, it looks like a half to a little more, but it is marked by a number. 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 I think it's too good to be able to confirm exactly . 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 4 Now that the KakaoTalk or phone or text is not consuming much battery 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 There are also parts, but those funny apps are consumed faster than the battery 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 It was. 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.280
 It takes a lot of time to charge your cell phone after it is completely discharged. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.320
 Do your battery management efficiently and enjoy your iPhone life 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 I hope 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.300
 So far, the saddle has gotten smart and miles a day. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300
 thank you 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:19.260

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.260
