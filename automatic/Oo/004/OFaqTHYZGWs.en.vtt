00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.599
 talk and listen we're not back with 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 another match that counts from black to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.350
 black ops is a face of this bug in code 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.519
 or if at a bar fly zone there I no longer 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.109
 walks the beige book is a little tip 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.970
 fast this very fast sugar should 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 have at most r 3 thousand if you can see 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 but I just for quick friends and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.010
 can be said of warning but perhaps the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 frequency of videos on the channel 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.719
 decrease slightly missing could 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.030
 post and one or two videos every day 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 but those who follow on twitter saw I 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 I went back to work then I finished 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 in that crazy rush again of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 get up early and go out and sleep early that I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.020
 I get home tired, so I'm 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.020
 recording the video today I'm tired but 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 It's just to let you guys stay there. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.329
 wondering what is going on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 but beauty so is this there from a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.840
 very quick start even making staff 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.420
 I'm falling seven beautiful we're 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 there having fun and playing there are 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 possible to make a case even 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 there I explained in a video there the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 Why can not you see someone with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 Who 's here on this map doing late? 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.290
 of yesterday killed a guy face down and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.750
 enjoy this rap video a lot of people 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.280
 asked me so many squad points is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.710
 because of this every time you make a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.820
 let them leave you ask you to win one 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.740
 platoon point then there understood 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 Police from the points by cover 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 So that's it, man. I think the river of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 January to the cabin he left behind and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.470
 I did not try it was not another minute and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 A little video there, I'll take my man who does the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.340
 tournament got angry thinking he had 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.780
 stolen from him but there the tower proof 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.420
 I did not steal of you know that the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.270
 holiday fell where there right 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 I did not steal so it was mine. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.380
 so do not be mad at it one more time 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.290
 now know that he killed but 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.030
 through its multiple then that's it 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.650
 Only people you see that at the end of the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.990
 video that he is doing almost in 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 It accounts it was as I said is a departure 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.850
 really fast really 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.970
 So that's what I said so much, so that's it. 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.330
 but I'll try to pass every day 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.080
 come home and make videos but not 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.270
 guaranteed 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 I have to schedule myself and make videos 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.050
 at the weekend to comfort in this 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.150
 put in order so that's it folks 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.250
 look for here we are deciding if 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.820
 You want to close for the Lord and that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.550
 favorite 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.340
 then sometimes this is what is there 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.500
