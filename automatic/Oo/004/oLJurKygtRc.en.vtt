do<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.790> do<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:46.330> think<00:01:46.690> on<00:01:46.810> your<00:01:46.840> feet<00:01:46.990> and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
do you do that think on your feet and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.750 
do you do that think on your feet and
add<00:01:47.440> an<00:01:47.590> element<00:01:47.680> into<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.160> program<00:01:48.580> which

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
add an element into a program which

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.610 
add an element into a program which
you've<00:01:48.970> obviously<00:01:49.270> prepared<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.290> set<00:01:50.500> way

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
you've obviously prepared in a set way

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.310 
you've obviously prepared in a set way
for<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.010> long<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.420> know<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:52.720> something<00:01:52.930> that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
for so long you know it's something that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.980 
for so long you know it's something that
you<00:01:53.680> practice<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:55.090> guess<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.510> practice

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
you practice I guess in practice

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.170 
you practice I guess in practice
sometimes<00:01:56.470> if<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.040> make<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> mistake<00:01:57.790> like

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
sometimes if you make a mistake like

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780 
sometimes if you make a mistake like
that<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.080> training<00:01:59.500> run<00:01:59.680> through<00:02:00.190> then<00:02:00.430> you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
that on a training run through then you

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.120 
that on a training run through then you
know

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
know

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.429 
know
you<00:02:01.159> have<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.939> act<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.289> in

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
you have you have to act like it's in

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.319 
you have you have to act like it's in
competition<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.520> go<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:05.149> do

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
competition and then you go and you do

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.440 
competition and then you go and you do
the<00:02:05.450> combination<00:02:06.140> on<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.890> next<00:02:07.219> jump<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.820> you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the combination on the next jump and you

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.180 
the combination on the next jump and you
know<00:02:08.539> it's<00:02:08.720> something<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.289> I've<00:02:09.440> done<00:02:09.890> a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
know it's something that I've done a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.820 
know it's something that I've done a
couple<00:02:10.280> times<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.360> season<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:11.959> practice<00:02:12.530> but

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
couple times the season in practice but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.180 
couple times the season in practice but
not<00:02:13.130> too<00:02:13.310> often<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
not too often and you just have to you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.240 
not too often and you just have to you
know<00:02:16.280> remember<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.970> keep<00:02:17.209> thinking<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.250> you

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
know remember to keep thinking and you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.620 
know remember to keep thinking and you
know<00:02:19.280> stay<00:02:19.580> confident<00:02:20.060> for<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.300> rest<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
know stay confident for the rest of the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.020 
know stay confident for the rest of the
performance<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.980> into<00:02:22.340> Worlds<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.790> think

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
performance going into Worlds I think

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.670 
performance going into Worlds I think
more<00:02:23.209> or<00:02:23.300> less<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.599> programs<00:02:24.050> will<00:02:24.380> stay

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
more or less the programs will stay

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.550 
more or less the programs will stay
about<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.040> same<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.730> might<00:02:26.170> switch<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.410> an

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
about the same we might switch out an

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410 
about the same we might switch out an
element<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.040> two<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> short<00:02:28.700> program<00:02:28.880> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
element or two in the short program to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.949 
element or two in the short program to
make<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.650> more<00:02:30.769> difficult<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:31.959> you

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
make it a little more difficult but you

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.979 
make it a little more difficult but you
know<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:33.050> keep<00:02:33.440> running<00:02:33.920> programs<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.209> keep

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
know just keep running programs and keep

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.309 
know just keep running programs and keep
everything<00:02:36.410> going<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.519> way<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.390> keep

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
everything going the way it is and keep

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.250 
everything going the way it is and keep

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
Olympics what would you do um I'd have

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.770 
Olympics what would you do um I'd have
never<00:03:06.350> snowboarded<00:03:06.799> before<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.150> love

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
never snowboarded before but I love

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.599 
never snowboarded before but I love
watching<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.290> halfpipe<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.040> some<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609

watching the halfpipe and some of the
snowboard<00:03:11.030> events<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.870> looks<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.380> a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
snowboard events and that looks like a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.010 
snowboard events and that looks like a
lot<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.709> funds
