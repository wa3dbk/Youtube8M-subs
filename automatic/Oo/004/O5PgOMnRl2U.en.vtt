00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.760
 Greeting. My name is Tomasz Piotrowski 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.020
 I work for CarLabImmo 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.600
 I want to introduce you a new Bypass Gold Edition product. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:34.520
 Bypass Gold Edition is the only one of its kind that deactivates Immo on VAG vehicles via OBD. 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:43.219
 It is intended for diesel and petrol driven vehicles equipped with EDC16, ME7, EDC15 engine computers. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.580
 Now I'll tell you how the device works. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.340
 After you open the vehicle door, turn on the contact. 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.660
 While the key in the contact position, wait 20 seconds. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.600
 Next, turn on the OBD device. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 From the moment you turn on the device, it automatically detects which vehicle you are connecting to 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.400
 and determines if diesel or gasoline is a computer engine. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.880
 After successful recognition, it establishes communication with the computer and removes immo. 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.440
 When the immo is removed, the device also checks the procedure for proper execution. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.080
 The device has a 3-step function. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.440
 First, engine computer identification. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.900
 Secondly, it establishes communication with the computer and removes immo blockage. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.960
 Third, confirms that the removal procedure was correct. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.020
 The whole procedure lasts between 1 and 2 minutes. 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:17.280
 Immediately after removing immo, the diode flashes on the unit 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.480
 At that point, you can be sure that the lock is removed. 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:41.500
 Each Bypass Gold Edition device has its own unique serial number, which CarLabImmo keeps records.
