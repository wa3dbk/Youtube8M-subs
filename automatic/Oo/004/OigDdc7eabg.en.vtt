00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.849
 the celestial one of the specialties of the many that I have that is the doe 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.570
 when doing a good tour you will have two options compels to buy to the market 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.800
 after what he has done and although this morning 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
 but also to the hotel beach and found all these areas 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 I've been a bit of rock discs some stairs 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.140
 it goes through cold death the carrots a few onions benefited 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.400
 the tomatoes 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.710
 he could also deviate from clear beach because up we are standing 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.080
 I wanted some branches that are operating so far is what we have 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.620
 in front 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.660
 lassad and obviously the party is going to say to the pines 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.650
 other parties said 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.710
 ohio where you can not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.100
 the paellas 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 from the signature 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 the barrier in which he has given us 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.900
 and yesterday they had to attend live to heaven 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 everything will be win have impact 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.260
 of disaster 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.480
 first step to make one and will not have some executor hands to have 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 helping out there we have who is scratching the tomato 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.870
 here we have a substitute on the bench so that at any time 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.870
 we can do things and that allows you this 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.180
 take the glass of wine and I come from home after the truce 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.440
 so the first step of the basic train of the future because if it is not going to take 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 Much more 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.780
 and we put in preparing the summit there we can 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.479
 the fisherman previously recorded in the aforementioned place fishing in those things 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.650
 and dozens of injured 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 we will tell you 19 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 carrot 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.350
 xinhua awareness procedures 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.939
 and parents find out 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 preferably olive 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.550
 and all this we want to serve as a 25 minutes ideal time to take the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.549
 wine glass to modify it 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.819
 while the young man follows his course and the sister daniela peeling onions that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.719
 have any drama that is leading poverty 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.339
 is giving us the cristina we are going to give a touch of color to the 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.649
 noodles so the first thing we have done is innocuous abundant oil 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.559
 olive inside the pan let's put to play 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 Be careful not to splash 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.769
 and we will go to put down sticks have been caught a little color and not allowed 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.239
 that burn because it would leave bad taste we will put the noodles lady gaga 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.629
 we will look in the eyes we will remove the contributions of the floor here before yes 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.939
 obviously because if you do not burn the garlic and put the Pyrenees percent and 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.769
 the canons of healthy diet explain us that they are about three thousand 873 noodles 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.889
 exactly the ones that you change to put 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.099
 efe so we'll do a little elbows fists per person 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.439
 we have already put the videos, it is time to remove them well so that everyone 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.639
 divide by the same heat of the arts 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.859
 we do not have any more facts other facts 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.789
 so we've done it on someone who has graces later breaking the 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.269
 Jews 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.739
 as you see the financiers have taken the color we wanted to be colored 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.439
 Toasties was the time to remove them crazy we will do it so that they lose a little 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.849
 of the oil that are not all that we have put because we have put more 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.329
 of what we need for this and we will use this oil to make a 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.459
 sofrito comes the moment that we begin to place the things that already 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.549
 they will remain in the fideuá we have strained the noodles we have taken advantage of the oil that 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.250
 In addition to having that flavor we have selected the part we need in 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.599
 amount if we put the droughts the first thing we are going to do is going to be easy 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 this drought as month we are working with fire forces 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.189
 one of the pathological findings we will continue adding the following appointment 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.189
 elements 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.989
 of the heras is taking color zitarrosa and what we want is the 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.989
 ladies' moment 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.019
 here the branches and the droughts and the orchestras we add the onion 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.939
 and we remove it 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.939
 semester you meet new friendships 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.940
 It is not time to put the tomato previously grated 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.699
 chopped hites 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.039
 a little bit of baking to remove the acidity always as it says it's going to 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.039
 play poorly made carbon better 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.620
 in the stadium there is nahda 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.749
 for March 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.949
 was the table to a Swedish Nobel prize that I know to explain why 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.429
 this of the bicarbonate and the sugar and the solution is quite simple the sugar does not 

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:03.189
 disguises the fide while the bicarbonate what it does is eliminate it 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.249
 much better to eliminate it 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.360
 we have added sanz since we are 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 stirring a little so that everything tastes 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.379
 the time comes for almost the entire city 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.229
 we have all this hot add the noodles 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.180
 it was before we got your foja in this forum james amos oz 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.809
 if the fumet that we have been preparing 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.859
 with the galleys the rock fish the carrot the parsley 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.749
 obviously we will use a colander so that we do not fall 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.389
 nothing inside the city 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.389
 if we stick to throwing cold water in which cover all the creeds 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.669
 We will promote a little for your recreation of the first acts of 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:53.689
 Water 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.930
 and we'll go straight to the oven 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.020
 to get the noodles that in the tip and evaporates water intakes 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.860
 on the other side we have a rafa that is not preparing a fantastic 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.689
 violence if someone does not know how to make that plane and to complement 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.250
 the fideuá to review the videos of the kitchen tv take into account 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.330
 It has been between 3 and 5 minutes as you see the water has completely evaporated 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.550
 the videos are on edge is the perfect time to get them out 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.610
 Be careful not to burn the leftover citation agreements when traveling fast here 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.389
 thrown 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.270
 disney co so he took advantage 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.340
 so it's time to serve we put a few tablespoons of 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.339
 fideuá on the set 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.179
 recommended that you do not know much because the normal thing is that people want to repeat 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.779
 so it's better that it does not end 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.279
 and this we will accompany 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.110
