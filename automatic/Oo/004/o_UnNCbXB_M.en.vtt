we've used are in place and by the way

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.660 
we've used are in place and by the way
we'll<00:02:43.569> put<00:02:43.750> shims<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.170> each<00:02:44.380> hinge<00:02:45.100> point

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
we'll put shims in each hinge point

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.309 
we'll put shims in each hinge point
basically<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.300> behind<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.690> hinges<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
basically right behind the hinges and

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.140 
basically right behind the hinges and
then<00:02:48.010> what<00:02:48.220> we'll<00:02:48.400> do<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.640> nail<00:02:49.600> or<00:02:49.930> fasten<00:02:51.150> in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
then what we'll do is nail or fasten in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.400 
then what we'll do is nail or fasten in

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.720 

we'll<00:02:59.410> do<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.769> each<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> three<00:03:00.489> hinge

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
we'll do that on each of the three hinge

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.880 
we'll do that on each of the three hinge
spots<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:01.209> once<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.600> side<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.989> level<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
spots now once this side is level the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.520 
spots now once this side is level the
door<00:03:03.130> will<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.310> somewhat<00:03:03.910> secure<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.290> we

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
door will be somewhat secure and so we

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.560 
door will be somewhat secure and so we
can<00:03:05.709> test<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.310> fit<00:03:06.549> all<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.790> our<00:03:06.970> gaps<00:03:07.239> and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
can test and fit all of our gaps and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.740 
can test and fit all of our gaps and
then<00:03:07.959> what<00:03:08.140> we'll<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:09.090> level<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.450> side

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
then what we'll do is level this side

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.080 
then what we'll do is level this side
put<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.380> our<00:03:11.530> shims<00:03:11.799> in<00:03:11.950> three<00:03:12.220> spots<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
put in our shims in three spots and

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.670 
put in our shims in three spots and
secure<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.989> our<00:03:14.200> bar<00:03:14.380> will<00:03:14.530> basically

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
secure that and our bar will basically

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.630
