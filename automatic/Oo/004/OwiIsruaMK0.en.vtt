00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.400 
her it was just probably some of the
best<00:01:50.350> memories<00:01:50.830> I've<00:01:51.340> had<00:01:52.000> today<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.630> now<00:01:53.080> have

best memories I've had today I now have
this<00:01:53.530> new<00:01:53.740> benchmark<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.840> professional

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
this new benchmark of what professional

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.500 
this new benchmark of what professional
employment<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.850> guess<00:01:58.300> what<00:01:58.480> a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
employment but it's I guess what a

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.080 
employment but it's I guess what a
supermodel<00:01:59.050> is<00:01:59.350> she<00:01:59.620> already<00:02:00.340> knows<00:02:00.610> longer<00:02:01.060> I
