00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
these curls to hold in place you really

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
these curls to hold in place you really
want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> hold<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> around<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> wand<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
want to hold it around the wand for a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.950 
want to hold it around the wand for a
good<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.619> least<00:01:34.920> 20<00:01:35.400> seconds<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> feel

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
good at least 20 seconds I like to feel

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
good at least 20 seconds I like to feel
through<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> curl<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.030> feel

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
through the curl and see once they feel

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.960 
through the curl and see once they feel
hot<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> let<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.250> release

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
hot and that's when I let them release

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.810 
hot and that's when I let them release
and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.189> over<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960 
and then I just do that all over just
taking<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> big<00:01:45.570> chunks<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.290> hair<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> want

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to make sure you're just holding it in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.109

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.660 
this beachy look for this hairspray
again<00:03:10.020> I'm<00:03:10.200> going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.740> using<00:03:10.860> The<00:03:11.160> Rave<00:03:11.370> but

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
again I'm going to be using The Rave but

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.699 
again I'm going to be using The Rave but
this<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> four<00:03:12.360> times<00:03:12.660> mega<00:03:13.080> hairspray

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
this is the four times mega hairspray

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.610 
this is the four times mega hairspray
and<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.520> aerosol<00:03:15.150> version<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.560> is

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and it's the aerosol version and this is

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.070 
and it's the aerosol version and this is
great<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.910> has<00:03:18.090> climate<00:03:18.660> shield<00:03:18.870> in

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
great because it has climate shield in

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.930 
great because it has climate shield in
it<00:03:19.200> all<00:03:19.350> their<00:03:19.560> hairspray<00:03:20.010> does<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it all their hairspray does and it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.120 
it all their hairspray does and it
really<00:03:21.239> helps<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.320> prevent<00:03:22.739> against

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
really helps just like prevent against

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.130 
really helps just like prevent against
humidity<00:03:23.430> which<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.269> what<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.900> with

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
humidity which is what I think of with

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.250 
humidity which is what I think of with
these<00:03:25.290> curls<00:03:25.709> kind<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.370> beachy<00:03:26.790> theme

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
these curls kind of like a beachy theme

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.300 
these curls kind of like a beachy theme
so<00:03:28.260> then<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.709> hairspray<00:03:29.160> each

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
so then I'm going to hairspray each

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.160 
so then I'm going to hairspray each
layer<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.910> then<00:03:30.060> I'm<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.269> curling<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.959> top

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
layer and then I'm just curling the top

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.910 
layer and then I'm just curling the top
doing<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> same<00:03:32.040> thing<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.850> did<00:03:33.030> before

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
doing the same thing that I did before

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
doing the same thing that I did before
so<00:03:34.920> just<00:03:35.130> leaving<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> ends<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.300> just

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
so just leaving the ends out and just

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.750 
so just leaving the ends out and just
not<00:03:36.690> holding<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.290> curl<00:03:37.500> too<00:03:37.920> long<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.519> so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
not holding the curl too long just so

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.940 
not holding the curl too long just so
they<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.570> wave<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.110> not<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:40.769> much

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
they get more of a wave and not so much

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.580 
they get more of a wave and not so much
of<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.190> curl<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.150> I'm<00:03:42.269> going<00:03:42.570> back<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.050> hair

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
