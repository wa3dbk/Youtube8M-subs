Edward would like to know if it is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
Edward would like to know if it is
really<00:00:46.860> possible<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.579> use<00:00:47.760> reverse<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.750> aging

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
really possible to use reverse the aging

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.580 
really possible to use reverse the aging
process<00:00:50.000> naturally<00:00:51.289> specifically<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.469> would

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
process naturally specifically you would

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.229 
process naturally specifically you would
like<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> reduce<00:00:53.039> his<00:00:53.370> risk<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.730> dying<00:00:54.000> of

like to reduce his risk of dying of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
like to reduce his risk of dying of
preventable<00:00:54.780> diseases<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.440> heart<00:00:55.649> disease

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800

and<00:00:56.160> cancer<00:00:56.219> he<00:00:56.910> also<00:00:57.059> wants<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> stay<00:00:57.719> active

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and cancer he also wants to stay active

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.340 
and cancer he also wants to stay active
for<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.770> long<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:58.920> possible<00:00:59.239> well<00:01:00.239> Edward<00:01:01.140> got

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
for as long as possible well Edward got

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.219 
for as long as possible well Edward got
some<00:01:01.559> lofty<00:01:01.920> goals<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.809> share<00:01:03.809> some<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> these

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
some lofty goals I share some of these

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.100 
some lofty goals I share some of these
goals<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.850> let's<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.150> talk<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
goals so let's first talk about this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
goals so let's first talk about this
reversing<00:01:07.710> aging<00:01:07.920> concept<00:01:08.580> obviously

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
reversing aging concept obviously

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.480 
reversing aging concept obviously
there's<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> biological<00:01:10.650> age<00:01:10.860> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's you know a biological age can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
there's you know a biological age can
emerge<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.909> chronological<00:01:12.630> age<00:01:13.170> or

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
emerge a chronological age or

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649 
emerge a chronological age or
chronological<00:01:14.100> HR<00:01:14.430> agent<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.030> years<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
chronological HR agent in years so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
chronological HR agent in years so
you're<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> reverse<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.470> you're

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you're not going to reverse that you're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
you're not going to reverse that you're
here<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.490> certain<00:01:17.790> amount<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.150> time<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
here for certain amount of time and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.999 
here for certain amount of time and
that's<00:01:18.689> added<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> Nets<00:01:19.530> than

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that's added on the Nets than

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
that's added on the Nets than
gerontological<00:01:20.580> age<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.780> reverse

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
gerontological age we can reverse

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
gerontological age we can reverse
certain<00:01:22.470> aspects<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> biological<00:01:23.310> age<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
certain aspects of a biological age so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.149 
certain aspects of a biological age so
for<00:01:24.390> example<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.900> loss<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.380> flexibility<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
for example if loss of flexibility is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100 
for example if loss of flexibility is
associated<00:01:26.580> aging<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.930> could

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
associated aging we know we could

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.390 
associated aging we know we could
stretch<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.710> things<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> improve<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
stretch and do things to improve a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.179 
stretch and do things to improve a
flexibility<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:31.470> case<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.009> can

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
flexibility so in that that case we can

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
flexibility so in that that case we can
reverse<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.520> aspect<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> aging<00:01:33.600> aging<00:01:33.780> may

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
reverse that aspect of aging aging may

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
reverse that aspect of aging aging may
be<00:01:34.409> associated<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.220> certain<00:01:35.700> amount<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
be associated with certain amount of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
be associated with certain amount of
mental<00:01:36.299> decline<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:37.079> loss<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.560> strength<00:01:37.890> well

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mental decline or loss of strength well

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
mental decline or loss of strength well
we<00:01:38.670> could<00:01:38.880> exercise<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> gain<00:01:39.840> strength<00:01:40.170> back

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we could exercise and gain strength back

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.580 
we could exercise and gain strength back
we<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:42.210> mental<00:01:42.720> exercises<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
we can do mental exercises that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
we can do mental exercises that
crossword<00:01:44.100> puzzles<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.670> example<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.270> can

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
crossword puzzles for example we can

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.340 
crossword puzzles for example we can
become<00:01:46.020> sharper<00:01:46.530> math<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.250> sort<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> thing<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
become sharper math that sort of thing a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
become sharper math that sort of thing a
cholesterol<00:01:49.350> might<00:01:49.560> increase<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.460> all<00:01:50.970> these

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
cholesterol might increase and all these

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
cholesterol might increase and all these
different<00:01:51.750> aging<00:01:52.500> markers<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.460> potentially

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
different aging markers are potentially

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840 
different aging markers are potentially
reversible<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.049> biologically<00:01:55.710> yes<00:01:56.070> there's<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
reversible so biologically yes there's a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.130 
reversible so biologically yes there's a

can<00:02:22.830> improve<00:02:23.130> many<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.790> these<00:02:23.910> biological

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
can improve many of these biological

then<00:02:32.190> let's<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.540> Edward<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> also<00:02:33.960> asking<00:02:34.500> he

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
then let's see Edward is also asking he

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.100 
then let's see Edward is also asking he
like<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.820> how<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> reduce<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> risk<00:02:37.020> of

like to know how to reduce the risk of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.450 
like to know how to reduce the risk of
dying<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.470> preventable<00:02:37.830> diseases<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:38.310> heart

dying of preventable diseases like heart
sees<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.820> cancer<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.570> we<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.290> measure

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
sees and cancer so we would measure

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.210 
sees and cancer so we would measure
through<00:02:41.490> our<00:02:41.610> blood<00:02:42.270> detective<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:43.560> take<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
through our blood detective in take a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.540 
through our blood detective in take a
variety<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.210> tests<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.920> something

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
variety of tests that like something

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.130 
variety of tests that like something
called<00:02:47.700> c-reactive<00:02:48.000> protein<00:02:48.420> and

lipid panels known as vat panels these

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.300 
lipid panels known as vat panels these
just<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> few<00:02:54.570> examples<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.200> many<00:02:55.380> tests<00:02:56.160> that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
just a few examples of a many tests that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.880 
just a few examples of a many tests that
we<00:02:56.430> would<00:02:56.580> use<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.060> let<00:02:57.630> us<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.990> if<00:02:58.290> our

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
we would use that let us know if our

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.010 
we would use that let us know if our
dietary<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.760> lifestyle<00:03:00.240> approaches<00:03:00.810> are

dietary and lifestyle approaches are

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.860 
dietary and lifestyle approaches are
working<00:03:01.950> now<00:03:02.400> meaning<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.450> any<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.750> those

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
working now meaning if any of those

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.480 
working now meaning if any of those
tests<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.380> others<00:03:04.680> were<00:03:04.830> abnormal<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
tests or others were abnormal and

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.030 
tests or others were abnormal and
they're<00:03:05.610> becoming<00:03:06.390> normal<00:03:07.290> than<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:07.950> know

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
they're becoming normal than we know

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130 
they're becoming normal than we know
it's<00:03:08.190> working<00:03:08.520> now<00:03:08.550> but<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.390> other<00:03:09.660> benefit

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's working now but the other benefit

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.380 
it's working now but the other benefit
of<00:03:10.320> normalizing<00:03:11.040> biomarkers<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.240> by

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
of normalizing biomarkers is that by

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.330 
of normalizing biomarkers is that by
definition<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:13.380> let<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.680> know<00:03:13.830> how<00:03:14.190> things

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
definition they let you know how things

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.150 
definition they let you know how things
are<00:03:14.490> working<00:03:14.550> now<00:03:14.760> as<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.090> said<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.810> they<00:03:15.930> also

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
are working now as I said but they also

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.250 
are working now as I said but they also
predict<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:18.330> someone<00:03:18.720> who<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:18.870> reduced

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
predict that someone who have reduced

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.470 
predict that someone who have reduced
morbidity<00:03:19.710> mortality<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.520> future<00:03:21.060> as

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
morbidity mortality in the future as

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.180 
morbidity mortality in the future as
long<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.930> keep<00:03:22.200> these<00:03:22.440> tests<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.100> all

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
long as I keep these tests in and all

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.090 
long as I keep these tests in and all
range<00:03:23.580> okay<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:25.410> example<00:03:25.470> high

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
range okay so for example high

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.370 
range okay so for example high
cholesterol<00:03:26.460> we<00:03:26.850> know<00:03:27.060> increases<00:03:27.720> one's<00:03:28.020> risk

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
cholesterol we know increases one's risk

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.780 
cholesterol we know increases one's risk
of<00:03:28.530> dying<00:03:28.740> prematurely<00:03:28.950> from<00:03:29.460> cardiovascular

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of dying prematurely from cardiovascular

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.660 
of dying prematurely from cardiovascular
disease<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.990> but<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.830> person<00:03:32.160> may<00:03:32.220> not<00:03:32.400> feel

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
disease so but a person may not feel

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.400 
disease so but a person may not feel
high<00:03:32.910> cholesterol<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> cancers<00:03:34.170> go<00:03:34.290> by

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
high cholesterol so the cancers go by

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.410 
high cholesterol so the cancers go by
how<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.530> feel<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:35.790> lower<00:03:36.090> cholesterol

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
how we feel but if we lower cholesterol

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.780 
how we feel but if we lower cholesterol
we<00:03:36.900> know<00:03:37.230> we've<00:03:37.500> reduced<00:03:37.650> one's<00:03:38.190> future<00:03:38.400> risk

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
we know we've reduced one's future risk

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.300 
we know we've reduced one's future risk
but<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.300> feel<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> same<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.590> some<00:03:41.070> biomarkers

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
but we feel the same so some biomarkers

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.760 
but we feel the same so some biomarkers
you'll<00:03:42.000> improve<00:03:42.330> improve<00:03:43.110> them<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
you'll improve improve them and you

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.860 
you'll improve improve them and you
might<00:03:43.950> feel<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.220> same<00:03:44.550> but<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.240> know<00:03:45.570> that

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
might feel the same but we know that

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.449 
might feel the same but we know that
each<00:03:46.020> of<00:03:46.170> them<00:03:46.260> carries<00:03:46.590> their<00:03:46.740> statistical

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
each of them carries their statistical

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.449 
each of them carries their statistical
advantage<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.990> terms<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.380> improving<00:03:50.100> how<00:03:50.400> we

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
advantage in terms of improving how we

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.810 
advantage in terms of improving how we
age<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.020> longevity<00:03:52.820> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
age so really this is longevity the

medicine<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.390> anti<00:03:54.870> age<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.410> bit

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
medicine not anti age and that's a bit

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.830 
medicine not anti age and that's a bit
of<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.890> misnomer<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.490> can't<00:03:56.760> show<00:03:56.880> not<00:03:57.120> age<00:03:57.390> at

many<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.940> diseases<00:04:15.209> people<00:04:15.959> are<00:04:16.380> living

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
many of the diseases people are living

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.440 
many of the diseases people are living
longer<00:04:16.830> these<00:04:17.250> days<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:18.030> they're<00:04:18.209> living

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
longer these days but they're living

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.659 
longer these days but they're living
longer<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.989> multiple<00:04:19.650> diseases<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.370> a

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
longer with multiple diseases in a

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.039 
longer with multiple diseases in a
medicine<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.180> wonderful<00:04:21.540> word<00:04:21.690> for<00:04:21.960> it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
medicine have a wonderful word for it

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.270 
medicine have a wonderful word for it
they<00:04:22.169> call<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.770> term

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
they call it the term

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.879 
they call it the term
call<00:04:23.430> disease<00:04:23.760> clusters<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.080> we<00:04:25.500> can<00:04:25.680> show

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
call disease clusters so we can show

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.379 
call disease clusters so we can show
that<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:26.100> statistics<00:04:26.760> yes<00:04:27.000> we're<00:04:27.180> living

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
that a statistics yes we're living

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.150 
that a statistics yes we're living
longer<00:04:27.570> we're<00:04:28.050> not<00:04:28.170> living<00:04:28.320> longer<00:04:28.650> longer

longer we're not living longer longer

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.909 
longer we're not living longer longer
well<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.750> if<00:04:30.990> you're<00:04:31.200> living<00:04:31.440> with<00:04:31.680> this

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
well so if you're living with this

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.250 
well so if you're living with this
infraction<00:04:32.850> throughout<00:04:33.450> all<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.720> these

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
infraction throughout all of these

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.990 
infraction throughout all of these
that's<00:04:34.440> right<00:04:34.650> dis<00:04:34.980> ease<00:04:35.280> as<00:04:35.460> opposed<00:04:35.760> to

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
that's right dis ease as opposed to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.450 
that's right dis ease as opposed to
disease<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.290> play<00:04:37.680> on<00:04:37.830> words<00:04:37.860> that's<00:04:38.250> very

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
disease so a play on words that's very

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.440 
disease so a play on words that's very
important<00:04:38.850> because<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:39.180> know<00:04:39.270> there's

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
important because you know there's

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.760 
important because you know there's
health<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.840> one<00:04:39.960> end<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.230> spectrum<00:04:40.350> and

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
health on one end of the spectrum and

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.500 
health on one end of the spectrum and
there's<00:04:40.919> disease<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:41.910> then<00:04:42.030> there's<00:04:42.210> dis

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
there's disease but then there's dis

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.180 
there's disease but then there's dis
ease<00:04:42.750> in<00:04:42.960> those<00:04:43.080> shades<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.680> grey<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.130> be

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
ease in those shades of grey and be

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.920 
ease in those shades of grey and be
doing<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.700> want<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:44.970> obviously<00:04:45.120> go<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:45.690> way

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
doing we want to obviously go this way

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.379 
doing we want to obviously go this way
so<00:04:46.440> as<00:04:46.740> many<00:04:46.980> biomarkers<00:04:47.580> as<00:04:47.730> we<00:04:47.880> can<00:04:48.060> improve

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
so as many biomarkers as we can improve

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.450 
so as many biomarkers as we can improve
so<00:04:48.990> throughout<00:04:49.320> all<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.860> series<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
so throughout all in the series of the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.980 
so throughout all in the series of the
videos<00:04:50.790> we<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.150> all<00:04:51.360> kinds<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.810> strategies

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
videos we have all kinds of strategies

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.659 
videos we have all kinds of strategies
for<00:04:52.500> improving<00:04:52.680> our<00:04:52.919> health<00:04:52.950> well-being<00:04:53.310> and

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
for improving our health well-being and

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.570 
for improving our health well-being and
then<00:04:54.090> we<00:04:54.360> have<00:04:54.510> our<00:04:54.720> blood<00:04:55.500> detective<00:04:55.950> in<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
then we have our blood detective in the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.820 
then we have our blood detective in the
sort<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.480> description<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:58.260> our<00:04:58.440> general

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
sort of description of our general

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.290 
sort of description of our general
approach<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.640> homepage<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.150> our<00:05:00.240> website

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
approach on the homepage of our website

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.510 
approach on the homepage of our website
that<00:05:00.960> lets<00:05:01.140> people<00:05:01.290> know<00:05:01.470> what<00:05:01.860> our<00:05:01.890> program

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
that lets people know what our program

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.550 
that lets people know what our program
includes<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.660> it's<00:05:03.810> got<00:05:03.930> some<00:05:04.110> basic<00:05:04.530> things

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
includes so it's got some basic things

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.860 
includes so it's got some basic things
described<00:05:05.370> there<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:06.120> then<00:05:06.240> again<00:05:06.390> depending

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
described there but then again depending

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.780 
described there but then again depending
on<00:05:06.960> one's<00:05:07.110> particular<00:05:07.770> health<00:05:08.130> goals<00:05:08.400> like<00:05:08.640> it

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
on one's particular health goals like it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.820 
on one's particular health goals like it
you<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.060> Edward<00:05:09.390> Edwards<00:05:09.930> case<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.650> might

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
you know Edward Edwards case we might

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.430 
you know Edward Edwards case we might
develop<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.910> different<00:05:12.419> biomarker<00:05:12.960> plan<00:05:13.200> of

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
develop a different biomarker plan of

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.860 
develop a different biomarker plan of
testing<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.040> then<00:05:14.520> therefore

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
testing and then therefore

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.180 
testing and then therefore
recommendations<00:05:15.870> based<00:05:16.380> on<00:05:16.650> whether<00:05:16.800> we're

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
recommendations based on whether we're

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.680 
recommendations based on whether we're
talking<00:05:17.340> about<00:05:17.580> his<00:05:17.850> concerns<00:05:18.090> or<00:05:18.479> heart

psoriasis<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.090> memory<00:05:21.479> we<00:05:21.990> might<00:05:22.169> have<00:05:22.350> a

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
psoriasis and memory we might have a

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.020 
psoriasis and memory we might have a
different<00:05:22.710> set<00:05:23.010> of<00:05:23.130> biomarkers<00:05:23.580> on<00:05:23.700> top<00:05:23.880> of
