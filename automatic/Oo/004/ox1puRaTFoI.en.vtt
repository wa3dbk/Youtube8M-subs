your picture bureau if you blades is

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
it's more or less zero so if you're a in

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.119 
it's more or less zero so if you're a in
a<00:03:11.280> potential<00:03:12.209> crash<00:03:12.450> situation<00:03:12.719> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.859> you

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
a potential crash situation you can you

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.240 
a potential crash situation you can you
can<00:03:14.989> close<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.109> throttle<00:03:16.290> down<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.889> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
can close the throttle down and the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.449 
can close the throttle down and the
pitch<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.669> braze<00:03:17.909> is<00:03:18.209> virtually<00:03:18.750> zero<00:03:19.459> so

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
pitch the braze is virtually zero so

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.229 
pitch the braze is virtually zero so
