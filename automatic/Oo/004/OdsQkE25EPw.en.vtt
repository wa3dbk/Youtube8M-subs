00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.149 

now<00:01:52.930> how<00:01:53.530> do<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.860> use<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.420> set<00:01:55.600> up<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.930> dish

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
now how do we use it to set up the dish

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.179 
now how do we use it to set up the dish
first<00:01:57.159> of<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.700> need<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.000> know<00:01:58.509> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
first of all you need to know a

satellite Telstar 12 and I know the
receiving<00:02:10.269> frequency<00:02:10.899> because<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.290> looked<00:02:11.620> it

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
receiving frequency because I looked it

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.460 
receiving frequency because I looked it
up<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.099> internet<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.790> all<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.110> do

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
up on the internet and all I have to do

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.290 
up on the internet and all I have to do
is<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.920> deduct<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.610> local<00:02:16.150> oscillator

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
is to deduct the local oscillator

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.479 
is to deduct the local oscillator
frequency<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.890> lnb<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.800> printed

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
frequency of the lnb which is printed

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.920 
frequency of the lnb which is printed
here<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.300> sticker<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.700> nine<00:02:25.510> point

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
here on the sticker it's nine point

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.110 
here on the sticker it's nine point
seven<00:02:26.200> five<00:02:26.530> gigahertz<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.850> deduct

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
seven five gigahertz you have to deduct

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.059 
seven five gigahertz you have to deduct
that<00:02:28.360> from<00:02:28.420> your<00:02:28.840> desired<00:02:29.410> receiving

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that from your desired receiving

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.039 
that from your desired receiving
frequency<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.019> then<00:02:32.019> set<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.709> resulting

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
frequency and then set up the resulting

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.410 
frequency and then set up the resulting
intermediate<00:02:35.049> frequency<00:02:35.680> here<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.069> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
intermediate frequency here in the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
intermediate frequency here in the
reception<00:02:37.420> window<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.130> all<00:02:39.400> we<00:02:39.580> need<00:02:39.760> to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
reception window so now all we need to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.039 
reception window so now all we need to
do<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:42.780> move<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.049> dish<00:02:44.260> around<00:02:45.870> until<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
do is to move the dish around until the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.660 
do is to move the dish around until the
signal<00:02:47.260> picks<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:49.590> let's<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.799> if<00:02:51.069> we<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.459> get

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
signal picks up let's see if we can get

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.570 
signal picks up let's see if we can get
it<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.970> signal<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.769> preset<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
it a signal here I have preset the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.250 
it a signal here I have preset the
elevation<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.769> an<00:02:56.890> angle<00:02:58.079> corresponding<00:02:59.079> to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
elevation to an angle corresponding to

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.930 
elevation to an angle corresponding to
the<00:02:59.380> satellite<00:02:59.829> I<00:02:59.859> want<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> receive<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.910> that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
the satellite I want to receive so that

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.170 
the satellite I want to receive so that
I<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.450> need<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.019> change<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.160> SM<00:03:03.519> with<00:03:03.670> left

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I only need to change the SM with left

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.670 
I only need to change the SM with left
and<00:03:04.359> right<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:06.989> as<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.140> move<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.470> dish

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and right and as you move the dish

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.430 
and right and as you move the dish
around<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.670> will<00:03:09.850> see<00:03:10.150> there<00:03:10.540> are<00:03:10.569> certain

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
around you will see there are certain

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.470 
around you will see there are certain
positions<00:03:13.140> where<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:15.579> will<00:03:15.790> pick<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.090> an

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
positions where you will pick up an

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.990 
positions where you will pick up an
increase<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.230> noise<00:03:17.410> we<00:03:18.190> see<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.519> here<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:18.970> I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
increase in noise we see it here now I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.379 
increase in noise we see it here now I
pass<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.630> point<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.519> pass<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.090> point

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
pass the point and here I pass the point

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.379 
pass the point and here I pass the point
here<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.780> no<00:03:25.989> signal<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:27.519> can<00:03:27.730> see<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.269> the

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
here is no signal you can see it in the

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:37.690 
here is no signal you can see it in the
waterfall<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:29.260> well<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.859> in<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:31.829> FFT

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.839 

here's<00:03:38.700> probably<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.420> sweet<00:03:39.690> spot<00:03:40.670> here<00:03:41.670> we

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
here's probably the sweet spot here we

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.460 
here's probably the sweet spot here we
are<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.530> maxed<00:03:43.890> out<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.190> signal<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
are so we have maxed out the signal the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.740 
are so we have maxed out the signal the
FFT<00:03:46.980> has<00:03:47.190> increased<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.970> noise<00:03:48.180> floor<00:03:48.420> we

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
FFT has increased the noise floor we

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.750 
FFT has increased the noise floor we
can't<00:03:49.020> see<00:03:49.230> any<00:03:49.440> actual<00:03:49.860> signal<00:03:50.280> because<00:03:50.610> this

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
can't see any actual signal because this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.559 
can't see any actual signal because this
is<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> wideband<00:03:51.750> very<00:03:52.110> wideband<00:03:53.239> phase<00:03:54.239> shift

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
is a wideband very wideband phase shift

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.670 
is a wideband very wideband phase shift
key<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.280> digital<00:03:56.280> satellite<00:03:56.760> signal<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.650> we

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
key to digital satellite signal so we

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
key to digital satellite signal so we
can't<00:03:59.069> see<00:03:59.310> actual<00:03:59.760> signal<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.480> noise

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
can't see actual signal so this noise

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.670 
can't see actual signal so this noise
that<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:01.260> are<00:04:01.380> seeing<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.040> actual<00:04:02.459> signal
