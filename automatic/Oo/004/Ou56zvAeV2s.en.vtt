the cap on really quick somebody doing

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.410 
the cap on really quick somebody doing
one<00:02:09.039> finger<00:02:09.340> um

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
one finger um

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.740 
one finger um
now<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.540> kind<00:02:14.019> of<00:02:14.230> globs<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.540> say

now it kind of globs on so and I say

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.170 
now it kind of globs on so and I say
glob<00:02:16.989> just<00:02:17.260> cuz<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.530> was<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.769> big<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:19.060> you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
glob just cuz it was like a big like you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.699 
glob just cuz it was like a big like you
almost<00:02:19.299> had<00:02:19.510> too<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.989> brush<00:02:20.230> kind<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
almost had too much on a brush kind of a

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.250 
almost had too much on a brush kind of a
thing<00:02:20.890> um<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:22.299> have<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.450> wait<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.780> let<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.049> dry

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
thing um you have to wait to let it dry

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740 
thing um you have to wait to let it dry
and<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> found<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.030> when<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.510> dries

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and what I found was that when it dries

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.670 
and what I found was that when it dries
because<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.560> right<00:02:26.709> now<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:28.680> probably

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
because like right now you can probably

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.250 
because like right now you can probably
see<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> difference<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.030> whitening<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.170> know

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
see a difference in whitening you know

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.940 
see a difference in whitening you know
how<00:02:32.440> white<00:02:32.849> they<00:02:33.849> look<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.709> one's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
how white they look it's like this one's

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.490 
how white they look it's like this one's
white<00:02:39.190> or<00:02:39.640> yeah<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.840> one's<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.319> with

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
white or yeah this one's the one with

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.330 
white or yeah this one's the one with
the<00:02:41.620> nail<00:02:41.769> polish<00:02:42.090> um<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.590> what<00:02:44.769> happens<00:02:45.190> is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the nail polish um but what happens is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.770 
the nail polish um but what happens is
like<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.760> already<00:02:45.910> see<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.569> I'm

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
like you can already see like I'm

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.080 
like you can already see like I'm
shaking<00:02:47.410> around<00:02:47.500> which<00:02:47.829> isn't<00:02:48.010> good<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.849> it's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
shaking around which isn't good but it's

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.390 
shaking around which isn't good but it's
pretty<00:02:49.360> liquidy<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.500> tends<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.280> know

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
pretty liquidy so it tends to you know

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.729 
pretty liquidy so it tends to you know
kind<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.180> roll<00:02:52.420> around<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.930> your<00:02:53.079> finger<00:02:53.530> a

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
kind of roll around on your finger a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.440 
kind of roll around on your finger a
little<00:02:54.579> bit<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.590> um<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:57.579> actually<00:02:57.610> dry<00:02:58.390> is

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
little bit and um it actually dry is

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.360 
little bit and um it actually dry is
kind<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.319> way<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> where<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:00.190> sort

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
kind of that way to where you can sort

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.379 
kind of that way to where you can sort
of<00:03:00.519> see<00:03:00.970> where<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.510> dried<00:03:01.900> um<00:03:02.850> which<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.000> do<00:03:04.060> not

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
of see where it dried um which I do not

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.500 
of see where it dried um which I do not
care<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.680> because<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.819> more<00:03:07.000> liquidy

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
care for so because of the more liquidy

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.920 
care for so because of the more liquidy
and<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.930> should<00:03:08.109> can<00:03:08.200> shake<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.500> up<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.930> don't

my gosh I have to fix it right now then
that<00:03:25.389> would<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.870> good<00:03:26.049> thing<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
that would be a good thing to have and

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.390 
that would be a good thing to have and
so<00:03:27.010> I'd<00:03:27.130> recommend<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.209> be<00:03:28.359> in<00:03:28.630> your<00:03:28.840> um

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
so I'd recommend this to be in your um

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.759 
so I'd recommend this to be in your um
sort<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.489> collection<00:03:31.049> but<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.139> it's<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
sort of collection but if it's like the

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.500 
sort of collection but if it's like the
only<00:03:32.920> way<00:03:33.250> you're<00:03:33.459> gonna<00:03:33.579> do<00:03:33.880> French<00:03:34.209> nails

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
only way you're gonna do French nails

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.220 
only way you're gonna do French nails
and<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.739> think<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.250> will<00:03:36.599> be<00:03:37.599> better<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
and you think that this will be better I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.020 
and you think that this will be better I
think<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.829> based<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.220> personal<00:03:39.639> preference

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
think it based on personal preference

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.309 
think it based on personal preference
but<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.299> am<00:03:40.569> going<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.959> stick<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.560> my<00:03:42.209> actual

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
but I am going to stick to my actual

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.140 
but I am going to stick to my actual
nail<00:03:44.319> polish<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.250> do<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> by<00:03:45.669> hand<00:03:45.700> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
nail polish and just do it by hand I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.140 
nail polish and just do it by hand I
have<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.419> steady<00:03:46.780> hand<00:03:46.900> um<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.459> I'll<00:03:48.639> just<00:03:48.880> do<00:03:49.030> it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
have a steady hand um so I'll just do it

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.680 
have a steady hand um so I'll just do it
myself

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
myself

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.710 
myself
with<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.169> regular<00:03:50.410> brush<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.730> apply<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.419> that

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
with a regular brush and apply it that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.319 
with a regular brush and apply it that
way<00:03:52.870> um<00:03:53.400> maybe<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.639> don't<00:03:54.849> have<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> steady

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
way um maybe if you don't have a steady

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.089 
way um maybe if you don't have a steady
hand<00:03:55.480> maybe<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.169> will<00:03:56.319> be<00:03:56.380> easier<00:03:56.739> for<00:03:56.799> you

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
hand maybe this will be easier for you

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.270 
hand maybe this will be easier for you
you<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.730> use<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.139> up<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.709> um<00:04:00.010> I

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
you to use so it's really up to you um I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.129 
you to use so it's really up to you um I
mean<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.549> can<00:04:00.730> kind<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.090> see<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.419> does<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:01.959> on

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
mean you can kind of see it does go on

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.020 
mean you can kind of see it does go on
easy<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.680> mean<00:04:02.859> that<00:04:03.010> was<00:04:03.160> basically<00:04:03.669> all<00:04:03.880> you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
easy I mean that was basically all you

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.479 
easy I mean that was basically all you
do<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.389> just<00:04:04.540> put<00:04:04.750> on<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> tip<00:04:05.200> um<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.430> a

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
do is just put on the tip um so it's a

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.140 
do is just put on the tip um so it's a
lot<00:04:06.699> less<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.449> know<00:04:07.540> fuss<00:04:07.930> but<00:04:08.739> for<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.150> better

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
lot less you know fuss but for a better

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.100 
lot less you know fuss but for a better
result<00:04:10.570> I'll<00:04:10.900> spend<00:04:11.590> more<00:04:11.739> time

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
result I'll spend more time

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.630 
result I'll spend more time
I'm<00:04:12.200> willing<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.620> spend<00:04:12.980> more<00:04:13.070> time<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.520> it

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
I'm willing to spend more time to do it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.520 
I'm willing to spend more time to do it
the<00:04:13.730> other<00:04:13.760> way<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.510> this<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.020> just<00:04:15.170> sort<00:04:15.350> of<00:04:15.470> an

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the other way so this is just sort of an

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.860 
the other way so this is just sort of an
idea<00:04:15.620> um<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.310> wanted<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.329> this<00:04:17.480> video<00:04:17.660> done

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
idea um I wanted to get this video done

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.080 
idea um I wanted to get this video done
really<00:04:18.500> quickly<00:04:18.980> so<00:04:19.220> it's<00:04:19.340> not<00:04:19.459> my<00:04:19.640> best<00:04:19.820> one

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
really quickly so it's not my best one

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.530 
really quickly so it's not my best one
because<00:04:21.019> I'm<00:04:21.290> actually<00:04:21.530> giving<00:04:21.859> this<00:04:22.100> away

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
because I'm actually giving this away

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.240 
because I'm actually giving this away
within<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.720> day<00:04:23.870> or<00:04:23.900> two<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.380> think<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:24.980> was<00:04:25.100> like

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
within a day or two I think it was like

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.930 
within a day or two I think it was like
five<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.240> six<00:04:26.480> bucks<00:04:26.750> um<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.790> not

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
five to six bucks um but it's just not

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.430 
five to six bucks um but it's just not
for<00:04:29.120> me<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.450> I'm<00:04:29.540> gonna<00:04:29.660> give<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.900> away<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.380> I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440
