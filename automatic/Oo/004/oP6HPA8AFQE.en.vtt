00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.920
 Tell me, my name is ronaldo ferreira. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 its director of the 'era' aeromodelismo modes 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.750
 staff the tip of today the installation of 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.670
 hinge as we travel a lot is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 straight on the track out there 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 we often see model airplanes with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.250
 a tougher control surface or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.710
 firmer 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 this happens a lot because the staff at 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 time to install the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.820
 Hinge excess glue picks up where 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 goes the union style of the two hinge 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.519
 and leaves the control surface more 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.729
 hard and is an important tip is super 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:48.229
 easy where leaving is not going to happen 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:51.059
 never sooner a thread of oil in the 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.949
 in the union of the two parts the hinge of the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.839
 two sides where erechim goes 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.030
 here in my case I'm using a landfill 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.659
 and could be anyone's oil 5 my 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.839
 Are not you easy, son? 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.360
 hinges for when you tinker 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.020
 in charge there is excess glue will of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 scoreboard 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.560
 the hinge at the top will fill you up 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.649
 juice you made you buy you fill 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 it takes preference the hypothesis 24 by 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.229
 After she has completely healed, she becomes more 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 rigid she becomes more glazed and she 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.490
 break says hinge plate you fill 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 the south totally 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.210
 if burr is left over when you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.149
 has shinosuke always left over burr 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.479
 another legal tip toilet paper 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.829
 it can be something of common post or alcohol 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.249
 buy at the market 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.140
 You come and clean the excess to stay. 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:47.009
 no residue gets a more finish 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.780
 legal would be the excess to take the whole 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.369
 and applying grids residue is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.829
 another thing you do not need to dust 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.789
 that the hinge is only you fill well 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.130
 the juice where you made the command that is already 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.630
 enough 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.460
 this so for you to use an epoxy of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 24 hours preferred quality 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.810
 applying the hinge I will say in the case 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.360
 here I'll do it once but you let me 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 this part dries the 24 hours later 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.830
 use of force 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.560
 has already been dried it does the same 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.930
 wing procedure 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.450
 fill in the juices you made if left over 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:36.150
 it's glue you clean to excess to take 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.870
 the residue comes and installs eron 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 in case here 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 installed 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 I learned from a tape to secure the command 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.209
 after the complete cure of the glue that here in the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.360
 case a 24 hour hypothesis 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.880
 you only make this move that the excess 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.040
 of glue that got there on the hinge 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.970
 he will explain you take it out with a 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.950
 with a pin and the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.770
 command will stay so light will not go 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.910
 catch glue will not go to the glass will not hang 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.850
 your command 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.010
 nor endanger either its aircraft or 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.800
 risk you burn some I at 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.560
 than our tip and staff 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.160
