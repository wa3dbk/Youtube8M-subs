chord so it's the same shape but you're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.060 
chord so it's the same shape but you're
moving<00:01:20.250> everything<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> string<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.200> up

just<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.180> next<00:01:30.600> chord

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
just like that and then the next chord

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.789 
just like that and then the next chord
is

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
is

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.039
