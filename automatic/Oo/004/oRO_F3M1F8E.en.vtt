the Magic Mouse Apple was one of the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.709 
the Magic Mouse Apple was one of the
first<00:00:57.480> Mouse's<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> has<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the to the Metro interface and one of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.310 
the to the Metro interface and one of
the<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> bottom<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> configure<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the on the bottom you can configure it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.350 
the on the bottom you can configure it
and<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> normal<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:39.299> like

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and it's like the normal just like

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.620 
and it's like the normal just like
pressing<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.700> wheel<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> normal<00:01:42.329> Mouse

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
pressing the the wheel on a normal Mouse

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.039 
pressing the the wheel on a normal Mouse
now<00:01:43.470> besides<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:45.049> right

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
now besides that you have your to right

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
now besides that you have your to right
and<00:01:46.229> left<00:01:46.430> mouse<00:01:47.430> buttons<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> traditional

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and left mouse buttons the traditional

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.450 
and left mouse buttons the traditional
ones<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> better<00:01:50.070> than<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
ones and I think this is better than the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.380 
ones and I think this is better than the
Magic<00:01:50.759> Mouse<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.180> Apple<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:53.390> makes

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
Magic Mouse of Apple because it's makes

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
Magic Mouse of Apple because it's makes
a<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:54.810> separation<00:01:55.590> between<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.979> two

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a more separation between these two

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
a more separation between these two
buttons<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> Magic

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
buttons you know you know the Magic

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
buttons you know you know the Magic
Mouse<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:58.979> piece<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.729> when<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

press rather left it seems like the
entire<00:02:02.759> plastic<00:02:03.509> surface<00:02:03.840> goes<00:02:04.049> down<00:02:04.350> instead

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
entire plastic surface goes down instead

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219

if you like the way it clicks my my

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.310 
if you like the way it clicks my my
previous<00:02:35.880> mouse<00:02:36.880> was<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> Microsoft<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
previous mouse was a Microsoft and the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.480 
previous mouse was a Microsoft and the
click<00:02:38.560> was<00:02:38.710> when<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> press<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:42.010> bottom

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
click was when you press it the bottom

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.850

he<00:02:42.850> went<00:02:43.090> down<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> lot<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.870> actually<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> didn't

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
he went down a lot and actually I didn't

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.460 
he went down a lot and actually I didn't
like<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.000> better<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.690> think<00:02:46.960> it's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
like that so this is better I think it's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.680
