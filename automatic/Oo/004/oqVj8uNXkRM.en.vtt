 hello today we are going to prepare a picture of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 photos import photos for the day of the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.820
 mother who is running out little was going to be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.669
 a very original gift for it what 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 we have done has been copying mom in 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:21.540
 cardboard and in the letters the fabric we have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 open and there we will put two photos 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.350
 one each 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 once we have copied it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 we will cut and once we have 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 clipped what we're going to do is that you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 let's move on to rubber eva we'll copy it and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.800
 we will form it so that we stay 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.800
 much more original 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.410
 We have already copied it with rubber eva and 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.290
 Now what we are going to do is paste it 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.410
 they are very simple I have traced it and I have 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.579
 cut 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 and we are going to paste it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.600
 and we are going to prepare our photos for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.489
 put them here 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.260
 I 'm going to be for my mother I'm going to 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.170
 take one with her 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.640
 I'm going to stick it, I'll teach it 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.580
 we have stuck and now what are we going to 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.740
 to do is cut a cardboard square 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.030
 to put it from behind to hold the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.369
 Photo 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 I've done when I put this on a 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.420
 tad bigger so that later it does not 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.220
 I saw the burr this cardboard like 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.450
 It has been very good 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.230
 and now what we are going to do is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.780
 expect it we will stick it on the side by 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.850
 down here and on the other side up 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.630
 we have to put the photo we're going to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.540
 stick your fingers 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.160
 and we will add the photo that we want 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.160
 and we'll have it ready 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.130
 Well we have finished it, nothing 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.450
 as you have seen it is super simple 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.580
 I hope you do what is left 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.500
