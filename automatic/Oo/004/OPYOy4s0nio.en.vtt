00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
printed it and I tested it and I thought

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.640 
printed it and I tested it and I thought
it<00:01:07.729> was<00:01:07.790> great<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.750> demo<00:01:08.990> was<00:01:09.200> great<00:01:09.409> but

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
it was great but the demo was great but

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.380 
it was great but the demo was great but
when<00:01:10.040> I<00:01:10.070> played<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.490> game<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.909> was<00:01:11.090> even
