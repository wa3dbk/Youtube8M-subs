00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello to you all montijo is talking 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.490
 a little about the father of the church 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.929
 inácio this father of the Church of 30,107 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 after Christ is the seductive myth that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.050
 represents this father with a small child 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 whom you put in the midst of your 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 apostles Matthew 18 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.330
 story that this child is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 stagnant 18 12 sets puts between 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.989
 the apostles would possibly be 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.600
 expanded product called 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 less the period in which it may have in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 that he was a disciple of policarpo 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 john is merely a tradition as the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.969
 matter of which I was born polycarp spoke 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 john's disciples it is not just 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 of a tradition that the question of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.690
 believe that in your mind this crisis 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.219
 it is also a tradition without 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 some purchases reach only one 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.469
 speculation 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 in all the works of Ignatius 15 clues that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.409
 takes the name of nasr 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 these are one for the virgin Maria to two 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.689
 to the apostle joão a majority of cassol 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 beautiful or deadly sense what years 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.330
 one was the mold to which antic an 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.119
 Penance one refers to a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 trunk sum to the bad romans philadelphia 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.540
 years and publish the first three 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.290
 there are in Latin then the first three 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.210
 the time of Maria and the salt two to the apostle 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 joão exists in Latin all the rest 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 tingri the universal opinion of the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 that the first of eight of these 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.659
 letters and is born anna south in sweden 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.149
 choice of critics size 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.420
 I believe they are spurious they carry 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.390
 in itself the undoubted proof of being the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 production is more advanced in the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.009
 that which is born made people 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.950
 that all this is quite possibly there 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.170
 who says this is eusébio or girona 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 neither does the cute little do not make the slightest 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.100
 reference to them 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.260
 good as if it had not existed 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.940
 but once the question has been so 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.040
 simplified still remains 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.550
 complex enough of the seven 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.210
 pistols that are recognized by 10 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.970
 the genre recognizes seven pistols two 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.370
 versions are in Greek one shorter and the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.550
 it is clear that one or more 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.980
 another of these provisions with the text 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.600
 Peter agrees that scholars agree 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.090
 accept the shortest form as 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.220
 representing the real cards of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.800
 inacio 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.350
 the critics or if there in which of 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.670
 epistles should be accepted and which 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.030
 rejected 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.520
 there is the scent isaac and collect oils 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.100
 and others edit the subscribers 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.930
 attributed to inace differently 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.040
 until finally around the beginning 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.110
 from the 18th century to 7 floors of the Greeks came 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.520
 to be accepted in their shortest form 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.670
 like the actual writings of en masse 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.830
 the main source of information on 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.350
 it is found in the records of 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.630
 Kingfisher , which reader is referred 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.880
 publish with his father also does 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.570
 allusion to him in his epistle to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.930
 Philippians and his letters 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.200
 the church quoted another 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.980
 of the suites there the Romans without 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.930
 however naming origins twice 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
 refers to it for the first time in the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.310
 preface your comment in the field to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.200
 of Solomon where he quotes a passage from the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 epistle to train only humans and 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.450
 again in san francisco - on lucas 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.050
 where he quotes ipso to the Ephesians both 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.570
 naming the author where I want to go 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.590
 with this from here and bibliographical below 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:01.490
 I do not know if you see but here is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.290
 This father of the church is he's from 30 to 107 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.730
 after Christ the same thing too 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.080
 makes no mention of divinity or even about 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.540
 of the trinity 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.240
 ok then it is the study that asked me 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.800
 stock researching and studying 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.810
 So I'm telling you just the 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.570
 view of which church because 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.150
 I do not have tapiro in this period here 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.080
 there is no pap in concerning this 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.610
 period 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.430
 if there is no where to get the idea 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.560
 So how do you say I can not take the Bible? 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.780
 to say that it is here in the bible 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.659
 has no small talk're so then I 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.939
 arrive until I take the first tattoo 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:42.199
 in history is right then another father 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:43.610
 there is adaptation according to the 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.550
 historians seconds 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.560
 the critics are also there more than 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.909
 the work of nárcio considered is considered 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.900
 that really came from the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.150
 his work 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.979
 there is no mention of divinity much less 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.520
 of 30 the arm is twisted to the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.520
 next champions
