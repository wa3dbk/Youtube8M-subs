then we'll go over the permission notes
so<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.410> quick<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.040> make

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so this will be as quick as I can make

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
so this will be as quick as I can make
it<00:00:35.219> without<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.880> making<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.480> clear<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it without with making it as clear as I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.470 
it without with making it as clear as I
can<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.390> can

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
can so first thing we can do is we can

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.810 
can so first thing we can do is we can
see<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> action<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:41.520> default

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
see that is it in action it by default

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
see that is it in action it by default
it<00:00:42.210> has<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> few<00:00:42.629> custom<00:00:43.110> ones<00:00:43.290> set<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it has a few custom ones set up and so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
it has a few custom ones set up and so
this<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.120> put<00:00:45.480> admin<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> front<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> anybody

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this will put admin in front of anybody

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.490 
this will put admin in front of anybody
who's<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.370> OP<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.899> that's<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.110> cool<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
who's an OP and that's pretty cool it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
who's an OP and that's pretty cool it
just<00:00:49.680> puts<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> front<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> name<00:00:50.670> it's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just puts it in front of the name it's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
just puts it in front of the name it's
kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> scoreboard<00:00:52.559> above<00:00:53.070> name

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
kind of like the scoreboard above name

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
kind of like the scoreboard above name
if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.510> above<00:00:54.780> player<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> know

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
if you know or above player if you know

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
if you know or above player if you know
that<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.449> works<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that one and this is how it works now as

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
that one and this is how it works now as
soon<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.239> it's<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> clear

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
soon as we do this it's going to clear

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319 
soon as we do this it's going to clear
out<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> custom<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.149> will

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
out that custom one because this will

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
out that custom one because this will
take<00:01:03.510> precedence<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.229> we'll<00:01:04.530> show<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.799> how

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
take precedence but we'll show you how

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.789 
take precedence but we'll show you how
to<00:01:05.010> change<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.180> n<00:01:06.390> E<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.930> NT<00:01:07.770> e

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to change that so you can do n E or NT e

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
to change that so you can do n E or NT e
whichever<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.850> works<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
whichever one works if any is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
whichever one works if any is
conflicting<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.740> another<00:01:11.189> plugin<00:01:11.610> we're

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
conflicting with another plugin we're

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
conflicting with another plugin we're
going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.390> suffix<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.260> means<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going to do suffix that just means it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350 
going to do suffix that just means it's
going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> end<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.210> then

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
going to put it to the end and then

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to put it to the end and then
we're<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> cons<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.380> Christ<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> now

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
we're going to cons for Christ and now

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
we're going to cons for Christ and now
the<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the one thing you want to do is you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.120 
the one thing you want to do is you
don't<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.259> put<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> word<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.860> here

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
don't want to just put a word in here

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
don't want to just put a word in here
because<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because what it's going to do is just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
because what it's going to do is just
put<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> end<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
put it at the end and it's going to be

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
put it at the end and it's going to be
the<00:01:23.640> same<00:01:23.850> color<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.630> username<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.320> it's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the same color as the username and it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
the same color as the username and it's
not<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> space<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> do

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
not going to have a space so how you do

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.710 
not going to have a space so how you do
space<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> quote<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.759> then<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
space is you do a quote and then the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.319 
space is you do a quote and then the
word<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.259> we're<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> put

isn't a whole lot to this one like I
said<00:03:27.870> before<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.620> do<00:03:31.710> tablets<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
said before and you can do tablets and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.120 
said before and you can do tablets and
naval<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.050> by<00:03:34.050> default<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
naval now by default this is all the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.400 
naval now by default this is all the
defaults<00:03:35.550> here<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.630> probably<00:03:36.900> not

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
defaults here so you can probably not

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.020 
defaults here so you can probably not
even<00:03:37.560> touch<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.040> after<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.400> start<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.730> plug

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
even touch this after you start to plug

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.540 
even touch this after you start to plug
in<00:03:39.210> but<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.720> Tablas<00:03:40.320> enabled<00:03:40.890> false<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.520> that

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
in but you Tablas enabled false and that

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.240 
in but you Tablas enabled false and that
will<00:03:42.330> arm<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.440> set<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.890> true<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> will

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
will arm if you set that to true it will

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.050 
will arm if you set that to true it will
remove<00:03:44.520> any<00:03:44.700> formatted<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.860> tab<00:03:47.100> list<00:03:47.430> so

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
remove any formatted in the tab list so

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360 
remove any formatted in the tab list so
if<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.320> any<00:03:49.470> other<00:03:49.650> plugins<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.190> do

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
if you have any other plugins that do

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.580 
if you have any other plugins that do
that<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.910> set<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.900> up<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.290> also<00:03:52.380> it'll

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
that don't set this up but also it'll

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.070 
that don't set this up but also it'll
wreck<00:03:53.250> all<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.880> then<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:54.930> might

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
wreck all of that then this will might

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.170 
wreck all of that then this will might
be<00:03:55.200> good<00:03:55.350> if<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.560> set<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> true<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.580> then

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
be good if you set this to true and then

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.410 
be good if you set this to true and then
you<00:03:57.330> add<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.830> yourself<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.700> permission

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
you add this to yourself this permission

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.570 
you add this to yourself this permission
note<00:04:00.780> it'll<00:04:01.290> notify<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.770> every<00:04:02.070> time<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.370> log

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
note it'll notify you every time you log

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.190 
note it'll notify you every time you log
in<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:03.000> there's<00:04:03.180> an<00:04:03.300> update<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> plugin

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
in that there's an update for the plugin

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.180 
in that there's an update for the plugin
which<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.710> handy<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.250> then<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.980> one

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
which is really handy and then this one

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.310 
which is really handy and then this one
I<00:04:08.220> think<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.730> one's<00:04:09.030> worded<00:04:09.480> backwards<00:04:10.050> if

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
I think this one's worded backwards if

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.360 
I think this one's worded backwards if
you<00:04:10.860> set<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.400> true<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.780> should<00:04:13.280> put<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
you set this to true it should put the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
you set this to true it should put the
prefix<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.880> suffix<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.720> console<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:16.470> by

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
prefix and suffix in the console so by

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.430 
prefix and suffix in the console so by
default<00:04:16.830> it's<00:04:17.280> false<00:04:17.750> which<00:04:18.750> it'll<00:04:19.170> probably

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
default it's false which it'll probably

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.020 
default it's false which it'll probably
probably<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.190> better<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.549> leave<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> way

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
probably be better to leave it that way

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.580 
probably be better to leave it that way
and<00:04:21.330> keep<00:04:21.540> your<00:04:21.690> counsel<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:22.140> little<00:04:22.350> cleaner

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and keep your counsel a little cleaner

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.190 
and keep your counsel a little cleaner
so<00:04:22.980> that<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.460> for<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.850> config<00:04:24.690> file<00:04:24.930> let's

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
so that is it for the config file let's

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.159 
so that is it for the config file let's
take<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> look

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
take a look

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.629 
take a look
we<00:04:26.349> get<00:04:26.499> into<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> permission<00:04:27.219> notes<00:04:27.370> let's

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
we get into the permission notes let's

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.869 
we get into the permission notes let's
take<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:27.819> look<00:04:28.060> at<00:04:28.240> some<00:04:28.569> of<00:04:28.599> these<00:04:28.780> cool<00:04:29.110> little

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
take a look at some of these cool little

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.339 
take a look at some of these cool little
text<00:04:30.879> files<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:31.240> here<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.569> first<00:04:31.780> one<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.199> can

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
text files in here the first one you can

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.279 
text files in here the first one you can
do<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.219> can<00:04:33.370> get<00:04:33.879> open<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.509> groups<00:04:34.749> now

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
do is you can get open the groups now

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.510 
do is you can get open the groups now
this<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.860> nice<00:04:36.189> because<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.939> lets<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.659> add<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
this is nice because it lets you add a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.800 
this is nice because it lets you add a
custom<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:40.719> custom<00:04:42.180> permission<00:04:43.180> nodes<00:04:43.449> and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
custom on a custom permission nodes and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.510 
custom on a custom permission nodes and
that<00:04:44.379> you<00:04:44.469> can<00:04:44.590> add<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.830> groups

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that you can add to groups

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670 
that you can add to groups
so<00:04:45.729> when<00:04:45.879> people<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:47.020> could<00:04:47.199> even<00:04:47.379> use<00:04:47.650> this

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
so when people you could even use this

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.980 
so when people you could even use this
for<00:04:48.129> like<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.639> have<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.789> prison<00:04:49.180> server<00:04:49.419> you

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
for like if you have a prison server you

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.779 
for like if you have a prison server you
can<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.319> it<00:04:50.439> so<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.710> shows<00:04:50.919> a<00:04:50.979> person's<00:04:51.490> group

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
can have it so it shows a person's group

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.989 
can have it so it shows a person's group
above<00:04:52.210> their<00:04:52.629> user<00:04:53.319> names<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.889> put<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.099> name

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
above their user names so you put a name

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.809 
above their user names so you put a name
tag<00:04:55.210> group<00:04:55.629> dot<00:04:55.930> C<00:04:56.379> or<00:04:56.710> whatever<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.249> then<00:04:57.669> the

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
tag group dot C or whatever and then the

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.149 
tag group dot C or whatever and then the
the<00:04:58.090> prefix<00:04:58.569> is<00:04:58.750> just<00:04:59.110> C<00:04:59.349> in<00:04:59.469> here<00:04:59.680> so<00:04:59.860> other

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
the prefix is just C in here so other

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.429 
the prefix is just C in here so other
people<00:05:00.250> can<00:05:00.639> see<00:05:00.699> that<00:05:01.029> the<00:05:01.150> older<00:05:01.509> their<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.169> C

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
people can see that the older their a C

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.769 
people can see that the older their a C
prisoner<00:05:02.889> or<00:05:03.129> whatever<00:05:03.729> these<00:05:04.389> are<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.629> ones

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:04.779 
prisoner or whatever these are the ones

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.209 
prisoner or whatever these are the ones
that<00:05:04.840> are<00:05:04.990> just<00:05:05.080> in<00:05:05.229> there<00:05:05.379> by<00:05:05.529> default<00:05:05.590> and

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
that are just in there by default and

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:09.240 
that are just in there by default and
this<00:05:06.819> one's<00:05:07.060> assigned<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.750> ops<00:05:08.129> anybody<00:05:09.129> who

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
this one's assigned to ops anybody who

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.629 
this one's assigned to ops anybody who
is<00:05:09.370> an<00:05:09.759> operator<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:11.770> feel<00:05:12.400> free<00:05:12.460> to
