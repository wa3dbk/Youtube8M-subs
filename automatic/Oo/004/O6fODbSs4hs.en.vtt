 j 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.290
 veronique every day with thomas 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.560
 vanderveken 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.270
 wealth hey i have a question why its 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.740
 the subsidies for the solar panels 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.020
 actually abolished 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.510
 so close to trying the whole of Friesland 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.090
 Limburg and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.430
 brush and is viewed once a year 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.489
 the chilly crazy contradictory 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.769
 width for the installation 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.130
 we have a prototype that works for 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:44.090
 an installation and financial return 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.610
 from 5% to 15 years so it could be that 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.410
 the subsidies still come back then joke 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.020
 sometime can yes every day like the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.930
 take care against the proceeds so much 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.140
 bald that one can achieve in the people 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.760
 then there is no fool, so if 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.710
 I'm right then you say 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.089
 Solar panels are such a good investment 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.960
 currently no subsidies 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.310
 needed 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.119
 free not free crack with a saving 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.640
 cookie ria 5% that I no longer there 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.590
 dimension 2 now and in the future yes 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.150
 ok so clear 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.150
 thank you very much done garden 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 bluer ones occur in front of you 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 the ideal 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.299
 what is my first time when my weeks 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.420
 to my childhood in mumps 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:47.170
 tuan those play playgrounds away 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.820
 their primum have an old and blind 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.530
 you finally reasonable cooperation 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 when your boss about outings in this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.759
 Tomorrow will start in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.810
 Belgium will die at four o'clock 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.159
 so one day too 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.899
 the level is not wasted one day 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.369
 that big impact on the spray on the deck 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.500
 and we have to install the panels 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 where are we going to serve dividing cables and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.210
 there we will be the owner of the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.489
 property that you are searching a route 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 little ink active roll can any lid 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.200
 panels turn the weight around 12 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.060
 sorry i have partly so normal that is possible 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.530
 seat wearing a tiled roof home was 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.140
 about this on tile roofs 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.730
 delicias salt doctor tv solar panels there 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.830
 you take a flat roof that I work with 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.750
 an odd that we are the way under 15 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 sit down also a little possible though 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 water test treasury go hard to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.959
 working african of course you now worry 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 for paying that now for installation 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.000
 14 calvaneo for this installation 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.470
 6,600 euros delivered and reset 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.660
 and how much time have you already had 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.299
 recovered from strangeness is 7 to 8 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.060
 year for a pv installation like you 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.519
 know that the service life of the panels 25 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.940
 year master and servant is a lot 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.940
 possible 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.270
 actually seems fun to learn 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.920
 tempted him when the sun shines 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.080
 sympathy on the you all me that writing 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.610
 come and grab family but you can already 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.780
 introduce at rain ida 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.330
 to sweat hell 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.840
 waste what you 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.810
 the old cities therefore have solar panels 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.519
 installing is super easy and after 8 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.200
 year you have your money according to the contractor 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.110
 quite the mentioned 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.540
 but that's true because the check goes 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.420
 I visit boys he is a specialist 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.310
 in green thing that thomas is normal 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.940
 green dress yes 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.260
 goodwitch dress well and will pull 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.840
 one so first a key and how one 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.379
 solar panel works so that is actually 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 probably the solar panel itself 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.400
 is paper thin 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.380
 half a minute falls on here and and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.730
 releases electrons that pass through these 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.650
 electrical conductors 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.209
 be sent to the inverter 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.590
 it is by the heat with is through 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.950
 it slightly completely by the right 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.780
 because is very disadvantageous because the return 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.150
 of the solar panel drops by half 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.829
 percent per degree above 20 degrees 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.200
 and if you have a solar panel image you are on 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.349
 an apple and summer soon screams 80 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.269
 degrees are 40% less efficiency but 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.720
 because there is more sunlight, notice that 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.390
 not very 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.519
 so a cold sunny day the best yes 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.750
 I would be here on the roof of a de 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.750
 view installation while 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:28.120
 more country day or well so the cnc 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.520
 solution that was completely wrong 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.110
 pijnacker solar panels are sure 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.420
 have not been interested in energy 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.600
 produce are rather small-scale that 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.550
 is really research and then there is the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.080
 in recent years a major evolution in the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.310
 world of the solar panel and one 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.410
 treat the return of a 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.080
 solar panel around 12 percent 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.120
 two words they surely at 16% and the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.190
 with a pre slow cooker every 6 euros per 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.110
 what I while the now less than two 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.850
 hour was the return is something better 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.980
 but especially the price divided by 3 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.990
 that's right so you want to punish me 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.610
 was soon to be the author of it 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.490
 solar panels except for one day and design 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.170
 about 8 years you have paper 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.990
 investment there that mother will 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.730
 rather at 10 to 11 years they decrease VAT 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.370
 electricity has its own we can 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.890
 back in the ass of solar panels something 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.540
 less interesting is because piece set 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.130
 cheaper shelter of course longer 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.560
 your solar panel that beat like one here 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.460
 so subsidies are the only ones 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.200
 The payback that you have is your 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.510
 electricity but it should be a 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.520
 be made 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.440
 although solar panels times 20 to 25 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.570
 last year is a weather inverters one 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.550
 not so just assume that one 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.580
 inverter 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.530
 replaced about 14 years will have 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.410
 and was again a cost 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.790
 from national 700 she must be the family 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.190
 that can make a lot of profit with the 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.780
 installation would be melting around 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.620
 three thousand three hundred kilowatt hours 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.200
 on yarmouth 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.440
 breaks there is around 600 euros a year 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.940
 and we go up 14 panels despite having to 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.290
 misunderstood but to run out 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.400
 then she comes across hema dennis 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.770
 last prices that for 6609 those 6,600 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.750
 euros by 600 euros annually 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.430
 I always rate then come on one 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.350
 payback time of around 11 years 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.850
 stood 11 years they have one 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.130
 solar panel back that's right 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.320
 and then you have another 9 years free there 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.120
 between small cuts in your armani bags 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.210
 maduro comes if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.130
 amounted to 2400 euros profit so I call that 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.110
 must be and takes into account the 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.780
 replace the inverter that tom fast 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.080
 700 euros will cost so you get something 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.530
 a watering can 700 euro animals fattest moven 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.700
 had good conversations with some also 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.620
 my shoes 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.540
 johannes take me to one 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.340
 nearby neighborhood to have some more 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.270
 give practical tips about the 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.130
 placement of solar panels is most important 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.050
 travel orientation is the solar panel one 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.610
 example very sure to sweat 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.650
 not all in the same way 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.570
 while that totally different in that line 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.640
 more to the south to the less 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.320
 optimally need shade at all times 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.970
 your solar panels tend to be a solar cell 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.680
 no projects are shadowed and we 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.780
 to know and to avoid that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.820
 it has a system and solar panels that 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.689
 ensures that the full 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.969
 solar panel pronounced 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.449
 and bird poop that is a may problem 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.539
 lies right that is really true with botox 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.909
 actually causes the shade 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.860
 that comes to dress on the solar cell so that 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:21.349
 that the panel is not turned off 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.239
 allowing that solar cell to perform well 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.969
 pay attention in the honesty he had 

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:27.949
 heats and optionally burn 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:29.959
 ground spots with my yes so now and then 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.389
 the sun when not thought possible 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:35.509
 sometimes to others 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:38.209
 ok so from 12 square meters it is 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.889
 already cost-effective to lay your solar panels 

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:42.589
 that must be directed to the south 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:45.759
 and there should be no shade from trees or 

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:45.759
 a chimney or follow 

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:50.319
 satisfied with the solar panels you ours 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:50.319
 no okay
