notice<00:02:20.010> while<00:02:20.340> you're<00:02:20.489> doing<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.060> needs

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
notice while you're doing get one needs

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.270 
notice while you're doing get one needs
to<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.450> added<00:02:21.660> or<00:02:21.959> blended<00:02:22.349> out<00:02:22.440> better<00:02:22.739> some

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to be added or blended out better some

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.650 
to be added or blended out better some
people<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:23.910> using<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.510> many

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
people don't like using so many

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.630 
people don't like using so many
eyeshadow<00:02:25.200> colors<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.129> if<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.310> got<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
eyeshadow colors but if you got the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.699 
eyeshadow colors but if you got the
shadow<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:27.810> over<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.349> because

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
shadow to do so I think over it because

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:48.210 
shadow to do so I think over it because
the<00:02:28.860> look<00:02:29.040> will<00:02:29.190> flow<00:02:29.400> better<00:02:29.580> together

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.900 

yep<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.160> inner<00:02:51.250> corner<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> eye

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
yep now in the inner corner of the eye

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.180 
yep now in the inner corner of the eye
above<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> blue<00:02:52.870> shadow<00:02:53.260> by<00:02:53.680> an<00:02:53.830> orange

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
above the blue shadow by an orange

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.310 
above the blue shadow by an orange
eyeshadow<00:02:54.370> you've<00:02:55.270> got<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.720> careful<00:02:55.990> when

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
eyeshadow you've got to be careful when

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.960 
eyeshadow you've got to be careful when
you<00:02:56.440> blend<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> blue<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.280> orange<00:02:57.460> shadows

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
you blend the blue and orange shadows

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.610 
you blend the blue and orange shadows
together<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.780> don't<00:02:59.170> want<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.500> end

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
together because you don't want to end

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.650 
together because you don't want to end
up<00:02:59.740> with<00:02:59.800> some<00:03:00.160> muddy<00:03:00.400> brownish<00:03:00.940> green<00:03:01.240> color

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
up with some muddy brownish green color

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.020 
up with some muddy brownish green color
so<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.710> don't<00:03:02.860> totally<00:03:03.220> blend<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.000> two

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
so if you don't totally blend the two

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.330 
so if you don't totally blend the two
together<00:03:04.270> it's<00:03:04.660> all<00:03:04.840> right<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.350> again<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.130> want

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
together it's all right and again I want

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.580 
together it's all right and again I want
a<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:06.640> nice<00:03:06.910> gradient<00:03:07.300> effect<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.350> use

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
a really nice gradient effect so I use

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.230 
a really nice gradient effect so I use
different<00:03:08.950> orange<00:03:09.220> shadows<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.760> achieve<00:03:10.060> this

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
different orange shadows to achieve this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.390 
different orange shadows to achieve this
look<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.380> don't<00:03:11.620> own<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> lot<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.310> eye

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
look if you don't own a lot of eye

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.250 
look if you don't own a lot of eye
shadow<00:03:12.450> colors<00:03:13.450> remember<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.990> can<00:03:14.170> always

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
shadow colors remember you can always

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.230 
shadow colors remember you can always
make<00:03:14.680> shadows<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.220> create<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> different<00:03:15.820> color

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
make shadows to create a different color

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.450 
make shadows to create a different color
I<00:03:16.510> said<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.050> before<00:03:17.200> makeup<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> lot<00:03:18.220> like

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
I said it before makeup is a lot like

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.520 
I said it before makeup is a lot like
painting<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.270> mix<00:03:19.510> two<00:03:20.110> different

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
painting you can mix two different

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.710 
painting you can mix two different
shadows<00:03:20.709> together<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.580> create<00:03:22.000> new<00:03:22.030> colors

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
shadows together and create new colors

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.810 
shadows together and create new colors
so<00:03:23.170> if<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.350> got<00:03:23.500> an<00:03:23.709> orange<00:03:23.920> shadow<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.640> one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
so if you got an orange shadow just one

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.310 
so if you got an orange shadow just one
and<00:03:25.060> you've<00:03:25.209> got<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.420> white<00:03:25.660> shadow<00:03:26.020> well<00:03:26.230> you

and you've got a white shadow well you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.750 
and you've got a white shadow well you
can<00:03:26.470> mix<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> two<00:03:26.860> together<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.490> a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
can mix the two together to get a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.780 
can mix the two together to get a
lighter<00:03:28.180> orange<00:03:28.690> shadow<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.490> on<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.730> so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
lighter orange shadow and so on and so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.830 
lighter orange shadow and so on and so
forth

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.480 

right<00:03:38.840> beside<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.380> orange<00:03:39.710> shadow<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.070> blend

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
right beside the orange shadow I blend

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.790 
right beside the orange shadow I blend
in<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.850> red<00:03:41.120> shadow<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.810> don't<00:03:42.320> worry<00:03:42.500> about

in a red shadow I don't worry about

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.920 
in a red shadow I don't worry about
blending<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.640> red<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.360> blue<00:03:44.570> shadow
