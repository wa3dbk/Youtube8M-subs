00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
we have to lower that whole step to D so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.820 
we have to lower that whole step to D so
we<00:01:15.410> should<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.770> dad<00:01:16.070> dad<00:01:18.520> hey<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.830> little

in between the second string which is

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.539 
in between the second string which is
now<00:02:38.810> an<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.200> string<00:02:39.560> because<00:02:39.739> we're<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.010> dadgad

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
now an a string because we're in dadgad

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.490 
now an a string because we're in dadgad
tuning<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.959> ad<00:02:42.319> G<00:02:42.650> ad<00:02:43.569> let<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.810> ring<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.109> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
tuning the ad G ad let that ring so that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.429 
tuning the ad G ad let that ring so that
that<00:02:45.650> one<00:02:45.799> rings<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:47.209> then<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:47.840> high<00:02:47.989> one<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
fretted by the fourth finger and then

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.089 
fretted by the fourth finger and then
with<00:02:53.450> each<00:02:53.480> chord<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.409> we<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.889> take<00:02:55.040> that

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
with each chord all we do is take that

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.690 
with each chord all we do is take that
shape<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.730> lower<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.389> third<00:02:56.629> finger<00:02:57.049> a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
shape and lower the third finger a

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.159 
shape and lower the third finger a
half-step<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.450> note<00:02:59.629> fretted<00:03:00.019> by<00:03:00.109> the

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
half-step to the note fretted by the

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.800 
half-step to the note fretted by the
second<00:03:00.590> finger

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.320 

and<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:07.370> we're<00:03:07.520> gonna<00:03:07.580> jump<00:03:07.940> down<00:03:08.090> to

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and then we're gonna jump down to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.910 
and then we're gonna jump down to
threats<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.860> jump<00:03:10.400> down<00:03:10.520> three<00:03:10.880> frets<00:03:11.920> jump

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
threats and jump down three frets jump

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.100 
threats and jump down three frets jump
down<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.250> Fred's<00:03:15.940> that's<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.150> -<00:03:17.420> Fred<00:03:17.660> jumps<00:03:18.020> I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
down to Fred's that's all - Fred jumps I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.320 
down to Fred's that's all - Fred jumps I
think<00:03:18.380> except<00:03:18.860> for<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.190> second<00:03:19.670> jump<00:03:22.330> three

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
think except for the second jump three

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.350 
think except for the second jump three
frets<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.980> only<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.430> second<00:03:28.819> jump<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.150> three

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
frets so only the second jump is three

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:40.870 
frets so only the second jump is three
frets

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.960
