here<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.129> our<00:00:02.310> new<00:00:02.520> 3d<00:00:02.939> printer<00:00:02.970> just

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
here we have our new 3d printer just

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:19.750 
here we have our new 3d printer just
arrived<00:00:06.379> very<00:00:07.379> well<00:00:11.000> goes<00:00:17.930> front<00:00:18.930> platform

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
arrived very well goes front platform

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.290 
arrived very well goes front platform
something<00:00:20.760> we'll<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.029> look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
something we'll have a look at the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.759 
something we'll have a look at the
instructions<00:00:21.779> later<00:00:23.840> we've<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.230> rolls

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
instructions later we've got two rolls

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.320 
instructions later we've got two rolls
of<00:00:27.199> ABS<00:00:28.199> plastic<00:00:28.550> one<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.670> included<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
of ABS plastic one is included when you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.650 
of ABS plastic one is included when you
buy<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.990> other<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:32.149> purchased<00:00:33.149> additional

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:45.029 

and<00:00:36.660> here's<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> actual<00:00:37.079> printer<00:00:37.620> itself

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.709 

and<00:00:46.039> we've<00:00:46.309> also<00:00:46.460> got<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:47.449> is<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.340> plate<00:00:49.340> I

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
and we've also got this is the plate I

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.720 
and we've also got this is the plate I
believe<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> print<00:00:51.289> is<00:00:51.410> Dunham<00:00:51.730> comes

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
believe that the print is Dunham comes

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.939 
believe that the print is Dunham comes
with<00:00:52.879> an<00:00:52.969> SD<00:00:53.059> card<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:59.140> so<00:01:00.140> assumes<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.710> power

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
with an SD card and so assumes the power

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:11.920 
with an SD card and so assumes the power
supply<00:01:05.680> gether<00:01:06.680> with<00:01:06.890> some<00:01:07.700> tools<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:11.299> tool

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
supply gether with some tools and tool

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.730 
supply gether with some tools and tool
kit<00:01:12.170> here<00:01:13.600> USB<00:01:14.600> cable<00:01:17.380> that's<00:01:18.380> everything

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
kit here USB cable that's everything

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.529 
kit here USB cable that's everything
that<00:01:18.770> comes<00:01:19.039> in<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.220> package<00:01:19.340> let's<00:01:20.270> take<00:01:20.509> a

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
that comes in the package let's take a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:37.190 
that comes in the package let's take a
look<00:01:20.750> at<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.929> actual<00:01:21.170> printer<00:01:22.130> itself

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.649 

so<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.320> would<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.680> these<00:01:39.869> lit<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.570> it's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
so this would be these lit so it's

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.060 
so this would be these lit so it's
completely<00:01:44.080> enclosed<00:01:44.530> when<00:01:44.770> you're<00:01:44.890> printing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
completely enclosed when you're printing

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.300 
completely enclosed when you're printing
which<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.490> important<00:01:46.090> for<00:01:46.680> printing<00:01:47.680> with<00:01:47.860> ABS

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
which is important for printing with ABS

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.210 
which is important for printing with ABS
plastic<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.200> want<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.890> keep<00:01:51.039> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
plastic because you want to keep the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.380 
plastic because you want to keep the
temperature<00:01:51.759> high<00:01:52.479> inside<00:01:53.170> as<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.770> ABS<00:01:54.390> will

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
temperature high inside as the ABS will

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.010 
temperature high inside as the ABS will
warp<00:01:55.689> if<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.289> cools<00:01:56.590> too<00:01:56.979> quickly<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.899> you're

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
warp if it cools too quickly if you're

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.539 
warp if it cools too quickly if you're
going<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.200> print<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.500> PLA<00:01:59.950> then<00:02:00.189> that's<00:02:00.340> not

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
going to print with PLA then that's not

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.840 
going to print with PLA then that's not
such<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.789> problem<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.320> have<00:02:05.470> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
such a problem so there we have it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.499 
such a problem so there we have it
we're<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:06.970> flip<00:02:07.750> everything<00:02:08.049> together<00:02:08.200> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
we're just flip everything together and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.289 
we're just flip everything together and
we'll<00:02:10.509> plug<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.910> we'll<00:02:12.910> give<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
we'll plug it in and we'll give it a

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.400 
we'll plug it in and we'll give it a
test<00:02:13.480> print<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.780> are<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.019> printers

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
test print so here we are the printers

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.530 
test print so here we are the printers
printing<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:18.040> took<00:02:18.340> us<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.519> little<00:02:19.060> while<00:02:19.209> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
printing it took us a little while just

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
printing it took us a little while just
to<00:02:19.660> get<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> up<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.350> running<00:02:20.410> had<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> few

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
to get it up and running had a few

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.559 
to get it up and running had a few
problems<00:02:21.930> plus<00:02:22.930> we're<00:02:23.200> plugged<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
problems plus we're plugged in and the

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.380 
problems plus we're plugged in and the
LCD<00:02:25.959> screen<00:02:26.019> flashed<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.489> then<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.760> all

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
LCD screen flashed up and then it all

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.479 
LCD screen flashed up and then it all
went<00:02:28.450> off<00:02:29.850> something<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:32.190> wasn't<00:02:33.190> told

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
went off something that I wasn't told

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.420 
went off something that I wasn't told

and it appeared to blown something so I
actually<00:02:47.650> opened<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.220> up

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
actually opened it up

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.390 
actually opened it up
luckily<00:02:49.030> uh<00:02:49.470> me<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.650> few<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.920> guys<00:02:51.100> here

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
work in their toilet industry so we had

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.830 
work in their toilet industry so we had
an<00:02:53.290> idea<00:02:53.530> what<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.769> look<00:02:53.859> for<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.510> actual

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
an idea what to look for and the actual

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.810 
an idea what to look for and the actual
power<00:02:56.049> supply<00:02:56.410> unit<00:02:56.829> has<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> switch<00:02:57.609> on<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
power supply unit has a switch on the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.500 
power supply unit has a switch on the
side<00:02:58.019> right<00:02:59.049> select<00:02:59.709> leader<00:02:59.920> 110<00:03:00.340> or<00:03:00.459> 220<00:03:00.640> it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
side right select leader 110 or 220 it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.470 
side right select leader 110 or 220 it
had<00:03:01.600> been<00:03:01.690> preset<00:03:02.140> from<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.410> factory<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.480> 110

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
had been preset from the factory to 110

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.690 
had been preset from the factory to 110
they<00:03:04.930> thought<00:03:05.319> we<00:03:05.470> were<00:03:05.560> using<00:03:05.680> 110<00:03:06.250> nearing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
they thought we were using 110 nearing

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.479 
they thought we were using 110 nearing
the<00:03:06.790> Philippines<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:08.280> unfortunately<00:03:09.280> when<00:03:09.400> we

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the Philippines so unfortunately when we

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.210 
the Philippines so unfortunately when we
plugged<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.230> 220<00:03:11.230> outlet<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.799> caused

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
plugged it in to 220 outlet it caused

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.380 
plugged it in to 220 outlet it caused
some<00:03:13.030> problems<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.660> we<00:03:14.850> had<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.940> replace<00:03:16.150> an

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
some problems and we had to replace an

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.590 
some problems and we had to replace an
internal<00:03:16.840> fuse<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.579> contacted<00:03:18.579> Mary<00:03:18.910> well<00:03:19.150> they

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
internal fuse I contacted Mary well they

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.930 
internal fuse I contacted Mary well they
got<00:03:19.750> back<00:03:19.959> very<00:03:20.170> quickly<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.859> apologized<00:03:21.730> for

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
got back very quickly and apologized for

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.309 
got back very quickly and apologized for
the<00:03:22.030> problem<00:03:22.359> luckily<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:22.720> were<00:03:22.840> able<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.079> fix

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
the problem luckily we were able to fix

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.990 
the problem luckily we were able to fix
it<00:03:23.440> ourselves<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:24.489> something<00:03:24.819> certainly

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it ourselves that's something certainly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.800 
it ourselves that's something certainly
to<00:03:25.540> be<00:03:26.049> aware<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:27.090> before<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.359> plug<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> in

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
to be aware of before you plug it in

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.930 
to be aware of before you plug it in
make<00:03:29.620> sure<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.980> you're<00:03:30.130> plugging<00:03:30.370> into<00:03:30.700> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
make sure that you're plugging into the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.250 
make sure that you're plugging into the
correct<00:03:31.540> voltage<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:32.079> voltage<00:03:32.440> increase

correct voltage to voltage increase
by<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.860> fact<00:03:34.129> we<00:03:34.250> were<00:03:34.340> initiated<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:36.200> so

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
by the fact we were initiated to you so

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.110 
by the fact we were initiated to you so
what's<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.920> problems<00:03:37.280> overcome<00:03:37.549> we<00:03:37.879> got<00:03:38.030> it

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
what's that problems overcome we got it

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.570 
what's that problems overcome we got it
set<00:03:38.299> up<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.629> up<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.290> running<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:40.129> unit<00:03:40.400> comes

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
set up and up and running the unit comes

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.630 
set up and up and running the unit comes
with<00:03:40.730> an<00:03:40.940> SD<00:03:41.060> card<00:03:41.950> which<00:03:42.950> has<00:03:43.129> pre-loaded

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
with an SD card which has pre-loaded

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.449 
with an SD card which has pre-loaded
some<00:03:43.849> files<00:03:44.150> on<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.709> we're<00:03:45.980> printing<00:03:46.190> out

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
some files on it so we're printing out

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.780 
some files on it so we're printing out
now<00:03:46.760> one<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.840> demo<00:03:48.500> files<00:03:48.890> which<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.489> a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
now one of the demo files which is a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.880 
now one of the demo files which is a
doll<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.910> currently<00:03:53.569> about<00:03:54.379> 41%

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
doll and it's currently about 41%

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.289 
doll and it's currently about 41%
through<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.640> been<00:03:55.790> running<00:03:56.000> about<00:03:56.239> three

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
through it's been running about three

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.869 
through it's been running about three
hours<00:03:56.810> it's<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.170> relatively<00:03:57.590> large<00:03:57.860> model<00:03:58.310> we

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
hours it's a relatively large model we

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.030 
hours it's a relatively large model we
were<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> little<00:03:59.120> bit<00:03:59.299> of<00:03:59.390> warping<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.769> think

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
were a little bit of warping but I think

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.940 
were a little bit of warping but I think
that's<00:04:01.250> probably<00:04:01.519> down<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.440> heated<00:04:03.769> plate

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
that's probably down to the heated plate

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.100 
that's probably down to the heated plate
not<00:04:04.220> being<00:04:04.459> quite<00:04:04.790> up<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.420> high<00:04:05.930> enough

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
not being quite up to high enough

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.289 
not being quite up to high enough
temperature<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.430> most<00:04:07.610> 3d<00:04:07.940> printers

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
temperature I have the most 3d printers

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.520 
temperature I have the most 3d printers
when<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.540> first<00:04:08.720> get<00:04:08.989> them<00:04:09.170> you're<00:04:09.319> going<00:04:09.440> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
when you first get them you're going to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.170 
when you first get them you're going to
have<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.769> play<00:04:09.950> around<00:04:10.220> with<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.760> find<00:04:11.000> out

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
have to play around with it to find out

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.170 
have to play around with it to find out
what<00:04:11.510> settings<00:04:12.140> work<00:04:12.319> best<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:12.709> you<00:04:12.920> also<00:04:13.879> as

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
what settings work best for you also as

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.740 
what settings work best for you also as
well<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.750> flap<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.530> front<00:04:15.859> which<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.750> held

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
well the flap on the front which is held

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.400 
well the flap on the front which is held
closed<00:04:18.019> by<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.229> magnet<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.850> magnet<00:04:20.720> which<00:04:21.199> was

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
closed by a magnet the magnet which was

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.870 
closed by a magnet the magnet which was
stuck<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.160> actual<00:04:23.080> enclosure<00:04:24.880> lost

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
stuck on to the actual enclosure lost

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.710 
stuck on to the actual enclosure lost
its<00:04:26.090> adhesiveness

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
its adhesiveness

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960 
its adhesiveness
and<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.470> flap<00:04:27.680> open<00:04:27.860> partway<00:04:28.340> from<00:04:28.610> printing

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and the flap open partway from printing

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.300 
and the flap open partway from printing
and<00:04:29.090> allowed<00:04:29.240> me<00:04:29.510> some<00:04:29.780> coal<00:04:29.990> bearing<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:30.949> I've

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and allowed me some coal bearing so I've

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.909 
and allowed me some coal bearing so I've
just<00:04:31.370> remedied<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:32.060> by<00:04:32.350> gluing<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.620> with

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
just remedied that by gluing it on with

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.659 
just remedied that by gluing it on with
some<00:04:34.160> slightly<00:04:34.520> stronger<00:04:34.760> glue<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.669> overall

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
some slightly stronger glue so overall

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.690 
some slightly stronger glue so overall
so<00:04:38.000> far<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.389> seems<00:04:38.599> like<00:04:39.130> it's<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.280> relatively

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so far it seems like it's a relatively

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.390 
so far it seems like it's a relatively
robust<00:04:41.090> well-made<00:04:41.780> printer<00:04:42.229> but<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.070> know<00:04:43.370> a

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
robust well-made printer but you know a

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.629 
robust well-made printer but you know a
couple<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.789> minor<00:04:44.510> issues<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:46.310> we've<00:04:46.430> managed

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
couple of minor issues but we've managed

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.480 
couple of minor issues but we've managed
to<00:04:46.669> stall<00:04:46.910> those<00:04:47.090> out<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:48.220> we'll<00:04:49.220> see<00:04:49.370> what

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
to stall those out and we'll see what

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.770 
to stall those out and we'll see what
the<00:04:49.550> quality<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:50.000> prints<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.660> another

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
the quality of prints like in another

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.050 
the quality of prints like in another
few<00:04:51.080> hours<00:04:51.380> when<00:04:51.800> it's<00:04:52.250> finished<00:04:52.639> but<00:04:52.880> here's

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
few hours when it's finished but here's

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.490 
few hours when it's finished but here's
what<00:04:53.210> actually<00:04:53.570> came<00:04:53.750> out<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.080> printer

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
what actually came out of the printer

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.250 
what actually came out of the printer
this<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:54.979> supposed<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.250> be<00:04:55.370> our<00:04:55.490> dog<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:57.110> can

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
this is supposed to be our dog you can

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.029 
this is supposed to be our dog you can
see<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.190> is<00:04:59.380> not<00:05:00.380> complete

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
see that it is not complete

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.650 
see that it is not complete
we're<00:05:01.310> missing<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.580> head<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:01.849> a<00:05:01.940> tail<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.180> some

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
we're missing a head and a tail and some

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.890 
we're missing a head and a tail and some
of<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.840> body<00:05:04.030> basically<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:05.240> had<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.389> miss<00:05:05.630> feed

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
of the body basically we had a miss feed

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.400 
of the body basically we had a miss feed
as<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:07.310> was<00:05:07.520> feeding<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.479> plastic<00:05:08.930> in<00:05:09.080> from<00:05:09.320> the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
as it was feeding a plastic in from the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.140 
as it was feeding a plastic in from the
spool<00:05:09.710> at<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:10.010> rear<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:13.400> plastic<00:05:13.849> somehow

spool at the rear the plastic somehow

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.830 
spool at the rear the plastic somehow
got<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:15.070> crossed<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> spool<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.570> jammed

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
got a crossed on the spool and it jammed

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.580 
got a crossed on the spool and it jammed
and<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.169> stopped<00:05:18.950> feeding<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:20.110> six<00:05:21.110> hours<00:05:21.410> in

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
and it stopped feeding so six hours in

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.210 
and it stopped feeding so six hours in
almost<00:05:22.550> there<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.650> that's<00:05:24.650> what<00:05:24.830> happened

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
almost there and that's what happened

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.629 
almost there and that's what happened
running<00:05:25.550> in<00:05:25.700> here<00:05:26.060> is<00:05:27.039> another<00:05:28.039> object<00:05:28.550> this

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
running in here is another object this

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.240 
running in here is another object this
one<00:05:28.849> is<00:05:28.910> going<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.060> be<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.660> little<00:05:30.250> smaller

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
one is going to be a little smaller

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.360 
one is going to be a little smaller
easier<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.849> print<00:05:32.090> it's<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.539> a<00:05:32.630> coin<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:34.250> be

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
easier the print it's just a coin so be

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.730 
easier the print it's just a coin so be
a<00:05:34.400> quicker<00:05:34.669> test<00:05:35.000> was<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.389> do<00:05:35.539> so<00:05:36.320> at<00:05:36.500> least<00:05:36.560> we

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
a quicker test was to do so at least we

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.300 
a quicker test was to do so at least we
can<00:05:36.860> complete<00:05:37.520> something<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.150> show<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:39.310> how

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
can complete something and show you how

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.490 
can complete something and show you how
it<00:05:40.460> looks<00:05:40.490> so<00:05:41.479> there<00:05:41.659> it<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:41.870> printing<00:05:42.289> away

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
it looks so there it is printing away

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.420 
it looks so there it is printing away
right<00:05:42.770> now

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
right now

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.020 
right now
and<00:05:43.790> see<00:05:44.000> there's<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.300> queen<00:05:45.229> shape<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.680> there

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
and see there's a queen shape in there

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.010 
and see there's a queen shape in there
we'll<00:05:47.030> take<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.210> look<00:05:47.389> at<00:05:47.479> it<00:05:47.600> when<00:05:47.840> it's

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
we'll take a look at it when it's

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.500 
we'll take a look at it when it's
finished<00:05:48.410> in<00:05:48.620> another<00:05:48.940> few<00:05:49.940> moments<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.360> can

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
finished in another few moments you can

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.469 
finished in another few moments you can
see<00:05:50.780> over<00:05:51.740> here<00:05:51.770> on<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.280> readout<00:05:52.610> we're

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
see over here on the readout we're

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.550 
see over here on the readout we're
currently<00:05:54.160> 71%<00:05:55.160> through<00:05:57.430> 72%<00:05:58.430> through<00:05:58.699> now

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
currently 71% through 72% through now

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:11.590
