00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
at the same time I think it has too much

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.540 
at the same time I think it has too much
going<00:05:16.449> on<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:17.860> too<00:05:17.979> many<00:05:18.130> things<00:05:18.220> in

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
going on like just too many things in

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.520 
going on like just too many things in
the<00:05:18.639> way<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:21.660> two-story<00:05:22.660> thing<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.290> me<00:05:23.410> is

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the way and the two-story thing to me is

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.640 
the way and the two-story thing to me is
unnecessary<00:05:24.190> is<00:05:25.260> like<00:05:26.260> they<00:05:26.380> could<00:05:26.530> have<00:05:26.620> done

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
unnecessary is like they could have done

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.230 
unnecessary is like they could have done
without<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.070> bottom<00:05:27.400> part<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.880> maybe<00:05:28.120> they

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
without the bottom part or maybe they

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.640 
without the bottom part or maybe they
could<00:05:28.360> have<00:05:28.479> done<00:05:28.510> without<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.900> top<00:05:29.080> part<00:05:29.410> but

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
could have done without the top part but

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.400 
could have done without the top part but
that's<00:05:29.919> just<00:05:30.040> my<00:05:30.190> personal<00:05:30.610> opinion<00:05:31.410> feel
