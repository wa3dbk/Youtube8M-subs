00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome to waiting for battenfeld line 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 episode number 3 today guys 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.450
 along with I had to see one of the two 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.160
 new ways they have been 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 introduced in live beats 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.809
 I'm talking about uruguay 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.000
 Well first of all what is it to implement is one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.960
 conquest a little revolutionized below 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 certain aspects because normally 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 conquest we are used to hold the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 control of certain portions of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
 vaffa in order that our team 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 holds the control of a certain person 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.179
 goal doing so if our team 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.219
 kept her more goals 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 normally should also continue 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 win all this in implementation comes 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.010
 a little repurposed under a new key 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 because the goal 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.969
 the portion of the map we should 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 to hold will no longer be a zone 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.489
 so a mass map of a vehicle 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 we should take control of a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.559
 beak 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.270
 but this will not be enough because 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.399
 to make our team have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 that goal where but what to keep 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 a certain cruising speed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 inside the machine 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.059
 so all this leads us to the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 card to see a fast mode 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.570
 dynamics in which there will be numerous 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.789
 chases this because why 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.500
 logically having to be in the car and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.180
 in continuous movement there are but for the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.619
 of pursuits with us we will try to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150
 escape from our adversaries while 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 opponents will follow us so we can 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.159
 destroy the vehicle so as to slow down 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.470
 our race and prevent us from being able to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.520
 continue to hold control 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the objective then on the card the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.290
 novelty really beautiful service is so 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.869
 even the game the answer is according to you 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.790
 what is the answer yes no 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 what do you think you have there too 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 played those you can even so hot 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.640
 the answer yes or no here in the comments not 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 think of it this way 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.610
 imagine you played there you know 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 you haven't played the answer yet 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 imagine you didn't conquer with the following 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.869
 how can it be cool or not yes no 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.250
 what perfect comments now gay pride 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.420
 your time to respond to what 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 I realized I give you my answer 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.250
 I think it is cool to balance the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 novelty is really beautiful I must say that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.900
 in his also a little and original 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 certainly maybe compared to ace e 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.780
 much more original with mode 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 especially within a beats 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.580
 community so that I remember was not yes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.630
 sa has never been present I must say 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.210
 which I also liked a lot 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 especially 6 played with at least one 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.880
 friend because all you need is a friend in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.730
 team with which you coordinate a little 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 he drives or you drive while one 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.760
 sparkle not vice versa I am a guide 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.140
 the atmosphere one shot at another uil a 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.750
 just let someone guide the damn thing 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.310
 half of fun destinations with him says oh 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.870
 the fuck is chasing us crush it 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.790
 oscar and gets cool ie I don't know 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.360
 I saw amused playing with it and I think 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.430
 this is I hope is that I can to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.750
 but then all this anyway then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.459
 it also presents the problem of sunshine 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.800
 we will go to see in the aspect of the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.400
 fun after new with 100 and praise 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.140
 with the idea as well it is altogether a must 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.270
 to say here to air is a beautiful way 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 but in all this there is indeed a 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.300
 problem what is this problem 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.400
 think about it maybe some of you 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.720
 he played us during the beta I remember 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 which among other things these videos that pass 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.989
 are in play recorded during the beta 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.570
 not logically recorded gameplay a 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.100
 naked brakes naked for fallen because 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.519
 okay I register that implies naked 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.140
 now a fresh cool nude is yours 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.640
 so back to us we're talking about 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.230
 a problem well this problem is 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.570
 represented by the driving model 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 offered by walter and in general the saga 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.530
 of jokes has always had a model of 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 somewhat questionable guide here 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.560
 especially we talk maybe in the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.450
 collisions when even the two means 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.130
 allies or enemies were approaching 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.220
 away with the effect of been sent of 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.960
 a little friction 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.060
 which is annoying that made driving 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.930
 uncontrollable little disturbed 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.310
 enjoyable 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.840
 well this problem reappears 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 inside me battlefield lane 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.500
 I expected the mode like this 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.360
 maybe he could count on one 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.610
 global review of the system 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.280
 guide for example first of all we know 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.410
 all that electronics discount from his 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.180
 many video game development studios 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.010
 I thought maybe they could 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.810
 alongside the visceral games some 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.340
 I study some expert who gave some 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.810
 Minister's advice to improve 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.840
 overall with the guidance system 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.760
 umberto from bacteria from bat pasticche or to 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.050
 air was not only on paper 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.090
 a fun quality but also 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.610
 overall a successful new feature 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.350
 this happens today is simply in 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.480
 part because driving model still a 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.550
 sore point for charity overall 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.200
 of a match maybe we'll complain about 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.510
 all this only once or twice 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.980
 however, this problem exists and could exist 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.019
 also a portal for example also 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.660
 only sometimes maybe before one 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.940
 ramp to launch towards to overcome a 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.710
 muretto sometimes even just one 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.200
 small step before a small one 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.450
 depression sometimes happened during 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.910
 the game of radars and all cannati 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.680
 set at 90 kilometers per hour 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.110
 the machine suddenly stops 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.850
 that is, as if it were printed against a 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.680
 wall because that subscription has 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.590
 miraculously prevented from the machine 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.630
 to proceed things of the high way ie 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.550
 I like this coin, though 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.990
 on the talbot and ristis guide you will do 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.770
 feel especially imagine that 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.840
 art 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.879
 in the mode we may find ourselves a 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.800
 ram the enemy vehicle and when 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:59.300
 this will happen we will see how it will be a little 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.789
 questionable going to approach the scene 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 a little state of friction 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.729
 a miraculous discount between the vehicles 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.400
 misdemeanor 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.229
 here maybe if we had even introduced 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.220
 a well-revised driving system 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.110
 mode would have really been 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.120
 perfect i think i could have 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.370
 really spend many hours with 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.629
 I will enjoy this problem 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.889
 but maybe I'll be aware that yes 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.229
 could have done better 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.300
 and you sick minds because you lie sick 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.009
 okay and you sick minds what 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.659
 think of this mode a question 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.220
 revolt is those people who have 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.750
 made the beta for those people who 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.909
 have seen maybe talk about this 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.900
 unit has quickly in this video 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.940
 leave me below yours 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.199
 considerations so I'm looking forward to 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.120
 read your comments 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.530
 I remind you I recommend leaving 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.539
 even a nice thumb no 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.280
 insert this video before closing it e 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.659
 I as usual are tied 90 bearing 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.879
 for your kind attention there 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.650
 we catch which with the next videos for 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.650
 don't miss and write hello
