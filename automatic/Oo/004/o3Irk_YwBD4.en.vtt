00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.180
 on the galaxy s 6 and the sensor 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 digital printing has been enhanced to 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.430
 register and start using it between 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.650
 applications and go to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.650
 block screen and security in personnel 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.680
 here and access the fingerprint and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 safety 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.890
 now touch add print 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.989
 digital 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
 when you add your fingerprint to the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.300
 the first time it will be necessary to accept 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.580
 terms and conditions 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 so start by putting your finger on the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.800
 start and raise do it several 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.989
 times from different angles and points 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 so that the device can identify the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.210
 maximum of your digital 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 thus increasing accuracy as soon as 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.089
 complete the digital registration process 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.159
 you will need to create a dbk password this 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.049
 password is important because it will be the only 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.049
 way to unlock your device without 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.909
 use of digital therefore in itself a password 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.700
 which you might remember or at night in 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.469
 someplace safe 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 after entering the password confirmed again 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.700
 and touch 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 now the machine will ask you if you 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.409
 want to enable the screen lock by 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.159
 touch to activate it on your 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.140
 device is already configured 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 See how fast you do not even have to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.329
 even connect until simply press the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.340
 start button quickly and release the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.619
 device will unlock to return to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.079
 the settings to digital the device 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.890
 now ask your digital to access 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.810
 this area here you can add 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 other fingerprints for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.259
 unlock the device 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.840
 so you can unlock the device 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.240
 with other fingers or register other 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.859
 people to get access to your galaxy s 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 6 this function and ask if you 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.869
 want to save the password for the sites you 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 trying to access will just populate them 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.280
 if you insert your digital 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.590
 thus changing the need to type 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 your password by just touching your finger on the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 start screen 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.650
 below you can also activate the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.739
 verification 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 the samsung account by digital but for 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.769
 this will need to be confirmed again 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.269
 just so you do not need it 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.420
 plus enter the password for your account 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.290
 samsung to confirm it again 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.540
 just use digital 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.209
 another very useful function is to edit 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 touching edit here you can select 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.799
 a digital fingerprint and renamed to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.290
 keep track of which digital 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.939
 are registered very useful for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.099
 register the impressions of other 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.170
 people in maintaining control over which 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.480
 are yours 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.220
 here you can also exclude 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.190
 fingerprints 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.549
 it is enough to relate it and to remove 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.439
 and confirm the removal if you delete 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.900
 all fingerprints 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.900
 the shape moved back to slide
