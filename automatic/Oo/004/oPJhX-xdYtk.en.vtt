now we're going to look at how you put
the<00:00:14.430> sb900<00:00:15.430> in<00:00:15.550> master<00:00:16.000> mode<00:00:16.030> to<00:00:16.450> use<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.720> as

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
the sb900 in master mode to use it as

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.230

the commander the master flash in a
multi<00:00:19.540> flash<00:00:19.810> setup<00:00:20.230> where<00:00:20.800> we're<00:00:20.920> using

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
multi flash setup where we're using

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.680 
multi flash setup where we're using
through<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.550> lens<00:00:21.700> metering<00:00:21.940> in<00:00:22.300> our<00:00:22.450> case

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
through the lens metering in our case

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.510 
through the lens metering in our case
we're<00:00:22.930> going<00:00:23.080> to<00:00:23.170> use<00:00:23.290> one<00:00:23.560> remote<00:00:23.860> flash<00:00:24.190> and

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
we're going to use one remote flash and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.280 
we're going to use one remote flash and
one<00:00:24.880> master<00:00:25.300> flash<00:00:25.510> with<00:00:25.869> through<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.140> lens

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
one master flash with through the lens

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.720 
one master flash with through the lens
metering<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.010> shooting<00:00:27.310> you'll<00:00:27.460> see

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
metering and the shooting you'll see

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.120 
metering and the shooting you'll see
you'll<00:00:28.480> see<00:00:28.570> it's<00:00:28.779> doing<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:29.080> little<00:00:29.290> while<00:00:29.439> so

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
