00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
over here at the other store the woman

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.970 
over here at the other store the woman
wouldn't<00:03:11.870> take<00:03:12.049> him<00:03:12.170> actually<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> first

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
wouldn't take him actually the first

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.920 
wouldn't take him actually the first
coupon<00:03:13.459> scans<00:03:13.820> just<00:03:14.090> fine<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.690> wouldn't

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
coupon scans just fine and it wouldn't

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.470 
coupon scans just fine and it wouldn't
take<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.200> second<00:03:15.560> one<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> actually<00:03:17.330> I'm

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
take the second one so actually I'm

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.240 
take the second one so actually I'm
thinking<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:17.989> maybe<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.769> had<00:03:18.890> bought<00:03:19.070> them

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
thinking that maybe if I had bought them

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.410 
thinking that maybe if I had bought them
separately<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.850> would<00:03:19.880> have<00:03:20.060> done<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.299> maybe

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
separately it would have done it maybe

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.870 
separately it would have done it maybe
it<00:03:20.630> just<00:03:20.660> didn't<00:03:20.989> like<00:03:21.080> that<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.320> was<00:03:21.500> using<00:03:21.650> to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880
