tells a story like all assessments it

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.950 
tells a story like all assessments it
tells<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.780> story<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:15.340> know<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:16.060> our<00:01:16.509> teachers

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
tells a story we know that our teachers

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.029 
tells a story we know that our teachers
and<00:01:17.319> our<00:01:17.470> parents<00:01:18.159> want<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:20.500> tangible

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
and our parents want to have a tangible

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.880 
and our parents want to have a tangible
way<00:01:21.429> of<00:01:21.729> looking<00:01:22.119> at<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.990> progress<00:01:23.619> that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
way of looking at the progress that

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.950 
way of looking at the progress that
their<00:01:24.220> students<00:01:24.670> are<00:01:24.789> making<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:25.539> we<00:01:25.690> know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
their students are making and so we know

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.559 
their students are making and so we know
that<00:01:25.990> standardized<00:01:26.890> tests<00:01:27.340> are<00:01:27.429> important

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.969 

and<00:01:31.569> I<00:01:31.840> think<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.229> it's<00:01:32.350> important<00:01:32.950> for

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
and I think that it's important for

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.029 
and I think that it's important for
private<00:01:33.520> schools<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.539> be<00:01:34.690> included<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.710> what's

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
private schools to be included in what's

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.070 
private schools to be included in what's
going<00:01:36.340> on<00:01:36.490> nationally<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.330> think<00:01:37.479> parents<00:01:37.959> are

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
going on nationally I think parents are

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.559 
going on nationally I think parents are
hungry<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.679> they<00:01:39.009> want<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.580> know<00:01:39.819> how<00:01:40.539> our

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
hungry for it they want to know how our

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.120 
hungry for it they want to know how our
children<00:01:41.229> are<00:01:41.350> doing<00:01:41.590> with<00:01:41.709> other<00:01:41.830> children

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
children are doing with other children

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.040 
children are doing with other children
across<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.700> nation

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
across the nation

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.660 
across the nation
I<00:01:47.620> think<00:01:48.620> it's<00:01:48.740> important<00:01:49.190> for<00:01:49.220> private

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
I think it's important for private

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.060 
I think it's important for private
schools<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.030> participate<00:01:50.180> in<00:01:50.750> nape<00:01:51.070> because

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
schools to participate in nape because

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.130 
schools to participate in nape because
it<00:01:52.790> gives<00:01:53.090> students<00:01:53.450> an<00:01:53.630> opportunity<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
it gives students an opportunity to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.630 
it gives students an opportunity to
participate<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.950> national<00:01:55.130> assessment

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
participate in a national assessment

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.540 
participate in a national assessment
another<00:01:56.600> reason<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.340> private<00:01:58.340> schools

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
another reason that private schools

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.520 
another reason that private schools
should<00:01:58.700> probably<00:01:58.910> participate<00:01:59.780> in<00:01:59.960> nape<00:02:00.290> is

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
should probably participate in nape is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.860 
should probably participate in nape is
because<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.340> want<00:02:01.520> valid<00:02:01.790> results<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.330> if

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
because you want valid results and if

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.900 
because you want valid results and if
you're<00:02:02.990> leaving<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.530> population<00:02:04.250> you're

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
you're leaving out a population you're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.150 
you're leaving out a population you're
not<00:02:05.090> really<00:02:05.300> getting<00:02:05.540> valid<00:02:05.870> results<00:02:06.230> if<00:02:06.740> all

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
not really getting valid results if all

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.910 
not really getting valid results if all
you<00:02:07.490> did<00:02:07.730> was<00:02:08.230> private<00:02:09.230> schools<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.650> wouldn't

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you did was private schools you wouldn't

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.010 
you did was private schools you wouldn't
have<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.070> very<00:02:10.580> good<00:02:10.790> sampling<00:02:11.510> if<00:02:11.630> all<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.870> did

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
have a very good sampling if all you did

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.690 
have a very good sampling if all you did
was<00:02:12.050> public<00:02:12.470> schools<00:02:12.710> or<00:02:12.890> suburban<00:02:13.430> schools

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
was public schools or suburban schools

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.670 
was public schools or suburban schools
or<00:02:13.880> urban<00:02:14.210> schools<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:15.080> wouldn't<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.650> a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
or urban schools you wouldn't have a

responsible as citizens and I think that
this<00:02:27.110> was<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> great<00:02:27.530> way<00:02:27.740> for<00:02:27.770> my<00:02:28.280> students<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
this was a great way for my students to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
this was a great way for my students to
feel<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.480> they're<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> part<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.260> something

feel that they're a part of something

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.250 
feel that they're a part of something
that's<00:02:30.980> bigger<00:02:31.580> than<00:02:32.300> themselves

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
that's bigger than themselves

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.740 
that's bigger than themselves
