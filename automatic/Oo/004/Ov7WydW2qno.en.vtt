00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.160
 hi in this lesson we will talk about 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.430
 breathing get any sound 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.440
 from the flute is not a difficult undertaking 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.809
 however to get a good sound 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.379
 defined and controlled in height 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.500
 in the dynamics in the timbre and an issue 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.930
 stable continuous it is necessary to develop 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.930
 some breathing control skills 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 which include all the phases of the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.370
 breathing 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.469
 since blowing is not an action 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.850
 vital and is almost quite rare in the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.369
 our daily life 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.610
 usually we don't fill in the way 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.119
 best lungs cvg give and we push 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.800
 out of the air with great impetus 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.830
 uncontrolled the two phases of the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.140
 breathing are the inspiration and 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.229
 inspiration 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.750
 inspiration is a very rapid phase yes 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.210
 runs through the mouth filling the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.170
 lungs of air in a very short time 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.770
 but in a natural and silent way one must 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.009
 avoid shoulder movement when 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.550
 one breathes only the rib cage yes 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.340
 he must dilate inspiration without it 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.970
 overdo it so as not to cause an excess 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 air 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.200
 there are three types of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 for action the average inspiration is the most 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 used requires an air intake of 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.990
 slightly higher than usual 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 deep inspiration is used 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.539
 when the musical phrase is long 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.180
 duration or great intensity is achieved 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 filling lungs widely 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.920
 the brief inspiration however is 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.440
 a reinforcement inspiration destined to 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.900
 fill a slight vacuum in the lungs in 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.330
 a certain moment in the sentence you use 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.020
 also some fast passages 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.360
 inspiration is a delicate phase since 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.420
 when it is distributed and yes 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 puts the air can depend on the beauty and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.600
 sound quality 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.780
 the emission of the area must begin 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.970
 just finished the inspiration for 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.310
 avoid stiffening of the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.710
 musculature that would lead to a blockage 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.820
 respiratory for breathing 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.430
 deep 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.620
 we must feel that the air comes up 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.280
 to the dome and to the lower part of the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.950
 back 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.980
 with this action the ribs move 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 and expand the chest by doing 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.010
 so that the air penetrates inside the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.100
 diaphragm is a wide and thin band 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.980
 dome-shaped muscle separating 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.800
 the thoracic capita where the heart resides 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.370
 lungs from the abdominal cavity 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 containing the stomach and intestines 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.590
 when diaphragm contracts it lowers e 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.780
 it flattens causing the lungs to ad 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.150
 expand the visible effect 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.430
 extremely is the reaching out of the belly 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.910
 taking the air in this way the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.769
 we can take the maximum amount the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.900
 amount of air must still be 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.380
 proportional to the length of the sentence 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.750
 musical and musical intention in 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.209
 other words if we have to play one 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.430
 short sentence we do n't need 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.980
 overfill the lungs 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.220
 if instead it is a long sentence e 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.380
 with many related notes the inspiration must 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.810
 be profound to allow us to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.750
 arrive comfortably at the end of 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.900
 phrase breathing must be 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.110
 natural and never forced to be the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.820
 as similar as possible to ours 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.980
 normal breathing 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.690
 that 's all for today i hope this 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.080
 lesson will be served to you 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.080
 see you later
