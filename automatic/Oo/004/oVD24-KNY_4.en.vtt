5-pound both continue timer but I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.069 
5-pound both continue timer but I
finally<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:53.539> thick<00:00:54.539> gem<00:00:54.809> wheel<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
finally got when I was thick gem wheel I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
finally got when I was thick gem wheel I
was<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.800> spinning<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.370> gems<00:00:56.579> trying<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> get

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
was just spinning for gems trying to get

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.170 
was just spinning for gems trying to get
spectrum<00:00:57.600> gems<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> thought<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> first

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
spectrum gems so I thought you the first

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
spectrum gems so I thought you the first
like<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.539> kind<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> fun<00:01:01.230> gen<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like it was kind of a fun gen to use it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
like it was kind of a fun gen to use it
shaved<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.180> 2<00:01:03.420> minutes<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:05.010> should

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
shaved about 2 minutes off what should

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.270 
shaved about 2 minutes off what should
took<00:01:05.460> taking<00:01:05.939> me<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.240> 9<00:01:06.510> minutes

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
took taking me about 9 minutes

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
took taking me about 9 minutes
this<00:01:08.280> might<00:01:08.490> ended<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.850> taking<00:01:09.060> me<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:10.200> 7

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this might ended up taking me about 7

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
this might ended up taking me about 7
instead<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.890> little

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
instead so it does make it a little

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.890 
instead so it does make it a little
easier<00:01:14.479> shave<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> was

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
easier shave off some time but it was

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
easier shave off some time but it was
still<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.530> fun<00:01:19.710> fight<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> lot

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
still really fun fight it was a lot

once<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.780> fight<00:02:35.299> which<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.329> was<00:02:36.540> lucky<00:02:36.629> so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
once in this fight which I was lucky so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.619 
once in this fight which I was lucky so
that<00:02:37.079> did<00:02:37.230> not<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.620> any<00:02:37.650> magic<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.579> wanted<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
that did not have any magic I wanted to

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.430 
that did not have any magic I wanted to
get<00:02:39.810> an<00:02:39.930> extra<00:02:40.079> Titan<00:02:40.530> right<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.670> jam<00:02:41.940> instead

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
get an extra Titan right to jam instead

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.569 
get an extra Titan right to jam instead
we're<00:02:43.440> using<00:02:43.590> magic<00:02:44.010> cuz<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.280> don't<00:02:44.340> really

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
we're using magic cuz I don't really

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.789 
we're using magic cuz I don't really
like<00:02:44.760> magic<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.239> don't<00:02:45.269> normally<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.140> it's

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
like magic I don't normally use it it's

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.199 
like magic I don't normally use it it's
only<00:02:47.010> good<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.450> 5:1<00:02:49.290> ratio<00:02:49.379> fights<00:02:49.980> when<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
only good and 5:1 ratio fights when you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.199 
only good and 5:1 ratio fights when you
need<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.450> interrupt<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.170> step<00:02:52.410> back<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
need to interrupt a step back so I

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.530 
need to interrupt a step back so I
instead<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.379> use<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.609> Riddick's<00:02:57.030> ringing

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
instead just use it it Riddick's ringing

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.170 
instead just use it it Riddick's ringing
through<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.959> another<00:02:58.069> Titan<00:02:59.069> break<00:02:59.250> +2<00:02:59.670> just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
through on another Titan break +2 just

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.170 
through on another Titan break +2 just
allows<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.079> get<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.590> few<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:02.730> hip<00:03:02.940> horns

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
allows you to get a few more hip horns

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.500 
allows you to get a few more hip horns
in<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:08.250> gonna<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.549> do<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:09.209> bit

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in you're gonna have to do a little bit

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
in you're gonna have to do a little bit
more<00:03:09.540> parry<00:03:10.410> then<00:03:10.889> you<00:03:11.010> might<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.549> you're

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
more parry then you might do if you're

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.050 
more parry then you might do if you're
using<00:03:11.730> dual<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:15.829> it's<00:03:16.829> not<00:03:17.099> really<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> huge

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
using dual but it's not really a huge

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.990 
using dual but it's not really a huge
deal<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:19.709> can<00:03:19.829> slip<00:03:20.040> dodge<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
deal so we can slip dodge a lot of the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.509 
deal so we can slip dodge a lot of the
attack<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:24.389> if<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:26.069> shouldn't<00:03:26.400> really

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
attack and if you you shouldn't really

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.629 
attack and if you you shouldn't really
never<00:03:26.849> happy<00:03:27.440> your<00:03:28.440> shit<00:03:28.680> up<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.980> didn't<00:03:29.340> as

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.710 
you see allocate any opponents the other
time<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.549> would<00:03:35.669> need<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
time you would need it is if you do that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.360

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
you can block it with the shield but

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.670 
you can block it with the shield but
because<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.299> new<00:03:42.569> game<00:03:42.810> you're<00:03:43.530> gonna

something for me every shield hit so I'd

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.789
