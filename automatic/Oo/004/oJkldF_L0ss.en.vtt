something<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.820> translate<00:01:54.510> into

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
something you can just translate into

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.870 
something you can just translate into
you<00:01:55.050> know<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.230> you<00:01:55.980> can't<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:56.400> four<00:01:56.730> players

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880

doing<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.480> these<00:01:57.570> 1v1<00:01:58.050> builds<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.070> know

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
doing all these 1v1 builds as you know

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.590 
doing all these 1v1 builds as you know
it<00:01:59.400> just<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.820> doesn't<00:01:59.940> work<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.570> well

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it just really doesn't work out so well

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.030 
it just really doesn't work out so well
but<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.350> had<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.590> level<00:02:01.980> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
but when you had this level of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.430 
but when you had this level of
cooperation<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.940> find<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.600> crazy<00:02:04.080> bills

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
cooperation you find really crazy bills

going to be that fantastic position to
put<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:56.459> early<00:03:56.880> pressure<00:03:57.150> likely<00:03:58.139> again<00:03:58.590> on

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
put some early pressure likely again on

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.890 
put some early pressure likely again on
the<00:03:59.010> zerg<00:03:59.220> opponent<00:03:59.700> however<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.510> know<00:04:00.630> if<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
the zerg opponent however you know if it

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.839 
the zerg opponent however you know if it
was<00:04:01.049> like<00:04:01.170> zerg<00:04:01.470> enterin<00:04:01.980> they'd<00:04:02.340> probably<00:04:02.670> or

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
was like zerg enterin they'd probably or

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.339 
was like zerg enterin they'd probably or
if<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.150> was<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:03.389> Protoss<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.079> tear<00:04:04.230> and

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
if it was like Protoss and tear and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.690 
if it was like Protoss and tear and
they're<00:04:04.440> facing<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:04.889> against<00:04:05.220> they<00:04:05.549> would

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
they're facing up against they would

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.670 
they're facing up against they would
probably<00:04:06.030> honestly<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.230> Protoss

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
probably honestly go for the Protoss

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.550 
probably honestly go for the Protoss
because<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:09.150> know<00:04:09.269> obviously<00:04:09.319> hellions<00:04:10.319> can

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
because you know obviously hellions can

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.140 
because you know obviously hellions can
just<00:04:10.709> out<00:04:10.859> range<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.400> zealot<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.880> burn

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
just out range the zealot in to burn

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.539 
just out range the zealot in to burn
down<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.690> little<00:04:12.950> burned<00:04:13.950> down<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.340> wall

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
down that little burned down that wall

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.690 
down that little burned down that wall
from<00:04:14.790> afar<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.530> deal<00:04:16.530> quite<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.579> damage

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
from afar and deal quite a bit of damage

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.580 
from afar and deal quite a bit of damage
now<00:04:18.209> what<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.599> think<00:04:18.930> these<00:04:19.019> Hellas<00:04:19.380> are<00:04:19.470> going

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
now what I think these Hellas are going

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.229 
now what I think these Hellas are going
to<00:04:19.650> be<00:04:19.709> looking<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.950> do<00:04:20.130> here<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.549> try<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
to be looking to do here is try to

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.230 
to be looking to do here is try to
engage<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.139> gauge<00:04:22.919> alongside<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:24.000> zerglings

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
engage the gauge alongside the zerglings

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.300 
engage the gauge alongside the zerglings
because<00:04:25.139> when<00:04:25.440> zerglings<00:04:25.889> fight<00:04:26.130> other

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
because when zerglings fight other

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.159 
because when zerglings fight other
circlings<00:04:26.789> you<00:04:26.849> had<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.150> giant<00:04:27.570> wall<00:04:27.960> where

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
circlings you had this giant wall where

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.140 
circlings you had this giant wall where
it's<00:04:28.289> basically<00:04:28.500> one<00:04:28.830> group<00:04:29.130> here<00:04:29.340> one<00:04:29.940> group

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
it's basically one group here one group

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.200 
it's basically one group here one group
here<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.599> then<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
here and then the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.520 
here and then the
we'll<00:04:31.479> be<00:04:31.539> able<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.720> come<00:04:31.900> out<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.289> side

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
we'll be able to come out to the side

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.040 
we'll be able to come out to the side
and<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:33.280> get<00:04:33.490> perfect<00:04:34.030> lineups<00:04:34.419> but<00:04:34.780> we<00:04:34.900> are

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
and just get perfect lineups but we are

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.360 
and just get perfect lineups but we are
going<00:04:35.199> to<00:04:35.259> see<00:04:35.380> those<00:04:35.500> helmets<00:04:35.710> annihilate

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
going to see those helmets annihilate

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.529 
going to see those helmets annihilate
the<00:04:36.460> mineral<00:04:36.759> line<00:04:36.880> they're<00:04:37.060> only<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.330> couple

the mineral line they're only a couple

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.730 
the mineral line they're only a couple

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
him to basically by a little bit of time

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.339 
him to basically by a little bit of time
but<00:04:54.729> notice<00:04:55.060> how<00:04:55.090> axel<00:04:55.630> has<00:04:55.810> transitioned

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
but notice how axel has transitioned

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.339 
but notice how axel has transitioned
into<00:04:56.710> Marauders<00:04:57.460> now<00:04:57.699> very<00:04:58.419> smart<00:04:58.960> move<00:04:59.169> i

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
into Marauders now very smart move i

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.710 
into Marauders now very smart move i
think<00:04:59.620> he<00:04:59.770> realizes<00:05:00.160> okay<00:05:00.699> by<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.210> time<00:05:01.509> we

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
think he realizes okay by the time we

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.600 
think he realizes okay by the time we
finish<00:05:02.050> up<00:05:02.259> this<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.770> know<00:05:02.919> this<00:05:03.190> whole<00:05:03.250> deal

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
finish up this you know this whole deal

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.180 
finish up this you know this whole deal
Oh<00:05:04.080> forcefield<00:05:05.080> misplaced<00:05:05.590> right<00:05:05.830> there<00:05:06.039> that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
Oh forcefield misplaced right there that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.219 
Oh forcefield misplaced right there that
is<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.370> huge<00:05:06.729> blunder<00:05:07.150> then<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.780> could<00:05:08.020> actually

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
is a huge blunder then it could actually

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.469 
is a huge blunder then it could actually
cost<00:05:08.680> him<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:08.919> ramp<00:05:09.310> right<00:05:09.550> there<00:05:09.729> as<00:05:09.849> all<00:05:10.300> of

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
cost him the ramp right there as all of

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.089 
cost him the ramp right there as all of
these<00:05:10.599> forces<00:05:10.870> are<00:05:11.050> able<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.500> work<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.800> taking

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
these forces are able to work on taking

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.310 
these forces are able to work on taking
out<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.699> cybernetics<00:05:13.330> core<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.720> few<00:05:14.020> certain

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
out this cybernetics core a few certain

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.990 
out this cybernetics core a few certain
things<00:05:14.440> coming<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.830> here<00:05:14.979> as<00:05:15.130> well<00:05:15.340> keeping

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
things coming in here as well keeping

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.540 
things coming in here as well keeping
the<00:05:16.090> Protoss<00:05:16.449> on<00:05:16.660> his<00:05:16.810> toes<00:05:17.050> he<00:05:17.830> has<00:05:18.070> lost<00:05:18.370> his

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the Protoss on his toes he has lost his

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.279 
the Protoss on his toes he has lost his
centuries<00:05:19.090> now<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:19.570> really<00:05:19.900> it's<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.139> a

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
centuries now so really it's just a

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.469 
centuries now so really it's just a
matter<00:05:20.470> of<00:05:20.590> time<00:05:20.770> we<00:05:21.310> do<00:05:21.490> have<00:05:21.669> blank<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
matter of time we do have blank on the

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.540 
matter of time we do have blank on the
way<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.960> could<00:05:23.470> help<00:05:23.680> out<00:05:23.800> a<00:05:23.860> little<00:05:24.159> bit<00:05:24.400> but

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
way it could help out a little bit but

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.219 
way it could help out a little bit but
again<00:05:24.820> losing<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.330> cybernetics<00:05:25.870> core<00:05:26.080> is

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
again losing the cybernetics core is

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.770 
again losing the cybernetics core is
gonna<00:05:26.650> really<00:05:27.220> make<00:05:27.550> these<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:28.539> know<00:05:28.630> this

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
gonna really make these you know this

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.990 
gonna really make these you know this
blink<00:05:29.110> pretty<00:05:29.800> much<00:05:29.919> just<00:05:30.069> useless<00:05:30.460> until<00:05:30.819> he

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
blink pretty much just useless until he

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.969 
blink pretty much just useless until he
gets<00:05:31.150> another<00:05:31.449> one<00:05:31.630> up<00:05:31.840> because<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.710> see<00:05:32.830> he

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
gets another one up because you see he

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.129 
gets another one up because you see he
does<00:05:33.159> have<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.430> up<00:05:33.520> now<00:05:33.639> these<00:05:34.000> basically<00:05:34.750> just

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
does have it up now these basically just

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.499 
does have it up now these basically just
a<00:05:35.259> few<00:05:35.530> stalkers<00:05:35.800> that's<00:05:36.250> about<00:05:36.669> it<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:37.360> that

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
a few stalkers that's about it so that

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.960 
a few stalkers that's about it so that
blink<00:05:37.840> tech<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.289> going<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:38.590> be<00:05:38.710> in<00:05:39.039> terms<00:05:39.789> of

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
blink tech is going to be in terms of

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.920 
blink tech is going to be in terms of
effectiveness<00:05:40.419> limited<00:05:41.139> at<00:05:41.320> best<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:43.060> great

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
effectiveness limited at best so great

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.450 
effectiveness limited at best so great

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
hit there without even knowing that that

Twilight<00:05:45.849> Council<00:05:46.210> is<00:05:46.330> on<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:46.570> way<00:05:46.690> but<00:05:47.050> now

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
Twilight Council is on the way but now

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.659 
Twilight Council is on the way but now
the<00:05:47.289> mineral<00:05:47.770> line<00:05:47.889> is<00:05:48.070> going<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.250> be<00:05:48.340> taken

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
the mineral line is going to be taken

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.640 
the mineral line is going to be taken
out<00:05:48.789> there<00:05:48.969> you're<00:05:49.120> seeing<00:05:49.389> that<00:05:49.750> Tosh<00:05:50.020> tried

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
out there you're seeing that Tosh tried

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.070 
out there you're seeing that Tosh tried
to<00:05:50.800> clog<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.310> up<00:05:51.430> keep<00:05:51.909> those<00:05:52.180> hellions<00:05:52.509> away

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
to clog it up keep those hellions away

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.629 
to clog it up keep those hellions away
but<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.560> think<00:05:53.830> you<00:05:53.919> just<00:05:54.070> put<00:05:54.280> them<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.430> little

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
but I think you just put them a little

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.370 
but I think you just put them a little
bit<00:05:54.789> too<00:05:54.969> close<00:05:55.240> there<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.960> lot<00:05:56.139> of<00:05:56.199> that

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
bit too close there and a lot of that

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.409 
bit too close there and a lot of that
splash<00:05:56.740> was<00:05:57.009> feeding<00:05:57.460> office<00:05:57.820> behind<00:05:58.090> the

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
splash was feeding office behind the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.870 
splash was feeding office behind the
stalkers<00:05:58.810> into<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.680> probe<00:05:59.919> line<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.430> now<00:06:00.820> you

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
stalkers into the probe line and now you

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.149 
stalkers into the probe line and now you
have<00:06:01.150> what<00:06:01.449> you<00:06:01.570> see<00:06:01.780> here<00:06:02.080> which<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.710> going<00:06:03.099> to

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
have what you see here which is going to

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.980 
have what you see here which is going to
be<00:06:03.219> a<00:06:03.310> GG<00:06:03.849> at<00:06:04.030> some<00:06:04.330> point<00:06:04.570> in<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:04.780> near<00:06:04.930> future

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
be a GG at some point in the near future

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.469 
be a GG at some point in the near future

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
match but that one would definitely not

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.430 
match but that one would definitely not
be<00:06:15.969> me<00:06:16.270> I<00:06:16.479> would<00:06:16.630> be<00:06:16.659> the<00:06:16.810> one<00:06:16.840> that<00:06:17.050> says<00:06:17.229> yeah
