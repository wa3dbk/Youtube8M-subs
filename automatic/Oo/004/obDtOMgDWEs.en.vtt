00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a little first of all let's take his

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.770 
a little first of all let's take his
head<00:00:36.420> off<00:00:37.640> okay<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.030> tilt<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.600> up

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
head off okay you want to tilt this up

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
head off okay you want to tilt this up
just<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.739> bit<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just a little bit like that so that the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
just a little bit like that so that the
screwdriver<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.750> straight<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.219> put

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
screwdriver can go in straight so put

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
screwdriver can go in straight so put
them<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> sitting<00:00:45.090> position<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
coin right there and that'll make this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.069 
coin right there and that'll make this
perfectly<00:00:49.530> straight<00:00:50.239> then<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
perfectly straight then you're going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
perfectly straight then you're going to
poke<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> screwdriver<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:53.940> two

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
poke a screwdriver through these two

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
poke a screwdriver through these two
holes<00:00:55.340> okay<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.690> one<00:01:00.800> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
holes okay there you go there's one and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.630 
holes okay there you go there's one and
there's<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.869> once<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
there's the other and once you do that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.960 
there's the other and once you do that
this<00:01:08.640> will<00:01:08.909> tilt<00:01:09.210> back<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:11.119> pop<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:13.070> okay<00:01:14.070> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this will tilt back and pop off okay now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890 
this will tilt back and pop off okay now
you<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.799> these<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:16.860> feet<00:01:17.420> engage<00:01:18.420> down

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you see here these two feet engage down

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
you see here these two feet engage down
here<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.090> then<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.509> screws<00:01:21.780> hold<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here and then these two screws hold it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
here and then these two screws hold it
on<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:22.979> how<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.729> doodad

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
on so that's how that little doodad

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.679 
on so that's how that little doodad
works<00:01:25.070> all<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.390> rest<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
works all right I think the rest is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
works all right I think the rest is
pretty<00:01:27.840> self-explanatory<00:01:28.729> you've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.850> two

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
pretty self-explanatory you've got two

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.289 
pretty self-explanatory you've got two
batteries<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:32.180> there's<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.509> two<00:01:35.299> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
batteries in here so there's one two and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
batteries in here so there's one two and
then<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.900> ahead<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.229> drop<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> new

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
then just go ahead and drop in the new

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.819 
then just go ahead and drop in the new
batteries<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.700> sure<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
batteries make sure that you put the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.990 
batteries make sure that you put the
what<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> plots<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.850> that's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
what is that the plots I think that's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
what is that the plots I think that's
the<00:01:42.150> plus<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:43.259> no<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the plus yeah no that's that's the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
the plus yeah no that's that's the
negative<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.600> plus<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.740> make

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
negative that's the plus so just make

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
negative that's the plus so just make
sure<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> negative<00:01:47.759> side<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.119> first

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
sure you put the negative side in first

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
sure you put the negative side in first
because<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.619> contact

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
because that's going to make contact

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
because that's going to make contact
with<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> spring<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> plus<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
with the spring and then the plus is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.420 
with the spring and then the plus is
going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> make<00:01:52.530> contact<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> side

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
going to make contact with the side

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.240 
going to make contact with the side
there<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:55.200> drop<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.619> new<00:01:55.799> ones<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there and just drop two new ones in

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.910 
there and just drop two new ones in
reverse<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> procedure<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:58.079> putting<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
reverse the procedure by putting this in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.539 
reverse the procedure by putting this in
sorry<00:01:59.880> by<00:02:00.390> putting<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.710> then

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
sorry by putting this in first then

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.149 
sorry by putting this in first then
tilting<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.899> screwing<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
tilting it then screwing it back on and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.749 
tilting it then screwing it back on and
that's<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.719> replace<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> battery<00:02:07.759> good

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that's how you replace the battery good

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's how you replace the battery good
luck
