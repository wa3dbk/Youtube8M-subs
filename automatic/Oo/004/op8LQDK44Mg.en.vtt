00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.590
 the htc one m8 is perhaps the nicest 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.330
 to this year's punishment 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.340
 device was launched in April by 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.290
 htc and we are going to compare with today 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.040
 new device that from 1 July in one 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.369
 country is available 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.630
 of course it is the lg g3 the lg g3 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.919
 the first device that is already for quad 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.289
 HD screen has that in the Netherlands 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.179
 offered is this quad HD screen 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.999
 five and half inches tall and maybe so 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.059
 over a resolution of 2560 times 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.650
 1440 pixels that is particularly high 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.420
 the haas heaven do that with a full hd 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.520
 5-inch screen, and therein lies the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.130
 pixels per inch is lower at the ac 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.710
 than with this lg but what is striking 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.080
 that the screen of this htc really nicer 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.930
 is in terms of color reproduction and color fastness 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.910
 than this lg and with that trump made it 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.790
 the lg a big stick actually the same 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.630
 shot are also nice 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.030
 then this one 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.040
 htc one m8 and is small screen evers what 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.200
 common but the big advantage of it 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.910
 The LG G3 is that it does have a large screen 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.710
 but that has the lands around it 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.269
 screen is actually much smaller than 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.560
 we have at the htc 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.229
 we also find that a very large 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.429
 benefit if go look then on 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.289
 the price then are both devices 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.869
 montil is about the same price 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.789
 both for around and 550 euros online too 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.950
 but chances are that I have the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.560
 will soon fall for both 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.569
 devices as far as to look 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.249
 specifications then it appears that the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.609
 specifications devices are rare 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:29.979
 each other under firstly it ram de 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.659
 lg has 2 gigabytes of ram that 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.979
 the full version that less our hands 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.850
 have a session gigabyte internally 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.139
 memory 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.060
 there is also another variant that 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:38.439
 has digi go cream and 32 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.299
 and gigabyte internal memory 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.310
 50 euros more expensive 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.380
 the htc one m8 has 2 gigabytes in all 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.609
 and also has 16 gigabytes 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.749
 internal memory 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.829
 the advantage for both devices is that 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.159
 nowadays that memory 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.359
 extendable is that well 28 is made 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.399
 both devices also have the 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.529
 qualcomm 801 processor 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.289
 the htc has dab variant that is broken 

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:01.240
 stripes 3 gert and i have got over the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.479
 features the ace variants in this 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.179
 large on two and half richards so the a 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.310
 qualcomm 801 ac serve lg g3 is just 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.780
 somewhat faster than that of the htc but the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.700
 Practice will you relatively little 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.070
 Brands 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 It is also good to know that HIV 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.310
 chose each other again 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 megapixel camera 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 Ultrapixel had to say LG features 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.460
 13 megapixel camera and we have already 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720
 say the room of LG is better 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.610
 from hc 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.830
 HC leaves considerable points for this area 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.020
 In addition, LG has ensured 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 that it then gave auto focus very quickly 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.890
 he has well i use one 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 laser and shoot a laser at the point 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.390
 what here on auto-focus him and thereby 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.490
 take photos of this lg very quickly 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.470
 one with the right focus 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.000
 nice of this out of the ordinary and power is 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.530
 that the front of the device is one 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.690
 better camera has more affection for it 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.370
 need it ourselves, and it is there 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.410
 a few extra settings in the camera 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 menu to create more depth 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.850
 thanks to this by camera of the htc one 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.420
 m8 if you go in practice 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.030
 use 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.350
 that is just the question both 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.760
 devices run on android free point 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.830
 ficq kit cat and they both have theirs 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.650
 own spider more we are very sorry 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.890
 charmed the htc itself in this skin 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.270
 there is quite a neat us this 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.220
 666 point an interface we must say 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.690
 since leslie print and you still have 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.160
 the well-known blinkfeed on the left 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 but the menu itself a lot 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.640
 clearer and he simply sees best 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.630
 neat out 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.459
 then there was also an ugly dropping 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.050
 also use in that area have few 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.820
 to criticize 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.709
 ks also has interface that runs quite 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.690
 improve we will make better now 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.370
 use of colors the icons come 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.870
 now much more over and it will start to look 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.280
 it stands out that everything is a lot nicer 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.420
 actually the looks like being 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.980
 predecessor 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.690
 also in the menu and setting looks like 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 a movie cleaner and also the device 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.720
 runs reasonably fast 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.280
 it is striking that lg sometimes a bit of a nuisance 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.989
 has delays where the htc 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.549
 that has not 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.890
 was a push the question which of these two 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.540
 We would advise you to use appliances 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.310
 to know the two devices just really 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.320
 very good devices can be found 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.510
 we are designing the htc one m8 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.459
 all-aluminum frame particularly beautiful 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.049
 lg use a plastic frame 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.030
 what looks pretty neat b then 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.190
 example a samsung but still gets it 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 the htc of these benefits us 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 we would also say that for days 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.209
 use the htc the better but you go 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.500
 Real mussel specifications make our LG better 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.019
 but the two keys are very close 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.729
 we do think that the lg is a lot 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.260
 has better camera that finds great 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.220
 plus point 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.120
 and next to it is the larger screen 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.979
 naturally beautiful too 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.590
 taken because size of both device 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.790
 has remained almost identical in fact you 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.240
 so have a 5 a half inch screen 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.060
 in front of 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.380
 same price from the htc one m8 so that 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.449
 check flat wind 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.660
 but they certainly do not escape each other 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.660
 a lot of
