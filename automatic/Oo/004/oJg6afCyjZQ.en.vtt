you<00:00:12.540> can<00:00:12.660> see<00:00:12.840> from<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.139> box

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
you can see from the box

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.129 
you can see from the box
this<00:00:14.309> thing's<00:00:14.580> tiny<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.570> looks<00:00:15.750> more<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this thing's tiny it looks more like a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
this thing's tiny it looks more like a
digital<00:00:16.320> camera<00:00:16.770> box<00:00:17.130> than<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> actual

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
digital camera box than a actual

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.390 
digital camera box than a actual
computer<00:00:18.570> box<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.859> put<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> cup<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
computer box so I just put the cup in

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.560 
computer box so I just put the cup in
idea<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.270> tiny<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.519> it's<00:00:23.519> even<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.240> super

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
idea how tiny it is it's even a super

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
idea how tiny it is it's even a super
light<00:00:24.720> weight<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:26.119> can't<00:00:27.119> believe<00:00:27.210> there's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
light weight so I can't believe there's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.120 
light weight so I can't believe there's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
battery now the beauty of this device is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
battery now the beauty of this device is
that<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.420> computer<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> rated<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.649> eight

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that this computer is rated at eight

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
that this computer is rated at eight
hours<00:01:38.280> battery<00:01:39.060> life<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.990> makes<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
hours battery life so that just makes it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
hours battery life so that just makes it
that<00:01:41.280> makes<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.520> great<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.300> get

take a quick look at the PD series
itself<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:32.740> think<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.430> little

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
itself I think it's for this little

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.140 
itself I think it's for this little
thing<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:33.970> tiny<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.590> small<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.880> it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
thing is tiny it's small so that it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.520 
thing is tiny it's small so that it
feels<00:02:37.270> like<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.960> those<00:02:38.050> pocket

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
feels like one of those pocket

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.180 
feels like one of those pocket
dictionaries<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:40.090> about<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.360> same<00:02:40.540> size<00:02:41.190> it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
dictionaries it's about the same size it

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.010 
dictionaries it's about the same size it
I<00:02:42.460> believe<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.390> based<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
I believe this is actually based on the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.830 
I believe this is actually based on the
second<00:02:44.410> generation<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.310> human<00:02:45.730> not<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
second generation of the human not the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.290 
second generation of the human not the
first<00:02:47.080> because<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.590> comes<00:02:47.830> with<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.310> second

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
first because it comes with the second

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300 
first because it comes with the second
generation<00:02:49.540> might<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.410> faster<00:02:50.770> processor

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
generation might have a faster processor

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.670 
generation might have a faster processor
but<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.730> same<00:02:52.420> way<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.140> second<00:02:53.470> gen

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
but it's same way of as the second gen

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.710 
but it's same way of as the second gen
Union<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.210> can<00:02:55.330> see<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.540> have<00:02:55.630> a
