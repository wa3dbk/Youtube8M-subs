 Photoshop video tutorials 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello friends with you kuzmichyov 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 Alexey 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 I continue my favorite topic 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 retouching and photo processing and today 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.240
 I have prepared for you a lesson in which we 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 we will attach this photo here 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 soft and soft tonal so let's 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 let's start by tradition with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.119
 duplication of our main layer 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.620
 press control jay 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 so we get a duplicate further go 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.210
 to point 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 image choose external channel here 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 color for the channel choose the green layer 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 we are united overlay 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.390
 light replacement, select yes or if 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.850
 you English version will be there 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 it is written in your light 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 transparency that press ok see what 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 our photo acquires the same 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.250
 soft delicate shades that's what we had 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 and that's how we have it now looks like this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.150
 Now choose the adjustment layer 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.390
 selective color correction 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.840
 go here to neutral 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 So we set up such nastroechki 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 put 11 on the top window 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 we put 3 with the third window 9 and the last 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.030
 window 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 leave 0 and close this window so 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.130
 What effect should we achieve? 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 yes now let's combine all the visible 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.350
 layers in one for this we clamp 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 combination of 4 keys shift control and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.970
 alt + and so we have a new one 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 merged layer now we go to point 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.689
 filter 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 get out right away washing blur by 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.270
 gauss and blur our images 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.240
 about that much like that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.700
 I'm pretty big photo therefore 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.649
 I chose a radius of 8 pixels you already 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.480
 look depending on your size 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.470
 photos yes so i click ok and now 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.390
 we need 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.450
 blend mode of this layer on soft 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.990
 light so see that contrast photograph 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.150
 on immediately rises sharply but now u 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.490
 we showed up red is on the photo 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.330
 to get rid of them we go to the point 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.290
 image choose correction here and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.110
 now choose color 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.350
 tone saturation 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.860
 select the color red saturation here 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.340
 for him we put minus 100 and the brightness 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.140
 increase to maximum and that's what effect 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 on with you should now succeed 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.340
 click ok now let's add more 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.459
 a little contrast our photo again 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 make a copy of all four layers for 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.880
 press shift shift alt + again 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.570
 I use blur again 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.940
 gauss up 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.880
 again not to go to our point filter 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.400
 and so on just hold down the combination 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.070
 control of to apply the previous one 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.920
 effect yes so see our blur 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.810
 automatically applied and now 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.600
 change the blending mode of this layer also 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.470
 on soft light and lower transparency 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.450
 this layer is somewhere up to 20 percent 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.170
 this way we achieved even more 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.000
 contrast on the photo well we stayed with 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.730
 you are the last final step 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.050
 let's create another corrective 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.170
 layer collection of light so now 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.620
 go to the point of red before we force 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.620
 here the settings in the first window are 86 second 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.360
 window -23 next 12 and 0 now go 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.989
 white shades 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.190
 in the second window we put minus 21 and 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.170
 leave the rest of the window unchanged 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.970
 and so our effect is complete we 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.450
 processed our photo in such 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.420
 gentle 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.299
 pale shades she looks very 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.510
 very creative i think and gives such 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.209
 soft gentle thoughtful effect on your 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.859
 photos and even so 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.959
 Well, I think you will this lesson 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.780
 useful you can apply it on 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.590
