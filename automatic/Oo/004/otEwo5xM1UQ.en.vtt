forever ok so let's first talk about the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
forever ok so let's first talk about the
game<00:01:19.830> mechanics<00:01:20.369> before<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> game<00:01:21.090> if

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
game mechanics before we set the game if

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
game mechanics before we set the game if
you<00:01:21.930> move<00:01:22.080> forward<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.100> decelerated

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you move forward and you decelerated

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
you move forward and you decelerated
normal<00:01:24.030> pace<00:01:24.470> when<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> stop<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.040> stop

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
normal pace when you stop when you stop

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
normal pace when you stop when you stop
pulling<00:01:26.549> forward<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> hit<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.869> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
pulling forward if you hit back then you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
pulling forward if you hit back then you
slow<00:01:28.170> down<00:01:28.290> faster<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.820> however

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
slow down faster if you back up however

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
slow down faster if you back up however
then<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> always<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> constant<00:01:32.579> speed

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
then you always go at a constant speed

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
then you always go at a constant speed
if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.420> let<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.860> stopped

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
if you let go going back you stopped

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
if you let go going back you stopped
instantly<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> hell<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
instantly what the hell is that that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
instantly what the hell is that that
doesn't<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.500> sense<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.360> later<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
game on so i can add in a different

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
game on so i can add in a different
sound<00:01:59.610> track<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.299> since<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.350> music

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
sound track in the back since some music

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.429 
sound track in the back since some music
seems<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.399> game<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
seems to like the game but not for this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.880 
seems to like the game but not for this
one<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.990> working<00:02:07.350> there's<00:02:07.799> no

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

music at all there's no sound there's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.690 
music at all there's no sound there's
nothing<00:02:09.989> there's<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.670> right

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
nothing there's just what you see right

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
nothing there's just what you see right
now<00:02:11.940> you'll<00:02:12.930> notice<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> i'm<00:02:13.349> kind<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
now you'll notice that i'm kind of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
now you'll notice that i'm kind of
wiggle

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
wiggle

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380 
wiggle
around<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:15.240> probably

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
around a bit and you're probably

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.809 
around a bit and you're probably
thinking<00:02:15.630> oh<00:02:15.959> well<00:02:16.200> maybe<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.190> cameras<00:02:17.640> like

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
thinking oh well maybe the cameras like

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.290 
thinking oh well maybe the cameras like
making<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.360> lag<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:18.959> maybe<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.950> game<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> like

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
making it lag or maybe the game it like

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.150 
making it lag or maybe the game it like
his<00:02:21.630> computer<00:02:22.080> can't<00:02:22.290> run<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> properly<00:02:22.980> or

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
his computer can't run it properly or

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.580 
his computer can't run it properly or
something<00:02:23.459> no<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.720> legs<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.319> its<00:02:25.470> own

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
something no it just legs on its own

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
something no it just legs on its own
like<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.190> always<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.880> ya<00:02:27.810> see

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
like this it's always like this ya see

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.990 
like this it's always like this ya see
what<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.290> did<00:02:28.530> there<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.700> went

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
what I just did there I just went

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.090 
what I just did there I just went
through<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> house<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.989> drove<00:02:31.500> through<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
through a house I drove through a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.670 
through a house I drove through a
 house<00:02:32.959> why<00:02:33.959> would<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> put<00:02:34.350> houses

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
 house why would you put houses

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.900 
 house why would you put houses
there<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.220> drive<00:02:35.430> through<00:02:35.700> them

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
there if I can just drive through them

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.850 
there if I can just drive through them
like<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.270> oh<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:37.590> god<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.959> i'm

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
like this oh my god what the i'm

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.270 
like this oh my god what the i'm
driving<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:42.300> doesn't<00:02:42.660> even<00:02:42.840> make<00:02:43.019> sense

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
driving up that doesn't even make sense

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.490 
driving up that doesn't even make sense
there's<00:02:44.280> no<00:02:44.599> like<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.840> don't<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:46.380> it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
there's no like I don't know what it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.290 
there's no like I don't know what it
what<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> problem<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.250> how<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.760> becomes<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
what the problem is how this becomes a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000 
what the problem is how this becomes a
problem<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:49.230> only<00:02:49.350> assume<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.709> maybe

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
problem I can only assume that maybe

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.580 
problem I can only assume that maybe
there's<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.250> no<00:02:50.550> physics<00:02:51.000> engine<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.390> all

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
there's like no physics engine at all

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.720 
there's like no physics engine at all
another<00:02:52.590> thing<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.830> you'll<00:02:53.069> notice<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.489> that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
another thing that you'll notice is that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.880 
another thing that you'll notice is that
when<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.269> get<00:02:54.390> close<00:02:54.630> enough<00:02:54.810> light<00:02:55.590> on

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
when you get close enough light on

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.370 
when you get close enough light on
things<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:57.060> appear<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.720> can<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.170> them

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
things will appear and you can see them

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.759 
things will appear and you can see them
through<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.910> hills<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.660> stuff<00:03:01.260> it's

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
through like the hills and stuff it's

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.910 
through like the hills and stuff it's
just<00:03:02.069> weird<00:03:03.950> damn<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.180> um<00:03:06.350> you'll<00:03:07.350> also<00:03:07.530> see

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
just weird damn it um you'll also see

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.330 
just weird damn it um you'll also see
that<00:03:08.299> parts<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> road<00:03:09.989> will<00:03:10.709> disappear<00:03:11.250> at

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
that parts of the road will disappear at

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.520 
that parts of the road will disappear at
times<00:03:11.370> like<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.880> clip<00:03:12.120> out<00:03:12.299> that's<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.500> show

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
times like the clip out that's to show

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.949 
times like the clip out that's to show
where<00:03:14.340> when<00:03:14.549> you're<00:03:14.700> normally<00:03:15.120> playing<00:03:15.390> there

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
where when you're normally playing there

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.259 
where when you're normally playing there
would<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.590> bumpy<00:03:17.370> bit<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.730> ground<00:03:17.970> to

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
would be like a bumpy bit of ground to

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.550 
would be like a bumpy bit of ground to
make<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> harder<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.260> steer

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
make like it harder for you to steer

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.640 
make like it harder for you to steer
around<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.100> stuff<00:03:20.630> but<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.989> know<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.470> game

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
around and stuff but you know the game

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.880 
around and stuff but you know the game
can't<00:03:23.010> do<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.310> properly<00:03:23.609> like<00:03:24.540> again<00:03:25.470> it's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
can't do that properly like again it's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.069 
can't do that properly like again it's
not<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.100> problem<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.459> my<00:03:26.549> computer<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:27.690> is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
not a problem with my computer this is

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.750 
not a problem with my computer this is
always<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.799> this<00:03:28.970> trust<00:03:29.970> me<00:03:30.620> as<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.519> see

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
always like this trust me as you can see

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.830 
always like this trust me as you can see
I've<00:03:32.970> been<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.390> through<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> little

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
I've been going through the little

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.110 
I've been going through the little
checkpoints<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.739> get<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.190> red<00:03:35.670> light<00:03:35.880> turns

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
checkpoints and I get a red light turns

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.310 
checkpoints and I get a red light turns
green<00:03:36.329> every<00:03:36.780> time<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.109> through<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
green every time you go through a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.220 
green every time you go through a
checkpoint<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> we're<00:03:39.840> not<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.140> go

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
checkpoint so we're not going to go

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.449 
checkpoint so we're not going to go
through<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.470> checkpoint<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.340> go

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
through a checkpoint because you can go

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.220 
through a checkpoint because you can go
through<00:03:41.640> than<00:03:41.820> any<00:03:41.940> order<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.690> I'll<00:03:42.780> skip<00:03:42.900> one

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
through than any order so I'll skip one

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.300 
through than any order so I'll skip one
go<00:03:43.410> through<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.680> next<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.010> i'll<00:03:44.070> come<00:03:44.220> back

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
go through the next and i'll come back

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.160 
go through the next and i'll come back
to<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.579> one<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.430> we're<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.670> driving<00:03:47.970> along

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
to this one so we're just driving along

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.420 
to this one so we're just driving along
um<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.260> can't<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.010> anything<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.340> say

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
um I can't think of anything to say

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.370 
um I can't think of anything to say
before<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:51.720> drive<00:03:51.900> through<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.170> one

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
before that so we drive through this one

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.630 
before that so we drive through this one
and<00:03:52.470> get<00:03:52.560> ready<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.769> turn<00:03:52.920> around<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.489> wait

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
and get ready to turn around but wait

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.140 
and get ready to turn around but wait
what<00:03:53.970> two<00:03:54.930> lights<00:03:55.109> went<00:03:55.320> up<00:03:55.730> why<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.790> hell<00:03:57.000> did

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
what two lights went up why the hell did

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
what two lights went up why the hell did
two<00:03:57.239> lights<00:03:57.420> go<00:03:57.569> up<00:03:57.769> maybe<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.859> one's<00:03:59.010> broken

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
two lights go up maybe that one's broken

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.349 
two lights go up maybe that one's broken
we<00:03:59.430> will<00:03:59.760> try<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.940> get<00:04:00.120> here<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.980> skip<00:04:02.280> one<00:04:02.489> will

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
we will try to get here so skip one will

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.180 
we will try to get here so skip one will
drive<00:04:04.579> driving<00:04:05.579> driving<00:04:05.850> driving

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
drive driving driving driving

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.180 
drive driving driving driving
now<00:04:08.190> get<00:04:08.430> ready<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.700> back<00:04:08.879> up<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
now get ready to back up but what the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.130 
now get ready to back up but what the
hell<00:04:11.340> two<00:04:11.550> lights<00:04:11.730> going<00:04:11.940> again<00:04:12.239> another

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
hell two lights going again another

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.660 
hell two lights going again another
thing<00:04:13.349> I'll<00:04:13.470> tell<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.769> before<00:04:14.340> we<00:04:14.430> start

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
thing I'll tell you before we start

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.670 
thing I'll tell you before we start
before<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:15.569> go<00:04:15.660> on<00:04:15.840> even<00:04:16.440> though<00:04:16.530> that's

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
before we go on even though that's

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.199 
before we go on even though that's
really<00:04:16.889> stupid<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.340> two<00:04:17.489> lights<00:04:17.699> go<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:17.880> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
really stupid the two lights go on I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.879 
really stupid the two lights go on I
don't<00:04:18.419> know<00:04:18.510> why<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.500> apparently<00:04:19.650> if

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
don't know why that is so apparently if

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.650 
don't know why that is so apparently if
you<00:04:19.949> miss<00:04:20.220> one<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.090> get<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> next<00:04:21.600> one

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
you miss one and you get the next one

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.260 
you miss one and you get the next one
it'll<00:04:22.169> captures<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.590> getting<00:04:22.830> too<00:04:23.270> we're

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
it'll captures you getting too we're

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.610 
it'll captures you getting too we're
gonna<00:04:24.360> test<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.960> see<00:04:25.110> if<00:04:25.139> it'll<00:04:25.320> work<00:04:25.410> for

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
gonna test to see if it'll work for

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.950 
gonna test to see if it'll work for
three<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.919> second<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.120> see<00:04:27.300> if<00:04:27.600> you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
three in a second as you can see if you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.620 
three in a second as you can see if you
hold<00:04:28.260> forward<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:30.030> drive<00:04:30.300> forward

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
hold forward and you drive forward

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.900 
hold forward and you drive forward
you'll<00:04:30.870> always<00:04:31.260> gain<00:04:32.010> speed<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.639> will<00:04:32.729> never

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
you'll always gain speed it will never

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.280 
you'll always gain speed it will never
stop<00:04:33.210> you'll<00:04:33.419> just<00:04:33.479> gain<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.810> at<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.080> slower

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
stop you'll just gain it at a slower

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.740 
stop you'll just gain it at a slower
ratio<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.790> we're<00:04:35.880> gonna<00:04:35.970> skip<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.389> drive

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
ratio so we're gonna skip this drive

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.590 
ratio so we're gonna skip this drive
past<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.110> down<00:04:37.699> helicopter<00:04:38.699> which<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.240> smaller

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
past it down helicopter which is smaller

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.879 
past it down helicopter which is smaller
than<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.169> bigger<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:41.210> guess<00:04:42.210> maybe<00:04:42.780> not<00:04:43.680> sure

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
than the bigger I guess maybe not sure

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.890 
than the bigger I guess maybe not sure
these<00:04:44.250> big<00:04:44.430> rigs<00:04:44.639> didn't<00:04:44.880> seem<00:04:45.060> very<00:04:45.090> big<00:04:45.630> but

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
these big rigs didn't seem very big but

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.469 
these big rigs didn't seem very big but
actually<00:04:46.200> they<00:04:46.290> are<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:46.919> bigger<00:04:47.190> it's<00:04:47.550> as

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
actually they are it's bigger it's as

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.800 
actually they are it's bigger it's as
big<00:04:48.630> as<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:48.930> house<00:04:49.430> almost<00:04:50.510> what<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.630> hell

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
big as this house almost what the hell

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.010 
big as this house almost what the hell
these<00:04:52.470> are<00:04:52.650> huge<00:04:53.010> rigs<00:04:53.600> okay<00:04:54.600> so<00:04:54.660> we<00:04:54.840> skipped

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
these are huge rigs okay so we skipped

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.620 
these are huge rigs okay so we skipped
two<00:04:55.220> we're<00:04:56.220> gonna<00:04:56.310> see<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.760> sort<00:04:56.970> oh<00:04:57.120> look

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
two we're gonna see if the sort oh look

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.170 
two we're gonna see if the sort oh look
a<00:04:57.810> wall<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.590> has<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.039> be<00:04:59.100> in<00:04:59.580> there<00:04:59.639> right<00:04:59.940> now

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
a wall that has to be in there right now

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.390 
a wall that has to be in there right now
no<00:05:00.600> it<00:05:00.720> doesn't<00:05:01.050> anything<00:05:01.530> isn't<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.130> ground

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
no it doesn't anything isn't the ground

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.909 
no it doesn't anything isn't the ground
doesn't<00:05:02.639> actually<00:05:02.880> exist<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.539> game<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.860> we

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
doesn't actually exist in the game so we

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.279 
doesn't actually exist in the game so we
go<00:05:05.010> through<00:05:05.160> here<00:05:05.370> okay<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:06.840> as<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.110> see

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
go through here okay so as you can see

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.200 
go through here okay so as you can see
it<00:05:07.560> only<00:05:07.740> works<00:05:07.979> for<00:05:08.070> 2<00:05:08.310> i'm<00:05:08.639> not<00:05:08.789> sure<00:05:08.940> why<00:05:09.150> it

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
it only works for 2 i'm not sure why it

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.120 
it only works for 2 i'm not sure why it
only<00:05:09.360> works<00:05:09.600> for<00:05:09.690> two<00:05:09.900> now<00:05:10.560> i<00:05:10.590> have<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.830> go<00:05:10.950> back

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
only works for two now i have to go back

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.029 
only works for two now i have to go back
and<00:05:11.340> i<00:05:12.300> have<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:12.660> get<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.380> third<00:05:14.340> one<00:05:14.370> again<00:05:14.840> or

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
and i have to get the third one again or

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.710 
and i have to get the third one again or
since<00:05:17.039> we<00:05:17.220> know<00:05:17.340> how<00:05:17.520> this<00:05:17.669> works<00:05:17.880> now<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.210> can

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
since we know how this works now I can

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.450 
since we know how this works now I can
just<00:05:18.840> drive<00:05:19.020> through<00:05:19.260> this<00:05:19.560> one<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.039> it'll

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
just drive through this one and it'll

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.920 
just drive through this one and it'll
give<00:05:20.639> me<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.389> one<00:05:21.510> before<00:05:21.690> it

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
give me that in the one before it

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.140 
give me that in the one before it
because<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.919> game<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.190> broken<00:05:23.400> hey<00:05:23.940> let's

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
because the game is broken hey let's

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.909 
because the game is broken hey let's
drive<00:05:24.389> up<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.690> down<00:05:24.780> clips<00:05:25.260> for<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.560> little<00:05:25.680> bit

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
drive up and down clips for a little bit

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.100 
drive up and down clips for a little bit
we<00:05:26.789> know<00:05:27.570> what<00:05:27.630> you're<00:05:27.780> probably<00:05:27.930> thinking

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
we know what you're probably thinking

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.440
