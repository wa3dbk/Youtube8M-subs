00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 The big tree in the head of the big tree is the easy build fighter zudora this time 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.740
 Tournament of 2 Winning Gundam Totta Wars to appear in Come 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 And I bought a plastic model of atst that also appears in Star Wars 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.020
 Then it is a left-handed Thai fighter who wants to open each one immediately 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.020
 Most used in the Imperial Army 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.460
 It is from Doshiro from It is a fighter front 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.450
 I remember the sex Gundam ball, but the pilot in the cockpit has also been reproduced 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.020
 It looks like 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.790
 The display stand is an image of the surface of Death Star . 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.830
 It is and the mass middle file 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.010
 It is a part of the six flower pots on the side It is a part of a skeleton of a hexagon It is a part like a ball in the middle 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.180
 Hereabouts beam and 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.140
 You can reproduce the moment when the team is sold with the manual, which is a display stand . 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.589
 It is the point to put a parting seal , there are many spring places inside the cockpit 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.030
 I will 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:57.289
 It will be quite fine work Come on atst of this is a small of imperial army 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 Walker I am a walking weapon, but the reverse joint is cv I'm from the front and from the back 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.780
 Again this also seems in the cockpit has been reproduced 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.589
 It seems that a little junior high school will follow, so I will open it often in Asia 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 It is stupid 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.040
 It is a base for empty Geneva made display 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.630
 Basically it is parts foot and body part, which is also somewhere in the body part 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 It is not a foot and a body, but it is a west manual. The Lord is riding him. 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 It's tough, but it's a sticker scene, but it's hardly there 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 It looks pretty easy to go, but the Star Wing of Gundam Build Fighters Try 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.710
 It seems to be really deformed in Gundam 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.820
 It is amazing 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.900
 So it is back in the opening want od stable person foot 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.190
 And it's a part of the beam, it's a star's purse without the torso and the sound being eaten 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.479
 Different eyes look like sd The white behind is the head part 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.290
 If you put in the manual , there have been some sb deformable gunpla 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.730
 I'd like 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.870
 Ieyama bit and guard beat with me 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.290
 It looks like it's going to be a core booster, and with those parts it's a lot more real 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.490
 Ne 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.970
 It looks like it will be completed when you talk sd or real 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.990
 It's annoying 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:05.460
