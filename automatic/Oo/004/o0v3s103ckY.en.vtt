00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone i'm vladimir tishinsky and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.210
 this channel happen to eat it and today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.790
 I have on unpacking htc desire 600 this 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.910
 dvuhsimochny machine 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.670
 quad-core processor enough 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 cool screen and generally i think that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 the device was very interesting so 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.210
 what let's unpack it let's see what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:36.960
 inside and look at the device itself 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 let's go thank you store nymph 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.399
 as well as tehnomir companies for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.960
 provided by the device in the external 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.559
 the form itself is a box 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 voluminous but by today's standards here 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 although it is thin enough but if 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 of course comparing with this giant from 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.629
 nokia e50 then in my yes box is very 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 even miniature let's look at 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:11.280
 the interior of the dark apparatus itself 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.650
 and pretty but about him we are a bit later 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 on picking picking goes and 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.680
 lesbi cord is such a black adapter 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 too little black 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 headphones are also black they are yes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 red elements 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 what does this headset adjust 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.390
 the volume on the headset and no more 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.350
 Here are additional additions. 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.729
 call it all we clean here with us 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 still paperwork 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.299
 and so but all this I push aside for that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 to look as closely as possible 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.200
 on htc desire 600 he is in such 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.180
 that's pretty cool upakovochke 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.909
 films do not go here from above as usual 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.609
 on smartphones only this one 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:23.030
 Cheholchik can be so called apparatus 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.159
 looks very strong and pretty though 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.379
 the difference from the white version is that white 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.980
 version goes glossy black goes 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.069
 matt okay everything in order screen 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.920
 here is four and a half inches but run 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.790
 in advance the resolution is 960 by 540 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.680
 also there is a front camera 1 and 6 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.189
 megapixels 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.409
 on top is the speakers here for sound 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.819
 but basically speaking speaker 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.560
 he probably too 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.480
 and this and is used or can 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.269
 additional built but i to 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 Sorry, I donâ€™t know exactly but below 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.810
 logo almost si two buttons touch 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.849
 not 3 as usual android below again 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.260
 This speaker is for stereo sound 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.409
 from so here and here below the microphone 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.609
 connector for charging and micro 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.989
 yusb beats audio 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:26.290
 logo htc camera main run too 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.510
 8 megapixels ahead 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.540
 Here is such an interesting camera 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.510
 although it would be possible and ultrapixel on already 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.260
 it's just as if very fashionable though not 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.889
 I know how htc excess policy is peculiar 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.909
 and led flash but basically looks 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:50.590
 quite stylish so cute 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.590
 let me try to open it 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.000
 it is not difficult to open well the lid 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.930
 plastic is a bit like a cap in 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.510
 samsungs for sim cards and one for sim 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.739
 cards and 2 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.519
 what does this sim card support 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.540
 supports cdma standard that is possible 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.870
 sit may card insert and micro 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.810
 sd card slot connector 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.940
 32 gigabytes are such here 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.560
 moments also by the way two more types 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.350
 batteries here battery is 1860 milliampere 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.210
 an hour therefore 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.760
 the smartphone will probably not work 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.700
 very long and that is for the present 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.510
 standards it is not very much and that is 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.730
 weak for this device 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.889
 generally the first impression about the device 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.130
 positive 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.360
 the device is well in hand 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.880
 four diagonal display principle 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.830
 half an inch is just such 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.050
 more or less medieval normal and 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.010
 In general, the design itself is what it is after all 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 matt it may well not create 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.450
 such pleasant tactile sensations 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.360
 because the matt here is 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.710
 rude here but it is more 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 practical unlike glossy 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.030
 which may have slipped a further 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.460
 before i forgot to add 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.639
 that's what volume controls are here 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.250
 on the right side and above the button 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.760
 turn on off the only nuance 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.640
 the fact that here but here you see them yes but 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.280
 like this they are just not noticeable they are so 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.510
 very little felt that is 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.470
 they drowned or no eyebrow 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.310
 choose yes here they can create 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.990
 drowned so sometimes it comes at 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.060
 press and well or wrong up or 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.950
 down that is how you press that with no 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.760
 you know for sure or after all 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.590
 do you want to press 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.560
 maybe it's when it's a matter of habit 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.400
 it will then be correct but sometimes just 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.680
 miss you 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.510
 looking for where these buttons that is well 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.389
 maybe this is the first time and what 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.460
 The top button is also in the review itself 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.639
 let's see how this device 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.820
 justifies his money because he 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.400
 is probably after and honors sevan 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.190
 the most expensive dvuhsimochny smartphone 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.620
 eat well, almost Sevan is a flagship 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:31.780
 comes as if already the next class 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.860
 then of course this unit is probably the most 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:39.520
 dear first most dear 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:42.100
 here is a two-digit smartphone and plus 1 is the most 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.590
 powerful dvuhsimochny smartphone thanks 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.300
 the fact that here is a quad core 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.090
 that is, just a wolf after no turn 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.020
 certain came time came htc one 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.870
 dual sim 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.690
 that is why no matter how he is 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.180
 only and just 1 up in the review we 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.490
 all this let's take a look at why not 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.960
