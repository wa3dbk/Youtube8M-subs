 Install our self-adhesive bonding band is very easy and fast 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.120
 First, we will measure the artificial grass joint and cut the joint band 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 Next, we will open the joints of the artificial grass and we will place the union band 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.740
 Finally, we will remove the protective film from our union band and we will hook the artificial grass 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.020
 Remember that it is important to brush the fiber of our artificial grass at the end of the installation 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.300
 In this way, artificial grass joints will not be noticeable
