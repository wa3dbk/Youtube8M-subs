00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.080
 how are you doing, I am Carlos, family, we start 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.000
 a new carlo cooks in this special 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.709
 of mother's day I have here in my 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 hands this book that I really want to 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.259
 it's called southern hands 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.969
 remember that southern hands are in their 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.769
 fourth edition so it can be a good 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.379
 gift for Mother's Day who today 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 day we celebrate that we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 make a catch and we will move to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 puerto varas the recipe that I took my 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 hand today does not belong to me but between 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.900
 joaquin to lane how to make a cushion 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.900
 fast see it here in Carlos 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.620
 it is always good to have a good machine 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.680
 to beat and what are we going to put on 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 make butter 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.720
 next to sugar and we will work for 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 a technique called working at 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.280
 ointment and this is precisely how 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.160
 says the word until the texture is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.590
 like a soft creame we start very 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.590
 slowly and then we raise the speed 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.530
 I will look for flour without dust that is the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 What I need for this recipe is a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.940
 a little less than two cups what we're going 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.680
 to occupy 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 and what is important is that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 make a gene so that we stay a little 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 more fluffy the flour has to be sifted 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.509
 let's add 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.659
 one and a half teaspoon of powder 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 to bake 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.060
 it has already the comma point 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.870
 when this as a creampie has that 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.150
 cream texture 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 in the minute then add the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.870
 sifted flour 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.010
 I'm going back now but not so strong 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.560
 and now he added the vanilla 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.130
 when everything is incorporated everything 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 you have to do is take out the mixture and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.150
 pass it and this fundamental about a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.810
 Ring mold that is removable from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.180
 easy way there we take everything 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.319
 and now with our dough roll what 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.909
 dipped slightly there 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.680
 Damaso from above we are looking for 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.099
 they can do the same thing constantly 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.099
 the spoon 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 favorites and what we wanted to do today 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.450
 day in this tribute to mothers in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.060
 occupy a fruit that distinguishes us as 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 100% Chilean fruit that are the fines 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.590
 they are multiple as they are also named 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 in blue of our country I put a little bit of 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 impalpable sugar and heat an oven like 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.340
 I told them not so strong until the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.340
 mass is completely 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.850
 let's fall out of the oven 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.590
 obviously in the fruit you put a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.990
 little bit darker because it cooks well 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.970
 I recommend them is to let them go 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.440
 while it's hot it's going to be 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.440
 much easier to remove them 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.660
 if you look at a quick cushion that is not 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.459
 very high but what has happened is that the 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.830
 Fruit has been embedded within the dough 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.420
 which gives it a very special flavor very 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.040
 characteristic and very rich because it is 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.160
 mojadito as it has to be a good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.160
 I touched 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 an easy recipe to make that you can 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.640
 do with any fruit you saw it here in 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.640
