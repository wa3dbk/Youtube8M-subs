how<00:02:39.319> nill<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.349> compared<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.129> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
how nill it is and this is compared to a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.259

small diapers I'll just probably do

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.720 
small diapers I'll just probably do
safety<00:03:01.840> pins<00:03:02.050> like<00:03:02.290> except<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.160> baby<00:03:03.310> saves

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.210 
safety pins like except the baby saves
safety<00:03:04.030> pins<00:03:04.210> not<00:03:04.390> these<00:03:04.570> guide<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.860> will

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
safety pins not these guide so I will

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.190 
safety pins not these guide so I will
show<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.490> step-by-step<00:03:06.820> exactly<00:03:07.570> how<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.930> made

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
show you step-by-step exactly how I made

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.190 
show you step-by-step exactly how I made
this<00:03:08.350> beautiful<00:03:08.560> diaper<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
this beautiful diaper so this is the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.380 
this beautiful diaper so this is the
inside<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.640> insert<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.120> I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
inside and this is the insert that I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.980 
inside and this is the insert that I
made<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.520> newborn<00:03:15.910> small<00:03:16.330> diapers<00:03:16.720> but<00:03:16.959> I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
made for the newborn small diapers but I

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.420 
made for the newborn small diapers but I
didn't<00:03:17.290> realize<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.620> they<00:03:17.950> were<00:03:18.010> gonna<00:03:18.190> be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
didn't realize that they were gonna be

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.060 
didn't realize that they were gonna be
so<00:03:18.640> big<00:03:19.030> compared<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.750> diaper<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.860> what<00:03:21.040> I

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
so big compared to the diaper so what I

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.490 
so big compared to the diaper so what I
did<00:03:21.220> was<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.730> folded<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.570> front<00:03:22.840> down<00:03:23.080> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
did was I just folded the front down and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.720 
did was I just folded the front down and
folded<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.610> like<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.740> for<00:03:27.190> small

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
folded it like that so this is for small

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.080 
folded it like that so this is for small
babies<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.830> if<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.100> can<00:03:30.310> tell<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.800> casein<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
babies so if you can tell the casein the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.140 
babies so if you can tell the casein the
elastic<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.840> encased<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:36.040> how<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.670> did<00:03:36.970> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
elastic is encased and how I did that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.750 
elastic is encased and how I did that
was<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.450> left<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:38.170> part<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.950> front<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.489> the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760
