at s SPT we have four different types of
Olympic<00:00:14.480> weightlifting<00:00:15.289> bars<00:00:15.559> I'm<00:00:15.859> going<00:00:15.980> to

Olympic weightlifting bars I'm going to
discuss<00:00:16.400> right<00:00:16.759> now<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:17.419> differences

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
discuss right now the differences

Olympic weightlifting bars of slightly

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.360 
Olympic weightlifting bars of slightly
different<00:00:56.180> let's<00:00:56.660> treat<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:56.989> differently<00:00:57.370> the

bars flex a little bit Whittier and they

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.700 
bars flex a little bit Whittier and they
spin<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> little<00:01:02.600> bit<00:01:02.750> faster<00:01:03.320> which<00:01:03.440> I'm<00:01:03.590> going

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
spin a little bit faster which I'm going

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.499 
spin a little bit faster which I'm going
to<00:01:03.770> show<00:01:03.950> you<00:01:03.980> close-ups<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:04.969> in<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
to show you close-ups of that in the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.609 
to show you close-ups of that in the
second<00:01:05.869> portion<00:01:06.049> of<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:07.009> video<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:09.290> want

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
second portion of this video you want

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.020 
second portion of this video you want
with<00:01:09.950> Olympic<00:01:10.310> weightlifting<00:01:10.759> bars

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
with Olympic weightlifting bars

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.609 
with Olympic weightlifting bars
throughout<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.600> bars<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:12.020> oscillate<00:01:12.500> you

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
throughout the bars to oscillate you

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.190 
throughout the bars to oscillate you
want<00:01:12.890> them<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.159> spin<00:01:13.430> faster<00:01:14.030> my<00:01:14.509> nature<00:01:14.780> in

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
want them to spin faster my nature in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.429 
want them to spin faster my nature in
the<00:01:15.439> overhead<00:01:15.740> lifts<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.700> need<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.600> bar<00:01:17.840> to

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
the overhead lifts you need the bar to

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.770 
the overhead lifts you need the bar to
spin<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.189> rotate<00:01:19.579> with<00:01:19.819> Markham's<00:01:20.329> overhead

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
spin to rotate with Markham's overhead

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.690 
spin to rotate with Markham's overhead
and<00:01:21.049> that's<00:01:21.499> why<00:01:21.679> you<00:01:21.740> want<00:01:22.039> faster<00:01:22.459> more

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and that's why you want faster more

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.149 
and that's why you want faster more
power<00:01:23.270> bars<00:01:23.569> now<00:01:23.780> can<00:01:23.959> afford<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:24.469> you

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
power bars now can afford you that you

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.179 
power bars now can afford you that you
also<00:01:25.990> notice<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.259> was<00:01:27.409> most<00:01:27.679> olympic

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
also notice that it was most olympic

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.849 
also notice that it was most olympic
