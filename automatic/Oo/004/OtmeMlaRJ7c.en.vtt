00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
pistol and its mags can be converted to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
pistol and its mags can be converted to
suit<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> revolver<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
suit the revolver when you do this it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
suit the revolver when you do this it
actually<00:00:41.460> removes<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.300> extra<00:00:42.690> bullet<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
actually removes the extra bullet that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
actually removes the extra bullet that
you<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> other<00:00:46.200> gun

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you would have in the in the other gun

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
you would have in the in the other gun
so<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> convert<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:47.539> it'll<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.690> only

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so if you convert it back it'll now only

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
so if you convert it back it'll now only
have<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:50.670> lost

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
have as you can see that it's now lost

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
have as you can see that it's now lost
one<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> its<00:00:51.510> bullets<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.500> keep<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.860> mind

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
one of its bullets so keep that in mind

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.830 
one of its bullets so keep that in mind
when<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.430> swapping<00:00:53.699> ammunition<00:00:54.329> types<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
when you're swapping ammunition types it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
when you're swapping ammunition types it
will<00:00:55.140> drop<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> yeah<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
will drop it off so yeah so that's a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
will drop it off so yeah so that's a
diamond<00:00:58.350> issue<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.680> only<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:59.010> six<00:00:59.280> shots

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
diamond issue and you only get six shots

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
diamond issue and you only get six shots
so<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.090> probably<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> lowest<00:01:01.500> i

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so it's probably one of the lowest i

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
so it's probably one of the lowest i
think<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> lowest<00:01:03.420> ammo<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.470> shots

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
think it is the lowest ammo like shots

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
think it is the lowest ammo like shots
you<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.780> advantage<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.350> weapon<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you get the advantage of this weapon is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
you get the advantage of this weapon is
it<00:01:08.010> deals<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.909> highest<00:01:09.360> amount<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> damage<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it deals the highest amount of damage of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
it deals the highest amount of damage of
all<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> side<00:01:10.890> arms<00:01:11.280> every<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:11.790> side<00:01:12.060> arm

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
all the side arms every other side arm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.429 
all the side arms every other side arm
deals<00:01:12.659> around<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.610> 889<00:01:14.610> blood<00:01:15.030> whereas<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
deals around about 889 blood whereas the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.070 
deals around about 889 blood whereas the
revolver<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.810> m1911<00:01:18.810> both<00:01:19.380> deal<00:01:21.080> 1389

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
revolver and the m1911 both deal 1389

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.370 
revolver and the m1911 both deal 1389
damage<00:01:22.950> opponent<00:01:23.520> shot<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.479> still<00:01:24.689> even<00:01:24.960> if

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
damage opponent shot but still even if

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
damage opponent shot but still even if
you<00:01:25.650> want<00:01:25.950> shoot<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.970> shoot<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> zombie

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you want shoot by if you shoot a zombie

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
you want shoot by if you shoot a zombie
once<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> chest<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.070> going

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
once in the chest it's still not going

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.800 
once in the chest it's still not going
to<00:01:29.310> kill<00:01:29.520> them<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.780> least

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to kill them you need to get at least

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
to kill them you need to get at least
three<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> four<00:01:31.350> shots<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
three to four shots take them out so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
three to four shots take them out so
given<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> fact<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.020> six<00:01:34.320> shots<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
given the fact in you have six shots you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
given the fact in you have six shots you
want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.430> accurate<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.909> this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
want to be really accurate with this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.620 
want to be really accurate with this
weapon<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:37.259> where<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> revolver<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:39.390> kind

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
weapon that's where the revolver it kind

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
weapon that's where the revolver it kind
of<00:01:39.659> makes<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> has<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.619> pretty<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.430> has

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of makes it up it has a pretty it has

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
of makes it up it has a pretty it has
probably<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.939> longest<00:01:42.180> range<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
probably the longest range of all the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.889 
probably the longest range of all the
weapons<00:01:43.729> world<00:01:44.729> sidearms<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.450> that's<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
weapons world sidearms so that's one of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
weapons world sidearms so that's one of
its<00:01:49.079> advantages<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> actually<00:01:50.189> choosing<00:01:50.520> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
its advantages of actually choosing this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480 
its advantages of actually choosing this
weapon<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.020> quite<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
weapon so it's not quite that much of a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.690 
weapon so it's not quite that much of a
disadvantage<00:01:54.229> another<00:01:55.229> downside<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:56.159> it's

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
disadvantage another downside is it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.530 
disadvantage another downside is it's
relatively<00:01:57.540> slow<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.380> shooting<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
relatively slow at shooting and it is a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
relatively slow at shooting and it is a
high<00:02:01.250> recoil<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.610> well<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:04.280> its<00:02:05.280> noise<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
high recoil as well as its noise is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
high recoil as well as its noise is
pretty<00:02:06.030> high<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.780> might<00:02:06.960> attract

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
pretty high as well so you might attract

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.100 
pretty high as well so you might attract
a<00:02:07.560> bit<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.829> zombie<00:02:08.129> attention

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
a bit of zombie attention

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.990 
a bit of zombie attention
the<00:02:09.259> other<00:02:09.380> ones<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:10.340> only<00:02:10.550> get<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> head<00:02:10.970> shot

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
the other ones so I only get a head shot

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.560 
the other ones so I only get a head shot
on<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.480> Baba<00:02:11.810> here<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:14.060> bouncing<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.510> and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
on this Baba here it's bouncing up and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.950 
on this Baba here it's bouncing up and
down<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:15.170> haven't<00:02:15.830> night<00:02:16.570> because<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:17.720> safer

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
down I haven't night because it's safer

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.050 
down I haven't night because it's safer
to<00:02:18.140> do<00:02:18.380> these<00:02:18.560> things<00:02:18.770> at<00:02:18.890> night<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.340> probably<00:02:19.940> I

to do these things at night I probably I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.330

three to four shots to take out a zombie

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.120 
three to four shots to take out a zombie
if<00:02:48.620> you're<00:02:48.770> just<00:02:48.890> shooting<00:02:49.100> them<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.550> back

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
if you're just shooting them in the back

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.910 
if you're just shooting them in the back
that's<00:02:52.130> all<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.600> weapon<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.020> really<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.590> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
that's all this weapon can really do it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.080 
that's all this weapon can really do it
is<00:02:55.300> relatively<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.580> an<00:02:58.760> acquired

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
is relatively it's it's an acquired

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.750 
is relatively it's it's an acquired
taste<00:02:59.209> really<00:02:59.780> like<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.340> want<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.610> have

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
taste really like if you want to have

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.400 
taste really like if you want to have
more<00:03:02.030> shots<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.020> don't<00:03:03.110> feel

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
more shots like if you don't feel

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.449 
more shots like if you don't feel
confident<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.190> being<00:03:04.520> able<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.910> headshots

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
confident in being able to get headshots

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.280 
confident in being able to get headshots
then<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:07.640> weapon<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.720> know<00:03:08.840> isn't<00:03:09.110> really

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
then this weapon you know isn't really

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.330 
then this weapon you know isn't really
for<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.530> you're<00:03:10.070> more<00:03:10.190> likely<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.270> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
for you you're more likely to go for the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.210 
for you you're more likely to go for the
the<00:03:13.340> m9<00:03:14.080> 1911<00:03:15.080> because<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.350> have<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.799> extra

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the m9 1911 because you have that extra

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.759 
the m9 1911 because you have that extra
shot<00:03:16.580> you're<00:03:17.180> better<00:03:17.330> off<00:03:17.420> going<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> m9

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
shot you're better off going for the m9

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.140 
shot you're better off going for the m9
or<00:03:19.010> any<00:03:19.160> other<00:03:19.370> weapon<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.760> has<00:03:19.910> more

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
or any other weapon that has more

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.509 
or any other weapon that has more
bullets<00:03:20.600> per<00:03:20.780> cabin<00:03:21.019> caliber<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.040> still<00:03:22.280> think

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
bullets per cabin caliber I still think

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.970 
bullets per cabin caliber I still think
the<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.930> weapons<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:24.500> good<00:03:24.709> especially

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the this weapons pretty good especially

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.590 
the this weapons pretty good especially
starting<00:03:25.610> off<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:25.910> definitely<00:03:26.330> better<00:03:26.510> than

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
starting off it's definitely better than

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.050 
starting off it's definitely better than
a<00:03:26.780> Makarov<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:27.560> when<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.340> comes<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.730> going<00:03:28.850> up

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
a Makarov but when it comes to going up

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.600 
a Makarov but when it comes to going up
above<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.140> want<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.610> determined

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
above that you want to be determined

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.280 
above that you want to be determined
what<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.790> want<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.090> another<00:03:32.720> advantage<00:03:33.170> is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
what you want to do another advantage is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.930 
what you want to do another advantage is
because<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.739> deals<00:03:33.860> more<00:03:34.280> damage<00:03:34.340> than<00:03:34.820> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
because it deals more damage than the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.860 
because it deals more damage than the
other<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:36.200> weapons<00:03:36.950> per<00:03:37.220> bullet<00:03:37.880> when

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
other one of a weapons per bullet when

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.960 
other one of a weapons per bullet when
it<00:03:38.900> comes<00:03:39.140> up<00:03:39.290> against<00:03:39.769> other<00:03:39.980> players<00:03:40.190> this

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
it comes up against other players this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.759 
it comes up against other players this
actually<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.750> little<00:03:42.170> bit<00:03:42.290> better<00:03:42.440> and

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
actually is a little bit better and

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.120 
actually is a little bit better and
given<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.430> has<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> better<00:03:44.209> range<00:03:44.570> and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
given that it has a better range and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.410 
given that it has a better range and
it's<00:03:46.130> iron<00:03:46.370> sights<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.910> little<00:03:46.940> bit<00:03:47.269> better

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
it's iron sights a little bit better

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.860 
it's iron sights a little bit better
than<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> other<00:03:47.930> pistols<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.760> when<00:03:50.750> you're

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
than the other pistols so when you're

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.060 
than the other pistols so when you're
going<00:03:50.959> up<00:03:51.080> against<00:03:51.320> players<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.799> can<00:03:51.950> be

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
going up against players this can be

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.070 
going up against players this can be
pretty<00:03:52.250> good<00:03:52.489> but<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:52.940> will<00:03:53.150> take<00:03:53.420> probably

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
pretty good but it will take probably

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.900 
pretty good but it will take probably
more<00:03:54.500> than<00:03:54.650> six<00:03:54.950> shots<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.400> take<00:03:55.580> them<00:03:55.760> out

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
more than six shots to take them out

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.630 
more than six shots to take them out
though<00:03:56.630> given<00:03:57.410> its<00:03:57.530> power<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.190> have<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> high

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
though given its power you have a high

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.340 
though given its power you have a high
chance<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:59.150> actually<00:03:59.299> knock<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.870> unconscious

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
chance of actually knock you unconscious

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.350 
chance of actually knock you unconscious
if<00:04:00.799> you're<00:04:00.980> getting<00:04:01.430> some<00:04:01.730> good<00:04:01.880> shots<00:04:02.090> into

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
if you're getting some good shots into

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360 
if you're getting some good shots into
him<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.080> hope<00:04:03.320> this<00:04:03.470> has<00:04:03.590> been<00:04:03.620> helpful<00:04:03.739> hope
