we<00:04:46.870> have<00:04:47.080> spent<00:04:47.350> five<00:04:47.740> years<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.550> build<00:04:48.790> a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
we have spent five years to build a

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.200 
we have spent five years to build a
bicycle<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.720> will<00:04:49.960> be<00:04:50.110> your<00:04:50.500> most<00:04:50.860> reliable

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

adventure<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.240> basically<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:56.260> invented<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
adventure so basically we invented the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.520 
adventure so basically we invented the
inner<00:04:57.340> drive<00:04:57.760> system<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.900> make<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.110> useful

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
inner drive system and to make it useful

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:52.370
