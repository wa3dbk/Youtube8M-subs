00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 1 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 1 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.150
 our world is running out of steam I hope all 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830
 very very good because I 'm fishing 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.230
 today we meet for Christmas 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.849
 special video so following the request 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.010
 of subscribers I wanted to create a tutorial 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.500
 to frankly improve your 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.120
 login on cabessut blackhawks 2 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.379
 as well as all of the ticker-collar workers 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.809
 leaving the market will be mostly the game 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.030
 fps for this tutorial will allow you 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.379
 to have a better ping so I 'm going I 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.540
 explain me a ping 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.000
 it's the lag time between you and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.149
 the game server plus your ping is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.800
 bigger and bigger your game will shift so the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.590
 it's better to have a pin god not 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
 high so by default your pink help and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.399
 about 250 it does not depend on your 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.899
 internet internet providers sorry 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.790
 I'm at a hundred and fifty for 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.290
 the moment I have the freebox so if you 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.229
 have lightbox it can be more or less 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.649
 so I already could not exceed the 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.550
 coming in under the senses by 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.440
 against if you do suture it 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.229
 could even go down to 50 see 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.539
 30 so that will also improve your 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.479
 connection on black ops to avoid 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.490
 latency is also ignored your 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.700
 connection bar if you are two 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 clean passed to 4 and 5 very easily 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.350
 of which there will be a part on p3 which 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.140
 will be a little fast and its configuration 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.729
 of the dns is the most important part 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.229
 for me that will be done on pc so a 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.420
 pump could start with the part 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.679
 low scale three of which once 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.410
 in the pastiche a rose to go on the 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.569
 go on the bread menu I pay a little 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.160
 installed on the network settings menu 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.679
 you will do by m connection 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 internet get them then 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.890
 customize of course and you go 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.090
 enter your username to sites 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.250
 english annick as you do like 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.110
 usually and then go on and continue and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.599
 you will manually choose other 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.099
 dns as here the fact we will use 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.569
 google claws that are the most 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.160
 prompt about results in response 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.590
 to the servers that are really very 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.180
 fast so its dns never change there 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.650
 are universal you have to walk as much 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.319
 on ps3 only on xbox 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 so it was six boxes or made too many 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.360
 settings store google dns 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.400
 like me tonight it's the same at home 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.069
 there are no worries you will put for 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.920
 the first primary forgiveness the year m 8 8 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.860
 8 8 and for the secondary it's the guys 8 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.909
 him 4 4 as I do in screen then 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.439
 if you will continue I was not going 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.140
 touch others if you end up there 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.000
 nothing at all here so I'm going 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.900
 go directly to part 2 which 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.480
 will be done on the pc adds i have so we 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.189
 find on my computer I want to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.189
 specify that these tutorials is valid 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.319
 on windows xp vista 7 and 8 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.810
 so you have not yet available for 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 mac of course so you go you go 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.359
 access to other russian publisher thanks 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.969
 to a client on start menu run 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.660
 I'm going to put republished r I had some 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:11.600
 ideas of support for Cairo 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.530
 so close to a window will open 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.110
 the registry editor 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 you go on http wizdeo.com s ur 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:27.800
 system during seven-service control and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.400
 you are going to look for ip ip between the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.840
 file tcp / ip forever 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.569
 you will see that there are several 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.420
 folders of which there is tcp ip tcp ip 6 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.720
 tcp / ip and roger selectivity on promise 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.370
 the normal of tcp ideas developed on 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.040
 parameters and you clicked on 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.269
 interface so once all and in 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.879
 our interface to go to see several 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.099
 soda also like 3d character a little 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.019
 so special from one computer to another 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.659
 it can vary to have as much as 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.900
 q10 other choice not to break the 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.599
 head I want to create a value in 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.980
 every sub folder so I'm screaming this 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.040
 first game created the new value 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.480
 32-bit dword so if you have a 64 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.599
 bits to create a board value 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.760
 you eat at 32 8 so here I create the 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:19.280
 tcp value to setca frequency that I 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.859
 would of course put in the discussion the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.010
 video one shows and a half explaining 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.650
 better and better detailing the the tutorial 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.229
 and it will not worry so a 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.410
 once created the validate in Switzerland has 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.930
 explained twice on you go 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.400
 put the homeland goal is the value 1 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.039
 here we know how to do it for everyone 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.580
 of this folder then I make them 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:46.030
 once I want to do for each chef 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.030
 This folder 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:05:02.080
 always the same a brave one it was 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.080
 quite frequent if you're very late 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.410
 so that's once you did 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.820
 all this all this you have wheels under 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.010
 developed the records you go 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.310
 go back to the beginning until the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.340
 root of your computer 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.740
 we are adorned here and you will leave 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.120
 on local machine but instead of 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.370
 click on system this time you 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.980
 go click on software I was going 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.400
 of gasoline is holding microsoft sees the clique 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:39.320
 and microsoft and you're going down 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.640
 up to msm q so loved it kills me there 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.040
 computers that have not far from 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.350
 at home on our windows I'm not 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.730
 so for those who do not have I in 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.770
 the readme file Thursday, June 2 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.380
 I'm going to put a file of 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.820
 download msm kills point rules for 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.050
 refuse the right to click twice 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.160
 on it so that it will appear 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.550
 automatically in your database 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.520
 register 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.290
 it will necessarily be necessary 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.940
 msm files folder to coach tutorial 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.160
 so I if you do not have it I you 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.120
 will give his description not to have for 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.440
 to see her 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.880

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.950
 you if you do not have there always 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.450
 a solution do not worry so 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.420
 once you get it for all that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.660
 i tell you you clicked on mcm s &amp; m 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.640
 pardon parameters and we must accuse 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.710
 time parameters of the teammate you 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.410
 do not recreate forgiveness I'm sorry 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.950
 breath there is the night and then a 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.830
 matt time

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.980
 here you go again always 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.170
 until the beginning 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.900
 here present media could close 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.860
 your registry editor you are missing 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.870
 more than restart your adsl 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.730
