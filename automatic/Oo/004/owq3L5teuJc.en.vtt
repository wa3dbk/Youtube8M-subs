00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.030
 tapping board presents 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:25.330
 and the prosthesis fixes the loss of a 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.730
 tooth generates alterations in the mouth 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.890
 that will be greater the greater the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.710
 number of lost pieces and time 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 elapsed until its replacement in 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
 absence of tooth food 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.950
 They destroy in the free gingiva during 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 intake making it difficult to chew and 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 producing irritations 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.400
 next the adjacent teeth and 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 opposites will try to occupy the space 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.700
 empty and they will be inclining little by little 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.800
 until you find the lost contact that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.690
 will make the interdental points 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.640
 open up, hindering hygiene and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.770
 facilitating food retention 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.950
 between the teeth which will increase the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.280
 occurrence of caries and the formation of 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.860
 Salt 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.510
 in addition the packaged food also 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.330
 will favor the appearance of the disease 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.280
 periodontal and eventually as the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.650
 the opposite tooth will try to find 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.619
 its opposite will be losing anchorage 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:34.780
 little by little there will be mobility and even 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:37.000
 the change of 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.280
 position of the teeth so that this is 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.560
 articulate incorrectly appearing 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.100
 undue contacts and overloads that 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.920
 they will cause wear and pain 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.869
 to avoid all this it is possible that your 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 dentist propose a treatment 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.210
 dental that includes a fixed prosthesis 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 There are several types of fixed prosthesis 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.770
 as for example the veneers 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 thin sheets generally porcelain 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.640
 that adhere to the visible surface 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.470
 of the tooth to improve its quality 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.539
 aesthetics the veneers are a solution 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.700
 for patients dissatisfied with their 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.540
 smile with them they get 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.300
 spectacular results but the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.580
 most common fixed prosthesis is the crown the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 artificial crown replaces the crown 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 of the teeth when it is 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.489
 finds in poor condition or when only the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.489
 tooth root is usable 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.740
 The crowns can be metal 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.170
 ceramic or combined or even others 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.330
 materials like zirconium crowns 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.160
 combined they provide a great hardness 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.160
 and an excellent aesthetic 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.120
 finally the bridges the bridges are 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.190
 so to speak crowns attached to each other 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.660
 and they are usually recommended when 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.660
 lost one or several teeth 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.430
 during the making of the teeth 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.770
 neighbors will be carved and used 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.480
 pillars and on them will be based on 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.370
 permanently the bridge although the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.530
 bridges can be an excellent option 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.330
 We advise you to avoid 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.580
 mutilation caused by carving 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.210
 Consult your dentist about 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.210
 dental implant 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.470
 thanks to the fixed prosthesis and its 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.209
 dentist at the end chewing and the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.209
 aesthetics will be as before 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.510
 i 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.790
