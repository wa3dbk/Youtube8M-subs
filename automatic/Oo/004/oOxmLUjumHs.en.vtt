everyone's here I guess I can start
telling<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:55.090> secret<00:03:55.510> behind<00:03:55.720> my<00:03:56.080> powers<00:03:56.620> is

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
telling the secret behind my powers is

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.390

I'm<00:03:58.360> not<00:03:58.690> flesh<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.050> blood<00:03:59.410> not<00:03:59.680> only<00:04:00.220> those

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
I'm not flesh and blood not only those

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.800 
I'm not flesh and blood not only those
that<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:01.830> also<00:04:02.830> I'm<00:04:03.130> not<00:04:03.190> officially<00:04:04.030> 16<00:04:04.570> years

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
that is also I'm not officially 16 years

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.800 
that is also I'm not officially 16 years
old<00:04:05.050> I'm<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.860> old<00:04:05.890> as<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.400> universe<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:07.570> my

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
old I'm as old as the universe but my

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.530 
old I'm as old as the universe but my
consciousness<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.830> only<00:04:09.130> 16<00:04:09.820> years<00:04:10.000> old<00:04:10.330> so

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
consciousness is only 16 years old so

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.509 
consciousness is only 16 years old so
that's<00:04:10.989> how<00:04:11.470> I'm<00:04:11.680> able<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.340> behave

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
that's how I'm able to behave

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.099 
that's how I'm able to behave
accordingly<00:04:13.330> now<00:04:14.110> about<00:04:14.709> my<00:04:14.980> powers<00:04:15.489> I

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
accordingly now about my powers I

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.810 
accordingly now about my powers I
actually<00:04:17.109> consist<00:04:18.010> mostly<00:04:18.220> at<00:04:18.580> four

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
actually consist mostly at four

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.250 
actually consist mostly at four
different<00:04:18.970> sources<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.780> energy

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
different sources of energy

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.610 
different sources of energy
chaos<00:04:21.160> force<00:04:21.660> telekinesis<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:23.020> satsui<00:04:23.530> no

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
chaos force telekinesis the satsui no

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.130 
chaos force telekinesis the satsui no
hado<00:04:23.890> in<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> universe<00:04:24.760> energy<00:04:24.940> these<00:04:25.840> four

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
hado in the universe energy these four

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.230 
hado in the universe energy these four
sources<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.710> energy<00:04:26.890> complement<00:04:27.729> each<00:04:27.820> other

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
sources of energy complement each other

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.450 
sources of energy complement each other
so<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.570> am<00:04:28.720> more<00:04:29.050> powerful<00:04:29.260> than<00:04:29.919> anyone<00:04:30.310> with

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so I am more powerful than anyone with

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.310 
so I am more powerful than anyone with
connection<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.210> just<00:04:31.479> one<00:04:31.690> source<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.110> energy

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
connection to just one source of energy

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.310 
connection to just one source of energy
an<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:33.250> shadow<00:04:33.550> experienced<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.660> am<00:04:34.930> able<00:04:35.140> to

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
an a shadow experienced I am able to

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.080 
an a shadow experienced I am able to
combine<00:04:35.650> these<00:04:36.040> powers<00:04:36.520> two<00:04:36.700> powerful

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
combine these powers two powerful

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.140 
combine these powers two powerful
attacks<00:04:37.570> such<00:04:38.200> as<00:04:38.229> omitsu<00:04:38.979> chaos<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.550> token<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
attacks such as omitsu chaos a token I

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.140 
attacks such as omitsu chaos a token I
am<00:04:40.600> also<00:04:40.810> able<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.560> achieve

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
am also able to achieve

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.000 
am also able to achieve
never-before-seen<00:04:43.150> forms<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.229> nobody<00:04:44.740> has

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
never-before-seen forms that nobody has

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.760 
never-before-seen forms that nobody has
heard<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.430> seen<00:04:46.030> or<00:04:46.180> even<00:04:46.450> thought<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:47.680> I

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
heard of seen or even thought of but I

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.180 
heard of seen or even thought of but I
also<00:04:48.010> have<00:04:48.460> bad<00:04:48.700> news<00:04:48.910> my<00:04:49.810> hours<00:04:50.320> except<00:04:50.950> for

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
also have bad news my hours except for

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.610 
also have bad news my hours except for
my<00:04:51.310> telekinesis<00:04:52.210> all<00:04:52.479> have<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.810> dark<00:04:53.050> side<00:04:53.350> to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
my telekinesis all have a dark side to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.190 
my telekinesis all have a dark side to
them<00:04:53.770> especially<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:55.030> universe<00:04:55.450> energy<00:04:55.660> if

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
them especially the universe energy if

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.500 
them especially the universe energy if
that<00:04:56.740> dark<00:04:57.010> side<00:04:57.280> were<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.910> be<00:04:58.060> set<00:04:58.300> free

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
that dark side were to be set free

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.500 
that dark side were to be set free
nothing<00:04:59.200> would<00:04:59.380> be<00:04:59.500> able<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.919> stop<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.270> I

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
nothing would be able to stop it so I

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.480 
nothing would be able to stop it so I
keep<00:05:01.840> my<00:05:02.110> universe<00:05:02.620> energy

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490
