00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.140 
future it also helps us keep on from
your<00:03:40.350> process<00:03:40.799> equipment<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.970> get<00:03:42.120> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
your process equipment because you get a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.390 
your process equipment because you get a

there's<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.750> government<00:04:04.960> for<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> first<00:04:05.740> time

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
there's a government for the first time

there's a government for the first time
usually<00:04:06.400> we<00:04:06.490> show<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.700> one<00:04:07.000> else<00:04:07.180> ram<00:04:07.480> and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
usually we show you one else ram and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.890 
usually we show you one else ram and
this<00:04:08.530> one<00:04:08.710> shows<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.130> second<00:04:09.640> one<00:04:09.690> it's<00:04:10.690> a
