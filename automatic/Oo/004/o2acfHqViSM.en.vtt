00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the wrong diagonal which would mean we

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.130 
the wrong diagonal which would mean we

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
want to be going up when the horses

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.590 
want to be going up when the horses
outside<00:01:57.040> shoulders<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.820> coming<00:01:58.240> forward<00:01:58.420> a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
outside shoulders and coming forward a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.310 
outside shoulders and coming forward a
bit<00:01:58.750> yet<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.800> how<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.640> hell<00:02:00.970> do<00:02:01.120> we<00:02:01.150> do<00:02:01.420> that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
bit yet so how the hell do we do that

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.219 
bit yet so how the hell do we do that
I<00:02:02.350> remember<00:02:03.220> when<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.430> was<00:02:03.520> learning<00:02:04.229> that's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
I remember when I was learning that's

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.130 
I remember when I was learning that's
first<00:02:06.040> learning<00:02:06.729> rising<00:02:07.270> trot<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> don't

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
first learning rising trot so I don't

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.779 
first learning rising trot so I don't
know<00:02:08.229> how<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.500> are<00:02:08.740> with<00:02:08.979> your<00:02:09.039> rising<00:02:09.580> trot

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
know how you are with your rising trot

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.910 
know how you are with your rising trot
and<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.539> really<00:02:10.810> congratulate<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.860> your

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and I really congratulate you on your

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.520 
and I really congratulate you on your
journey<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.940> even<00:02:13.540> trying<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> figure<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
journey on even trying to figure out and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.860 
journey on even trying to figure out and
learn<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.220> master<00:02:15.370> how<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.330> rising<00:02:16.690> trot

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
learn and master how to do rising trot

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.810 
learn and master how to do rising trot
because<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:17.800> not<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> skill<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.310> were<00:02:18.610> born

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
because it's not a skill that were born

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.979 
because it's not a skill that were born
with<00:02:18.910> I've<00:02:19.240> never<00:02:19.480> seen<00:02:19.720> someone

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
with I've never seen someone

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.900 
with I've never seen someone
straightaway<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.010> start<00:02:21.310> trotting<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> horse

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
straightaway I start trotting on a horse

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.720 
straightaway I start trotting on a horse
and<00:02:22.090> go<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> down<00:02:22.720> perfectly<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and go up and down perfectly but it is a

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.720 
and go up and down perfectly but it is a
skill<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.970> would<00:02:25.180> give<00:02:25.330> us<00:02:25.480> quite<00:02:26.080> quickly

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
skill that would give us quite quickly

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.210 
skill that would give us quite quickly
but<00:02:27.730> that's<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.150> first<00:02:28.330> step<00:02:28.540> probably<00:02:29.220> don't

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
but that's the first step probably don't

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.130 
but that's the first step probably don't
get<00:02:30.370> too<00:02:30.640> fast<00:02:30.910> about<00:02:31.150> diagonals<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.989> you're

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
get too fast about diagonals if you're

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.550 
get too fast about diagonals if you're
not<00:02:33.209> masterful<00:02:34.209> get<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:34.630> going<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> down

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
not masterful get at going up and down

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.530 
not masterful get at going up and down
so<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.100> was<00:02:36.280> teaching<00:02:36.430> my<00:02:36.670> husband<00:02:37.060> how<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.270> ride

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
so I was teaching my husband how to ride

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.199 
so I was teaching my husband how to ride
and<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.200> our<00:02:38.320> trip<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> Africa<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
and for our trip to Africa and for the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.960 
and for our trip to Africa and for the
first<00:02:40.420> six<00:02:40.900> weeks<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.250> up<00:02:42.580> down

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
first six weeks I was just like up down

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.440 
first six weeks I was just like up down
up<00:02:43.239> down

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
up down

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.970 
up down
I<00:02:43.570> don't<00:02:43.840> care<00:02:43.989> what<00:02:44.110> techno<00:02:44.470> you're<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.739> I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
I don't care what techno you're on I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.380 
I don't care what techno you're on I
don't<00:02:45.400> care<00:02:45.550> what<00:02:45.730> you're<00:02:45.880> doing<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.330> don't

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
don't care what you're doing I don't

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.970 
don't care what you're doing I don't
care<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:46.780> your<00:02:46.870> shoulders<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.770> can't

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
care what your shoulders up you can't

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.010 
care what your shoulders up you can't
give<00:02:48.100> too<00:02:48.310> many<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.850> questions<00:02:49.570> all<00:02:49.720> at<00:02:49.810> once

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
give too many and questions all at once

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.620 
give too many and questions all at once
so<00:02:50.380> he<00:02:50.980> had<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.850> clear<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.540> up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
so he had to just get clear on going up

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.229 
so he had to just get clear on going up
and<00:02:53.049> then<00:02:53.320> go<00:02:53.410> again<00:02:53.560> once<00:02:54.549> you're<00:02:54.730> very<00:02:54.940> clear

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
and then go again once you're very clear

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.759 
and then go again once you're very clear
and<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.690> go<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.140> down<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.560> rhythm

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
and you can go up and down in a rhythm

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.070 
and you can go up and down in a rhythm
then<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.239> almost<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.780> want<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.989> get

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
then and you can almost you want to get

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.289 
then and you can almost you want to get
to<00:02:59.200> unconscious<00:02:59.590> incompetence<00:03:00.220> where<00:03:00.850> you're

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
to unconscious incompetence where you're

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.690 
to unconscious incompetence where you're
almost<00:03:01.680> doing<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.890> without<00:03:03.100> thinking<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.670> I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
almost doing it without thinking so I

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.970 
almost doing it without thinking so I
can<00:03:03.940> ask<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.299> what<00:03:04.720> two<00:03:04.900> times<00:03:04.930> four<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.440> and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
can ask you what two times four is and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.620 
can ask you what two times four is and
you'll<00:03:06.070> be<00:03:06.160> able<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.489> tell<00:03:06.700> me<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.330> not<00:03:07.450> to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
you'll be able to tell me if you not to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.190 
you'll be able to tell me if you not to
bother<00:03:08.610> without<00:03:09.610> having<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.269> then<00:03:10.930> lose

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
bother without having to then lose

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.360 
bother without having to then lose
you're<00:03:11.380> diagnosed<00:03:11.799> because<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.220> weren't

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
you're diagnosed because you weren't

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.100 
you're diagnosed because you weren't
focused<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.450> when<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.019> go

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
focused on that so when you can just go

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.600 
focused on that so when you can just go
up<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.410> down<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.860> horses<00:03:15.070> with<00:03:15.310> them<00:03:15.459> and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
up and down and the horses with them and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
up and down and the horses with them and
don't<00:03:15.730> need<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.970> think<00:03:16.150> about<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.480> too<00:03:16.600> much

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
don't need to think about it too much

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.150 
don't need to think about it too much
cool<00:03:17.200> you're<00:03:17.440> ready<00:03:17.590> for<00:03:17.799> diagonals<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:20.160> what

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
cool you're ready for diagonals so what

to<00:06:26.150> take<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.389> deep<00:06:26.599> breath<00:06:26.779> and<00:06:26.990> realize<00:06:27.139> that

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379 
to take a deep breath and realize that

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.860 
to take a deep breath and realize that
one<00:06:28.370> of<00:06:28.520> these<00:06:28.669> shoulders<00:06:29.150> is<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:29.479> forward

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
one of these shoulders is going forward

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.839 
one of these shoulders is going forward
at<00:06:29.960> any<00:06:30.050> given<00:06:30.379> time<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:31.279> inside<00:06:31.639> goes

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
at any given time the inside goes

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.279 
at any given time the inside goes
forward<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.300> outside<00:06:32.690> goes<00:06:32.900> forward<00:06:33.169> it

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
forward and the outside goes forward it

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:34.929 
forward and the outside goes forward it
simply<00:06:33.650> must<00:06:33.860> for<00:06:34.129> the<00:06:34.189> horse<00:06:34.370> to<00:06:34.490> be<00:06:34.520> trotting

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939 
simply must for the horse to be trotting

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.059 
simply must for the horse to be trotting
so<00:06:35.360> once<00:06:35.569> you're<00:06:36.020> clear<00:06:36.229> on<00:06:36.439> that<00:06:36.469> you<00:06:36.860> just

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069
