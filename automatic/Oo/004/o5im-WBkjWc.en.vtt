00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hi, I'm Monica Rangel, make up artist 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.200
 for lan with chile today we are going to make a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 very natural look with colors of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 spring but that is also very 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 wearable for daily life so that the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 look this look owes us or any other 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 the key is to have super skin 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 hydrated as our model makes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.949
 has a little bit of roses on the skin 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.080
 let's use this lancôme cream that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.760
 is the and drazen that will help us 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.489
 soothe the skin and make the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.160
 makeup last much longer we take 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.430
 just with the fingers we heat the cream 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.559
 on the hand and we're going to mix it with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 our basis of the day to make a look 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.170
 even more subtle and the idea of ​​a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.760
 invisible makeup but that at the same 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.190
 time is protecting the skin 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.190
 we started from the center out 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 and this will give us luminosity and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 same time it will last us all day 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 having been skin hydrated and with 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.430
 the corrector we will correct and illuminate 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.920
 different discoloration is the points to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 place in this case they will be in the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 front on the bridge of the nose in the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.470
 tear 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.870
 the ojera above the lips and a little 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.350
 on the chin with the same mixture that 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.470
 we had had before let's put it together and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.080
 with this we are going to blur inside 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 outwards gently let's start 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.920
 to blur 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.560
 on the eyelid also on the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.060
 lips and this is already going to start giving 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.060
 face size 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.479
 I'm going to give you light 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.080
 how we want a very natural look and very 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.030
 wearable but with spring colors 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.770
 what we are going to do is take a shadow 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.399
 golden 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.560
 put us in the hand and with our 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.170
 club look clear what we are going to do them 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.939
 let's put a little droplet what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.459
 we can stir a little bit until 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.420
 we create a color pill and we're going 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.760
 to put the tabs up 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.590
 with our finger 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.590
 following the shape of the eye 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.300
 to give the structure of the eyelid we go 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.840
 to use this color 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.080
 more orange 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.580
 and from outside to inside from outside 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.910
 inwards and with our finger 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.640
 following the eye's orbit 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 but give the structure and now is when 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.550
 we started to blur the shadow 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.570
 all the mobile eyelid we will use 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.570
 a brown color glued to the eyelashes of 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.990
 out inwards in movements of 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.840
 zig zag to illuminate the color that is going 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.160
 to give depth to the shadow of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 lashes and it's going to be that we do not need 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.390
 touch up during the day 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.760
 let's continue with the mirror effect 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.090
 that always what we do above 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.849
 we do below to give the idea of ​​a 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.610
 color gradient we took a bit of the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.620
 orange color that we had used 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.220
 previously and with this we are going to 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.220
 blur 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.960
 let's use the bus in love orange 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.660
 that is new to this collection that is a 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.810
 very fresh and very spring color , let 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.560
 to give small touches following the form 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.560
 of the lips 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.260
 and with what we left in the yolk of the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.770
 fingers and this is going to be the color of 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.770
 Our pride 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.019
 let's apply the cloud miradil about 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.390
 our hand and where we put the blush 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.420
 let's put a small dot and what 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.819
 let's blur so that the color 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.310
 Coral blur bus better last 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.040
 more time and luminosity of the face 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.420
 let's use and we're going to start 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.989
 in the root zig-zag we go up root and 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.989
 we climb 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.790
 with the tip of the brush only the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.790
 root let's touch 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.840
 and then a little bit the tips but 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.840
 first the root tips 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.480
 to finish our look we are going to use 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.370
 the product of star browns that is going to 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.810
 give a golden tone like on vacation 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.810
 like spring 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.699
 and just below the cheekbone gently 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.699
 we started to shape 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.139
 a little on the sides of the nose and with a 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:05.669
 broad brush let's blur to 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.669
 that there is no line 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.490
 and ready our soft makeup in 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.849
 warm colors with a coral tone in the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.849
 lips
