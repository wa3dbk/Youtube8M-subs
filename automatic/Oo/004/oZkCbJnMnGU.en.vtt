lot among bass players a lot of young

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.630 
lot among bass players a lot of young
players<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.020> ask<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.250> groove

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
players I ask you know what is a groove

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
players I ask you know what is a groove
or<00:00:20.910> how<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> come<00:00:21.480> up<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.630> original

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
or how do you come up with original

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.189 
or how do you come up with original
grooves<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.090> it's<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> hard<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.660> define

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
grooves and it's a hard thing to define

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.220 
grooves and it's a hard thing to define
exactly<00:00:26.420> but<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> those

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
exactly but I think it's one of those

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
exactly but I think it's one of those
things<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> hear<00:00:29.640> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
things that you know it when you hear it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.980 
things that you know it when you hear it
right<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.359> when<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> hear<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> song

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
right you know when you hear a song

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.310 
right you know when you hear a song
that's<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.410> grooving<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.099> well<00:00:33.320> but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that's really grooving really well but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
that's really grooving really well but
basically<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:35.040> short<00:00:35.309> answer<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
basically my short answer to that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
basically my short answer to that
question<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.770> groove<00:00:37.770> equals<00:00:38.309> repetition

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
question is groove equals repetition

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819 
question is groove equals repetition
that's<00:00:39.660> basically<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> comes<00:00:40.379> down<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that's basically what it comes down to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.970 
that's basically what it comes down to
rhythmic<00:00:41.250> repetition<00:00:41.910> okay<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.980> whatever

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
rhythmic repetition okay so whatever

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
rhythmic repetition okay so whatever
pattern<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.730> playing<00:00:45.000> over<00:00:45.360> whether<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
pattern you're playing over whether it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
pattern you're playing over whether it's
an<00:00:46.079> eighth<00:00:46.260> note<00:00:46.289> groove<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.070> sixteenth<00:00:47.489> note

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
an eighth note groove or sixteenth note

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
an eighth note groove or sixteenth note
groove<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.300> doesn't<00:00:48.570> matter

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
groove it doesn't matter

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
groove it doesn't matter
the<00:00:49.260> idea<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> commit<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> particular

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the idea is to commit to a particular

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.229 
the idea is to commit to a particular
rhythm<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.480> fits<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.840> grid<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.760> stick

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
rhythm that fits that grid and stick

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.400 
rhythm that fits that grid and stick
with<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> fit<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> different

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
with it and make it fit the different

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
with it and make it fit the different
changing<00:00:55.920> chords<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.550> lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.910> times<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> know

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
changing chords a lot of times you know

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
changing chords a lot of times you know
inexperienced<00:00:58.289> players<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> try

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
inexperienced players will kind of try

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.680 
inexperienced players will kind of try
one<00:00:59.370> idea<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.030> abandon<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> very

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
one idea and then abandon it very

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.229 
one idea and then abandon it very
quickly<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> try<00:01:01.320> something<00:01:01.559> else<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
quickly and try something else and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.009 
quickly and try something else and
abandon<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.570> quickly<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> try

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
abandon that very quickly and try

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
abandon that very quickly and try
something<00:01:04.229> else<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.680> never<00:01:04.860> settles<00:01:05.400> into

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
something else and it never settles into

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
something else and it never settles into
a<00:01:05.729> groove<00:01:06.290> but<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> idea<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.799> exercise

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a groove but the idea of this exercise

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
a groove but the idea of this exercise
is<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.119> any<00:01:09.330> rhythm<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.930> really

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
is that it could be any rhythm it really

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570 
is that it could be any rhythm it really
doesn't<00:01:10.409> matter<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> rhythm<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> as

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
doesn't matter what the rhythm is as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
doesn't matter what the rhythm is as
long<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> commit<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> play<00:01:13.080> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
long as you commit to it and play it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
long as you commit to it and play it
consistently<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.240> gonna

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
consistently so we're just gonna

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
consistently so we're just gonna
randomly<00:01:15.780> pick<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:16.409> notes<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.979> try

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
randomly pick some notes and try

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
randomly pick some notes and try
repeating<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.750> turns<00:01:18.990> into

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
repeating them and see if it turns into

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.249 
repeating them and see if it turns into
music<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.090> example<00:01:21.540> I'll<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.049> use

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
music and for this example I'll just use

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
music and for this example I'll just use
a<00:01:22.290> basic<00:01:22.590> rock<00:01:22.950> pattern<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.520> eighth<00:01:23.759> note

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
a basic rock pattern an eighth note

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.990 
a basic rock pattern an eighth note
groove<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.900> gonna<00:01:25.020> sound<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:29.000> one

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
groove it's gonna sound like this one

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
groove it's gonna sound like this one
two<00:01:30.270> three<00:01:30.570> four<00:01:30.810> five<00:01:31.110> six<00:01:31.350> seven<00:01:31.590> eight

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
two three four five six seven eight

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.149 
two three four five six seven eight
right<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> hear<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> drummers<00:01:33.570> hi-hat

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
right you can hear the drummers hi-hat

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
right you can hear the drummers hi-hat
counting<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.610> eighth<00:01:36.060> notes<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
counting off the eighth notes in the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.719 
counting off the eighth notes in the
grid<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> notes<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
have available to you in that groove
basically<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> very<00:01:41.400> common<00:01:41.759> pattern<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
basically and a very common pattern to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.960 
basically and a very common pattern to
play<00:01:42.420> over<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> beat<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.970> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
play over a beat like this would be just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
play over a beat like this would be just
to<00:01:45.090> play<00:01:45.270> every<00:01:45.570> eighth<00:01:45.720> note<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> maybe<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to play every eighth note and maybe on a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.560 
to play every eighth note and maybe on a
simple<00:01:47.490> rock<00:01:47.670> tune<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> might<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.390> play

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
simple rock tune you might just play

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.870 
simple rock tune you might just play
just<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.930> roots<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> chords<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
just the roots of the chords and it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:04.800 
just the roots of the chords and it
might<00:01:51.030> sound<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.210> this

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.670 

something<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.409> would<00:02:06.530> be

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
something like that and that would be

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.929 
something like that and that would be
perfectly<00:02:07.039> appropriate<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.759> lot<00:02:07.909> of

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
perfectly appropriate in a lot of

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.920 
perfectly appropriate in a lot of
situations<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.670> maybe<00:02:10.940> let's<00:02:11.269> say<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.750> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
situations but maybe let's say that that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.140 
situations but maybe let's say that that
pattern<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:13.010> playing<00:02:13.400> all<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> eighth<00:02:13.849> notes

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
pattern of playing all the eighth notes

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.120 
pattern of playing all the eighth notes
on<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.660> route<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.080> getting<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.709> stale

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
on the route is getting a little stale

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100 
on the route is getting a little stale
for<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.760> mean<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.180> been<00:02:17.360> done<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.599> lot<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
for you I mean it's been done a lot and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.110 
for you I mean it's been done a lot and
maybe<00:02:18.560> that's<00:02:18.830> just<00:02:18.890> become<00:02:19.310> an<00:02:19.459> old<00:02:19.790> stale

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
maybe that's just become an old stale

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.430 
maybe that's just become an old stale
habit<00:02:20.540> for<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:20.989> want<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.170> break<00:02:21.319> out

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
habit for you and you want to break out

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.360 
habit for you and you want to break out
of<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.830> play<00:02:21.950> something<00:02:22.250> different

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
of that and play something different

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.339 
of that and play something different
well<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.330> could<00:02:23.480> really<00:02:23.599> play<00:02:23.840> anything<00:02:24.230> as

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
well you could really play anything as

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.750 
well you could really play anything as
long<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.769> fits<00:02:24.890> within<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.370> eighth<00:02:25.550> note

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
long as it fits within that eighth note

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.140 
long as it fits within that eighth note
framework<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.830> could<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.250> randomly<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
framework so you could just randomly you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.699 
framework so you could just randomly you
know<00:02:29.269> write<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> bunch<00:02:29.780> eight<00:02:30.080> eighth<00:02:30.260> notes<00:02:30.560> on

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
know write a bunch eight eighth notes on

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.759 
know write a bunch eight eighth notes on
a<00:02:30.739> page<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.220> erase<00:02:31.459> half<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.090> them<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.650> know

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
a page and erase half of them you know

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.710 
a page and erase half of them you know
let's<00:02:34.010> say<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.549> want<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.000> play<00:02:35.120> I'll<00:02:35.420> play<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
let's say I want to play I'll play the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.620 
let's say I want to play I'll play the
first<00:02:36.110> beat<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.760> I'm<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.030> gonna<00:02:38.150> use<00:02:38.330> sort

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
first beat and I'm just gonna use sort

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.970 
first beat and I'm just gonna use sort
of<00:02:38.660> an<00:02:38.780> E<00:02:38.900> minor<00:02:39.080> chord<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.680> E<00:02:39.769> minor

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
of an E minor chord and E minor

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.699 
of an E minor chord and E minor
pentatonic<00:02:40.340> scale<00:02:40.959> for<00:02:41.959> my<00:02:42.049> example<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.530> you

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
pentatonic scale for my example that you

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
pentatonic scale for my example that you
could<00:02:42.860> apply<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.280> any<00:02:43.489> court<00:02:43.849> or<00:02:44.000> any

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
could apply this to any court or any

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.809 
could apply this to any court or any
scale<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:46.130> let's<00:02:46.280> say<00:02:46.400> I'll<00:02:46.519> play<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> first

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
scale so let's say I'll play the first

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.180 
scale so let's say I'll play the first
eighth<00:02:47.150> note<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.319> I'll<00:02:48.440> leave<00:02:48.650> out<00:02:48.830> two

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
eighth note and then I'll leave out two

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
eighth note and then I'll leave out two
and<00:02:49.310> three<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.880> I'll<00:02:50.690> play<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.140> fourth<00:02:51.380> one

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and three and I'll play the fourth one

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.979 
and three and I'll play the fourth one
and<00:02:52.130> I'll<00:02:52.819> leave<00:02:53.000> out<00:02:53.090> five<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.510> six<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.900> I'll

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
and I'll leave out five and six and I'll

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.960 
and I'll leave out five and six and I'll
play<00:02:54.110> seven<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.560> eight<00:02:54.650> okay<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.430> instead<00:02:55.760> of

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
play seven and eight okay so instead of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.509 
play seven and eight okay so instead of
playing<00:02:56.299> one<00:02:56.870> two<00:02:57.079> three<00:02:57.500> four<00:02:57.829> five<00:02:58.190> six

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
playing one two three four five six

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.470 
playing one two three four five six
seven<00:02:58.790> eight

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
seven eight

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.530 
seven eight
I'm<00:03:00.200> gonna<00:03:00.380> play<00:03:00.620> one<00:03:01.160> two<00:03:01.459> three<00:03:01.849> four<00:03:02.180> five

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
I'm gonna play one two three four five

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
I'm gonna play one two three four five
six<00:03:02.900> seventeen<00:03:03.650> okay

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
six seventeen okay

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.720 
six seventeen okay
and<00:03:05.769> let's<00:03:06.769> see<00:03:06.890> how<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.040> sounds<00:03:07.370> with<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and let's see how that sounds with the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.539 
and let's see how that sounds with the
same<00:03:07.940> beat<00:03:14.709> how<00:03:15.709> did<00:03:15.829> that<00:03:15.920> sound<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.370> sound

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
same beat how did that sound it sound

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.120 
same beat how did that sound it sound
like<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.670> groove<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.950> probably<00:03:18.950> not

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
like a groove to you probably not

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.949 
like a groove to you probably not
because<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.489> only<00:03:19.609> played<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.940> once

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
because I only played it once

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.360 
because I only played it once
it<00:03:21.170> sounds<00:03:21.500> pretty<00:03:21.590> random<00:03:22.010> if<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.190> play

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
it sounds pretty random if I play

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.699 
it sounds pretty random if I play
something<00:03:22.670> like<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.000> once<00:03:23.530> but<00:03:24.530> if<00:03:24.620> I

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
something like that just once but if I

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.699 
something like that just once but if I
play<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:25.069> three<00:03:25.250> or<00:03:25.280> four<00:03:25.400> times<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:27.350> start<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
play it three or four times you start to

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.349 
play it three or four times you start to
settle<00:03:27.920> into<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.340> as<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.519> listener<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.329> a

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
settle into it as a listener and as a

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.940 
settle into it as a listener and as a
player<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.870> start<00:03:30.230> getting<00:03:30.440> used<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.769> and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
player you start getting used to it and

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.930 
player you start getting used to it and
the<00:03:31.069> players<00:03:31.250> around<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:31.670> will<00:03:31.850> start

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
the players around you will start

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.309 
the players around you will start
getting<00:03:32.269> used<00:03:32.389> to<00:03:32.450> what<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.959> groove<00:03:33.170> that

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
getting used to what you the groove that

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.960 
getting used to what you the groove that
you've<00:03:33.440> established<00:03:33.650> as<00:03:34.310> long<00:03:34.489> as<00:03:34.609> you<00:03:34.700> stick

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
you've established as long as you stick

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.789 
you've established as long as you stick
with<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.450> everybody<00:03:36.380> will<00:03:36.470> kind<00:03:36.680> of

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
with it and everybody will kind of

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.410 
with it and everybody will kind of
adjust<00:03:37.160> their<00:03:37.340> parts<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.730> fit<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.239> it'll

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
adjust their parts to fit that and it'll

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.750 
adjust their parts to fit that and it'll
start<00:03:38.630> feeling<00:03:38.930> like<00:03:38.989> music<00:03:39.380> hopefully<00:03:39.760> so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
start feeling like music hopefully so

00:03:40.760 --> 00:04:04.660 
start feeling like music hopefully so
let<00:03:40.880> me<00:03:40.940> try<00:03:41.060> repeating<00:03:41.450> that

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.970 

okay<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.720> see<00:04:06.960> it<00:04:07.080> starts<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.470> work<00:04:07.590> after

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
okay so you see it starts to work after

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.340 
okay so you see it starts to work after
a<00:04:08.010> little<00:04:08.190> while<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.670> did<00:04:09.240> put<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.660> couple

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
a little while I did put in a couple

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.750 
a little while I did put in a couple
different<00:04:10.500> notes<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.220> couple<00:04:11.400> slight

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
different notes and a couple slight

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.960 
different notes and a couple slight
variations<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:14.280> line<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:14.580> basically<00:04:14.880> I

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
variations in the line but basically I

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.580 
variations in the line but basically I
was<00:04:15.120> sticking<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.630> same<00:04:15.870> rhythm<00:04:16.049> all<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
was sticking to that same rhythm all the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.500 
was sticking to that same rhythm all the
way<00:04:16.680> through<00:04:16.920> it's<00:04:17.790> okay<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.150> put<00:04:18.359> little

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
way through it's okay to put little

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.449 
way through it's okay to put little
embellishments<00:04:19.260> or<00:04:19.470> little<00:04:19.769> variations<00:04:20.280> in

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
embellishments or little variations in

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.070 
embellishments or little variations in
every<00:04:20.730> four<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.000> ours<00:04:21.209> or<00:04:21.480> every<00:04:21.690> eight<00:04:21.780> bars

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
every four of ours or every eight bars

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.780 
every four of ours or every eight bars
just<00:04:22.200> like<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> drummer<00:04:22.860> would<00:04:23.100> do<00:04:23.280> would<00:04:23.610> play

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
just like a drummer would do would play

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.180 
just like a drummer would do would play
a<00:04:23.820> fill<00:04:24.120> at<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> end<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.050> each<00:04:25.140> section<00:04:25.440> that's

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
a fill at the end of each section that's

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.530 
a fill at the end of each section that's
fine<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.640> long<00:04:26.670> as<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.970> come<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.450> your

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
fine as long as you come back to your

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.670 
fine as long as you come back to your
established<00:04:28.080> rhythm<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.500> stay

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
established rhythm and you stay

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.750 
established rhythm and you stay
committed<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:29.430> you've<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.700> be

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
committed to that so you've got to be

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.040 
committed to that so you've got to be
very<00:04:29.940> conscious<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.540> rhythm<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:30.930> you're

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
very conscious of the rhythm that you're

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.820 
very conscious of the rhythm that you're
playing<00:04:31.350> that's<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.830> idea<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:34.350> I'm<00:04:34.440> gonna<00:04:34.560> try

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
playing that's the idea so I'm gonna try

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.530 
playing that's the idea so I'm gonna try
one<00:04:35.160> more<00:04:35.280> variation<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.090> eighth<00:04:36.360> note

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
one more variation on this eighth note

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.120 
one more variation on this eighth note
pattern<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.350> as<00:04:37.470> an<00:04:37.560> example<00:04:37.890> I'm<00:04:38.040> gonna

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
pattern just as an example I'm gonna

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.580 
pattern just as an example I'm gonna
really<00:04:38.340> strip<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.700> down<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.240> play<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.410> three

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
really strip it down and play just three

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.840 
really strip it down and play just three
notes<00:04:40.710> out<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.100> bar

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
notes out of the bar

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.730 
notes out of the bar
and<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.420> mean<00:04:42.540> only<00:04:42.570> got<00:04:42.870> one<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.590> make<00:04:43.710> it

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
and I mean only got one just to make it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.000 
and I mean only got one just to make it
interesting<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:45.660> let's<00:04:46.080> play<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.560> second

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
interesting so let's play the second

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.060 
interesting so let's play the second
note<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.850> third<00:04:48.090> note<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.860> last

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
instead of one two three four five six

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.610 
instead of one two three four five six
17<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:56.100> gonna<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.460> one<00:04:57.180> two<00:04:57.540> three<00:04:57.930> four<00:04:58.260> five

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
six seven eight

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.970 
six seven eight
that<00:05:00.720> should<00:05:00.960> be<00:05:01.050> interesting<00:05:01.500> let's<00:05:01.770> see<00:05:01.919> if

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
that should be interesting let's see if

00:05:01.980 --> 00:06:02.810 
that should be interesting let's see if
I<00:05:02.040> can<00:05:02.190> play

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.910 

okay<00:06:03.820> I<00:06:03.970> got<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> little<00:06:04.360> bit<00:06:04.450> silly<00:06:04.630> there<00:06:04.930> but

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
okay I got a little bit silly there but

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.110 
okay I got a little bit silly there but
you<00:06:06.040> get<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.250> idea<00:06:06.280> even<00:06:06.640> something<00:06:06.910> as

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
you get the idea even something as

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.360 
you get the idea even something as
random<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.780> arbitrary<00:06:07.930> as<00:06:08.410> that<00:06:08.650> can<00:06:09.160> work

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
random and arbitrary as that can work

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.070 
random and arbitrary as that can work
actually<00:06:09.820> if<00:06:09.880> you<00:06:09.940> play<00:06:10.120> it<00:06:10.210> consistently<00:06:10.780> and

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
actually if you play it consistently and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.020 
actually if you play it consistently and
of<00:06:11.980> course<00:06:12.190> if<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.370> was<00:06:12.460> playing<00:06:12.640> with<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:12.820> real

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
of course if I was playing with a real

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.090 
of course if I was playing with a real
drummer<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.690> played<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.110> groove<00:06:14.560> as<00:06:14.740> odd<00:06:14.920> as

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
drummer and played a groove as odd as

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.500 
drummer and played a groove as odd as
that<00:06:15.130> he'd<00:06:15.610> probably<00:06:15.910> had<00:06:16.000> just<00:06:16.030> what<00:06:16.300> he<00:06:16.420> was

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
that he'd probably had just what he was

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.360 
that he'd probably had just what he was
playing<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:17.410> match<00:06:17.560> what<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.830> was<00:06:17.950> doing<00:06:18.160> even

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
playing to match what I was doing even

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.340 
playing to match what I was doing even
better<00:06:18.600> but<00:06:19.600> even<00:06:19.810> with<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.110> straight

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
better but even with this straight

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.960 
better but even with this straight
eighth<00:06:20.470> note<00:06:20.740> groove<00:06:21.010> I<00:06:21.220> think<00:06:21.370> it<00:06:21.460> works<00:06:21.670> as

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
eighth note groove I think it works as

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.100 
eighth note groove I think it works as
long<00:06:22.120> as<00:06:22.240> you<00:06:22.300> commit<00:06:22.630> to<00:06:22.750> it<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:22.990> play<00:06:23.080> it

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
long as you commit to it and play it

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.840 
long as you commit to it and play it
consistently<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:23.830> by<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.310> way<00:06:24.490> you<00:06:24.550> can<00:06:24.730> use

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
consistently and by the way you can use

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.030 
consistently and by the way you can use
the<00:06:25.000> same<00:06:25.210> idea<00:06:25.240> with<00:06:25.960> any<00:06:26.230> kind<00:06:26.590> of<00:06:26.710> grid<00:06:26.920> it

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
the same idea with any kind of grid it

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.980 
the same idea with any kind of grid it
doesn't<00:06:27.280> have<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:27.490> be<00:06:27.580> a<00:06:27.610> rock<00:06:27.850> beat<00:06:28.120> you<00:06:28.870> could

doesn't have to be a rock beat you could
do<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.170> same<00:06:29.320> thing<00:06:29.560> with<00:06:29.680> sixteenth<00:06:30.100> notes

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
do the same thing with sixteenth notes

on a funk groove or with triplets on a
12-8<00:06:34.150> groove<00:06:34.620> it'll<00:06:35.620> work<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:36.550> might<00:06:36.970> come<00:06:37.150> up

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
12-8 groove it'll work you might come up

12-8 groove it'll work you might come up
with<00:06:37.270> some<00:06:37.540> very<00:06:37.750> interesting<00:06:37.810> music<00:06:38.560> that

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
with some very interesting music that

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.840 
with some very interesting music that
way<00:06:38.830> actually<00:06:39.040> that<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.430> would<00:06:39.550> never<00:06:39.700> have

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
way actually that you would never have

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.780 
way actually that you would never have
thought<00:06:39.880> of<00:06:40.180> otherwise<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.620> give<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:41.890> try

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
thought of otherwise so give it a try

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.220 
thought of otherwise so give it a try
I<00:06:42.820> do<00:06:43.150> recommend<00:06:43.540> if<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:43.780> try<00:06:43.960> this<00:06:44.020> with

I do recommend if you try this with

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.420 
I do recommend if you try this with
something<00:06:44.410> like<00:06:44.530> sixteenth<00:06:45.040> notes<00:06:45.220> things

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
something like sixteenth notes things

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.800 
something like sixteenth notes things
can<00:06:45.610> get<00:06:45.700> very<00:06:45.880> complicated<00:06:46.240> so<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:46.630> might

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
can get very complicated so you might

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.300 
can get very complicated so you might
want<00:06:46.990> to<00:06:47.050> actually<00:06:47.200> write<00:06:47.590> out<00:06:47.800> the<00:06:47.950> rhythm<00:06:48.100> on
