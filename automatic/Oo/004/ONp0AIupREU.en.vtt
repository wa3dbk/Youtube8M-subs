00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 this is following the junction is 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.080
 made for antonio cairoli who in the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 room lenient wheel yeah 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.630
 actually it'll start to become 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.250
 complicated for clement of room viala 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 nevertheless there was a beautiful 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.640
 opportunity to win against the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 double and italian because we start 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.529
 to realize that on a regular basis that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 was going to be complicated to come back to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.080
 contact even though he was really not 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.599
 far and he chained the good 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 very long times of room 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.000
 the small fall of antonio cairoli which 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 was a real bargain could not 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 take a lead of about 4 seconds 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 on got pieroni and here we are in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 last round terol is not there yet in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 the road the banners hall lake leman 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 frankly me I went there I get dressed 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.010
 and especially the wind of that I think he 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.440
 will keep this first place against 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.910
 antonio cairoli 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 he slowed down a little bit to take away 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 role he has reperduated exactly the same 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 where he had fallen back had done 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 his little mistake of things but there he 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.440
 is very very close to it anyway 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.440
 it is very very hot antonio cairoli 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.210
 he feels the rounded up his 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.590
 translators for speed 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.420
 and that's where it usually goes 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.200
 attention actually he recovers a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.210
 double center here is the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.560
 only to do that was fine slate 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.289
 who did an extraordinary race 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.549
 since released from what they find they 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.259
 deserve to really illiberize his victory 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.000
 in front of rooms there is no problem 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 because it was very, very sparse and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 very fast and it's won 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.719
 victory of clÃ©ment desalle facing 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.369
 antonio cairoli beautiful way gorgeous 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.049
 race 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.719
 so small mistake others of cairoli 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.250
 who comes to congratulate Clement this is the 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.200
 fair play of the Italian driver 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.390
 and then we'll wait for a good moment 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.720
 before finding jeremy van horebeek 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.000

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.000
