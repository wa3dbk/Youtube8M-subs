for<00:00:49.920> us<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> enjoy<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> theory<00:00:52.110> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
for us to enjoy but I have a theory in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
for us to enjoy but I have a theory in
my<00:00:52.770> last<00:00:52.980> review<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.340> mentioned<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.000> might

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
my last review I mentioned that it might

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.880 
my last review I mentioned that it might
be<00:00:54.449> Reggie<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.230> theory<00:00:55.440> behind<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
be Reggie and my theory behind this is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.599 
be Reggie and my theory behind this is
that<00:00:56.160> somehow<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:56.940> came<00:00:57.480> back<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> Japan<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
that somehow he came back to Japan and

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
that somehow he came back to Japan and
decided<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> make<00:00:59.850> own<00:01:00.480> fighting<00:01:00.809> style<00:01:01.199> Jigen

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
decided to make own fighting style Jigen

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.240 
decided to make own fighting style Jigen
holu<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.539> basically<00:01:03.539> he<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.650> focused<00:01:04.949> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
holu and basically he got so focused on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
holu and basically he got so focused on
it<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.580> he<00:01:05.670> completely<00:01:05.909> forgot<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.390> all

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it that he completely forgot about all

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
it that he completely forgot about all
his<00:01:06.990> friends<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.740> everybody<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.340> Japan<00:01:08.610> even

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
his friends and everybody in Japan even

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
his friends and everybody in Japan even
say<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> he<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.130> decided<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.700> solely

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
say and he just decided to just solely

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.980 
say and he just decided to just solely
focus<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> developing<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> technique<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
focus on developing the technique and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.240 
focus on developing the technique and
basically<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.110> lost<00:01:16.290> touch<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
basically he lost touch it's like with

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
basically he lost touch it's like with
everybody<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:18.960> theory

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
everybody and this is where my theory

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
everybody and this is where my theory
comes<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:20.490> everybody<00:01:20.970> else<00:01:21.150> where

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
comes in with about everybody else where

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
comes in with about everybody else where
