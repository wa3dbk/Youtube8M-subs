00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.910 

when<00:00:00.450> we<00:00:00.570> add<00:00:00.750> its<00:00:00.960> exact<00:00:01.319> positive<00:00:01.800> and

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
when we add its exact positive and

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.249 
when we add its exact positive and
negative<00:00:02.250> numbers<00:00:02.520> it's<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> battle<00:00:03.720> they

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
negative numbers it's like a battle they

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.749 
negative numbers it's like a battle they
are<00:00:04.440> battling<00:00:04.710> each<00:00:05.040> other<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.549> number

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
are battling each other on the number

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.730 
are battling each other on the number
line<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.150> let's<00:00:06.390> take<00:00:06.569> some<00:00:06.750> examples<00:00:06.810> don't

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
line so let's take some examples don't

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.259 
line so let's take some examples don't
say<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.480> negative<00:00:09.480> 3<00:00:09.960> plus<00:00:10.650> 5<00:00:11.460> now

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
say that we have negative 3 plus 5 now

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.759 
say that we have negative 3 plus 5 now
we<00:00:12.300> know<00:00:12.509> from<00:00:12.690> class<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> negatives

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
we know from class that the negatives

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.189 
we know from class that the negatives
are<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.370> side<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.599> zero<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
are on this side of the zero and the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.500 
are on this side of the zero and the
positives<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.220> side<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.789> zero<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.420> if

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
positives on this side of the zero so if

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.779 
positives on this side of the zero so if
we<00:00:18.600> start<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.960> 0<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.560> say<00:00:19.740> negative<00:00:20.189> 3<00:00:20.520> we

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we start at 0 and we say negative 3 we

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.830 
we start at 0 and we say negative 3 we
go<00:00:20.880> 1<00:00:21.330> &amp;<00:00:21.869> 2<00:00:22.109> &amp;<00:00:22.590> 3<00:00:22.789> negative<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.480> then<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> go

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
go 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 negative but then to go

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
go 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 negative but then to go
positive<00:00:25.199> 5<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.310> back<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> other

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
positive 5 we can go back the other

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.710 
positive 5 we can go back the other
direction<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.720> 1<00:00:28.170> 2<00:00:28.859> 3<00:00:28.970> 4<00:00:29.970> &amp;

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
direction so we're going to go 1 2 3 4 &amp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.950 
direction so we're going to go 1 2 3 4 &amp;
5<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.130> end<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.719> positive<00:00:34.219> 2<00:00:35.960> positive

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
5 and we end up on positive 2 positive

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.410 
5 and we end up on positive 2 positive
is<00:00:37.260> 1<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.590> battle<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.850> let's<00:00:39.270> do

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
another one let's say negative 2 minus 4

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.940 
another one let's say negative 2 minus 4
all<00:00:45.210> righty<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.140> we're<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.350> start<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.800> at

0 we're gonna go negatives right now
negative<00:00:48.960> 1<00:00:49.410> negative<00:00:49.680> 2<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:50.969> we're

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
negative 1 negative 2 and then we're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
negative 1 negative 2 and then we're
also<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> continue<00:00:51.690> negative<00:00:52.559> negative

1 negative 2 negative 3 negative 4 and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.490 
1 negative 2 negative 3 negative 4 and
we<00:00:56.969> ended<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.539> negative<00:00:58.320> 1<00:00:58.559> 2<00:00:58.859> 3<00:00:59.129> 4<00:00:59.489> 5<00:00:59.730> &amp;<00:01:00.059> 6

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
we ended up at negative 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
we ended up at negative 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6
negative<00:01:01.500> 6<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> negatives<00:01:02.699> won<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> battle

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
negative 6 and negatives won this battle

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.380 
negative 6 and negatives won this battle
now<00:01:04.170> let's<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.860> let's<00:01:05.489> say<00:01:06.710> positive

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
now let's do one more let's say positive

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
now let's do one more let's say positive
5<00:01:09.710> minus<00:01:10.710> 2<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.619> 0

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
5 minus 2 so we're gonna start here at 0

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
5 minus 2 so we're gonna start here at 0
and<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.220> positive<00:01:14.490> 5<00:01:15.060> 1<00:01:15.689> 2<00:01:16.140> 3<00:01:16.590> 4<00:01:17.100> 5<00:01:17.600> now<00:01:18.600> we're

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and go positive 5 1 2 3 4 5 now we're

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.730 
and go positive 5 1 2 3 4 5 now we're
going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:18.930> negative<00:01:19.710> 2<00:01:20.360> 1<00:01:21.360> 2<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.170> we're

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
going to go negative 2 1 2 and we're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
going to go negative 2 1 2 and we're
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> end<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.400> positive<00:01:24.090> 1<00:01:24.360> 2<00:01:24.869> &amp;<00:01:25.229> 3<00:01:26.030> now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
going to end up on positive 1 2 &amp; 3 now

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.929 
going to end up on positive 1 2 &amp; 3 now
if<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.240> look<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> battle<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.729> one

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
if we look at this as a battle the one

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
if we look at this as a battle the one
that<00:01:30.119> has<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.630> most<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> biggest

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that has the most or the biggest

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.359 
that has the most or the biggest
physical<00:01:32.670> number<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> win<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> 5

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
physical number is going to win out so 5

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
physical number is going to win out so 5
was<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> big<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.180> physical<00:01:36.840> number<00:01:37.170> than<00:01:37.530> 3<00:01:37.890> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
was a big your physical number than 3 so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.030 
was a big your physical number than 3 so
we're<00:01:38.220> gonna<00:01:38.310> end<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.119> positives

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
we're gonna end up with more positives

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
we're gonna end up with more positives
in<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> case<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.670> 5<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> bigger

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
in this case down here 5 was the bigger

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.590 
in this case down here 5 was the bigger
positive<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.950> bigger<00:01:44.189> physical<00:01:44.850> number<00:01:45.180> than

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
positive the bigger physical number than

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
positive the bigger physical number than
negative<00:01:46.110> 2<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.500> our<00:01:46.619> answer<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
negative 2 so our answer is going to be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
negative 2 so our answer is going to be
positive<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.170> case<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.590> went<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> same

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
positive in this case we went the same

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
positive in this case we went the same
direction<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.060> negatives<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.720> all

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
direction so the negatives we had all

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
direction so the negatives we had all
around<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.799> brings<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> song<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
around and that brings up the song we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.830 
around and that brings up the song we
did<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.939> class<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.619> same<00:01:55.619> signs<00:01:56.219> add

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
did in class which was same signs add

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.060 
did in class which was same signs add
and<00:01:57.840> keep<00:01:59.180> different<00:02:00.180> signs<00:02:00.719> subtract<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and keep different signs subtract and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.959 
and keep different signs subtract and
keep<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:03.119> sign<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.950> larger<00:02:04.950> number<00:02:05.340> then

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
keep the sign of the larger number then

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.780 
keep the sign of the larger number then
you'll<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.299> exact
