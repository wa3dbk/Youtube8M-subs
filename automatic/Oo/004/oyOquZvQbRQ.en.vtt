00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:12.320
 that in this new video tutorial of 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.320
 transporters 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.799
 any type of block at least 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.570
 of pressure plates and what we have 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.270
 the next command that I will leave you in 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.270
 and 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.670
 to simplify it free or in 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.090
 they gave us 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 that beach clothes 137 that's the leader of the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 block with more than 64 is the amount 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.400
 if they want everything puts the blocks of 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.720
 command 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.230
 I do it to be like the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.230
 decor 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.859
 we wanted 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.490
 next is what it is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 and the next thing that would be would be a 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.710
 ah 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 until then 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.270
 what we are going to notice 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.370
 nothing else these three letters called xy 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.610
 7 that we will notice those three letters 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.370
 good first pocket note 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.720
 the first numbers that you make before 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.720
 the comma at least in x would be 8 8 887 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.450
 and it would be 4 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.450
 in the true would be eight hundred and sixty 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.290
 and here we put the following command that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.290
 I will also leave them 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 and we put another 87 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.130
 8 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.989
 800 points 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.989
 and let's go 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.269
 we do not use the pressure plate and 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.269
 ready 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.600
 that's why he has too much 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.600
 we can not have transported 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.030
