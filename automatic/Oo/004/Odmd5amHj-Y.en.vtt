 A short interview Monday morning is this time that you don't answer yourself 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.389
 because in recent years we have played hélène every country our turn 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.439
 killing figure in the first place and becomes henkjan 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.130
 a few and 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 then came 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 he can tell you if that is from gerard joling for more freedom 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 the pelvis 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.380

 the ict sector you always for that matter it is all explain what is the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.870
 3 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.030
 at nec 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.290
 in 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 the borculo neede channel 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.690
 but those were my questions and I have no more questions but the lamas 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.000
 the books 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 too many more questions and then can play it is namely 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.800
 the question round is i am and that i am against arrow endstra 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.939
 Amman 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.319
 and the first location for your dolphinarium deployment 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.940
 it seems nice to see 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.380
 she was supposed to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.650
 we are not all free 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 At this time 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.049
 of course it is 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.289
 I say goodbye to your brother 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.169
 what nonsense 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.169
 we have a brother or sister 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.479
 you may be driven 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.369
 with that ball 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.809
 then you have to be a team 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.809
 yes I do not have to ask 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.859
 also better against andorra drilling platforms 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.139
 that reminds me a bit 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.849
 falling on the mat is not a bit weird from a drilling platform 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 all men 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.879
 it was that says 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 i like words 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:04.180
 yes then but why do you ask that sometimes the nicest thing there is 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.179
 for interested parties 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.969
 Yes that is 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.289
 that is a crap ed 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.079
 Typically on the right you might have a little oil for mahut rail a bit 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.519
 dry 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.009
 werder bremen third in this week in a home 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.990

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.969
 ajax b2 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969
 of course I love going to work out 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.769
 that made the following years very badly damaged after a while ago 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.459
 what they think is a bit more than a year earlier while on a shrink 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.629
 Always wanted to know where your children are and for two years already 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.329
 run small projects 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.329
 but it is also good if the NS stops 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.019
 there we go to the united nations 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.079
 I also have a little bit 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.579
 could not follow 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.840
 she said that on Tuesday 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 Editors 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.620
 the layoffs during a massive fight 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.900
 it is necessary 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900
 tents on Boxing Day 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 to make the situation too high 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.749
 actually have 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.360
 takes this away
