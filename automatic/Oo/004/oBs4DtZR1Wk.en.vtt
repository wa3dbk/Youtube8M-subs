 the D 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.310
 I think I would teach the willy reds 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 first because the same as if they already saw 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 this one already saw that that then and to teach 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 of vegeta more in willy rex signal for 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.250
 they are more or less good you know that 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.470
 there is good if they saw the video because 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.530
 it's fine at plant distances but 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.740
 well, if you did not see it, well here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.100
