00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.059
 yes hello people today i have one again 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.520
 easter egg and this time it's about 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.800
 plant the game against zombies 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.240
 and I'm on it right now 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.170
 in my opinion the highest point of the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 map in the area antenna 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.660
 At the top of this antenna tower 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.370
 We'll look again where I'm right 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 will be able to do that at the very top left 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.820
 you really do not miss it 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.010
 you do not necessarily have to turn up here 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.420
 but I reach the easter egg 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.650
 make it from up here you are just one 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.090
 I have a better overview I'll show you 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.160
 very briefly probably now is first time 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.160
 we climb down a floor 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.350
 and then we go to this one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.840
 Drahtseil what's behind here more 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 or direction city shows 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 Just slip down there as well 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 you could see the lower right you could 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 also run and run behind to the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
 location 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.120
 That would be no problem if you 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 do not want to climb high first 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 after we got the first 13 behind us 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.660
 we go directly to the next thing we did 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.660
 immediately continues 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.930
 that's the way we are already 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.630
 it's almost over here now 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.189
 take care that they do not fall off 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.509
 happened twice 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.780
 again to the survey that she looks like 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.409
 where i exactly style just in case you 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.409
 would like to run 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.750
 I have to find the way first 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 got there before but since I actually 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.350
 you can directly at the stone at the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.850
 Iran just comes up one more time 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 go and then right around the corner 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.220
 and then you look at this 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.740
 Leap down here a flower this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.560
 flower you have to use so easy 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.480
 down a floor and click with 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 ex or square and then you are 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.810
 you are actually in the middle is already 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.130
 the bike is not too much now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.270
 what happens here you can yes 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.220
 like to see for yourself 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 I'm just saying that there are several 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.570
 waves with different strong zombies 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.620
 and I do not have it myself 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 found out if there maybe 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.260
 somehow reward for when there is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.260
 all worlds creates 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.760
 after we have explored everything 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.740
 you just this world again 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 leave by simply left her 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.880
 at this brand at this house like 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.130
 always goes through this door and then 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.080
 Are you right back outside where he is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.380
 You started until the next one 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.380
