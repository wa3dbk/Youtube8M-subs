00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.310
 greetings and welcome all my name is 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.840
 track the east is the art design of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.500
 nails on which we will be working 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.690
 now let's start for the first design 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.460
 I started by painting my nail in half with 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.290
 a white enamel and now I'm 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.809
 using a silver-colored glaze 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.970
 and I'm doing a half circle more 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.980
 big up and another smaller one 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.170
 in the area below on the side now 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
 using a brush to draw with 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 a black color I'm painting two lines 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.520
 black going down curving the and 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.470
 I will do the same two lines going 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.200
 upwards curving them a little bit more 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.560
 Now I'm going to cross my first 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.840
 two black lines with a white color and 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.840
 I will do the same in the area below 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.770
 followed by this I'm going to make a line 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.140
 of little black dots going up and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.150
 another going down now I'm going to 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.210
 delineate the area below so that I have 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.130
 a well-matched line and after 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.380
 this nothing else apply its gloss coat 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.990
 To seal your design properly let's move to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.240
 design that follows for this design I started 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.490
 for applying a white color to me 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.950
 the previous nail and now I'm using 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.610
 silver glitter enamel by 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.800
 on top of white enamel 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.680
 now be next to the nail I'm going to paint 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.900
 a flower with four petals my petals 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.150
 they have the shape of almond and this is 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.070
 nothing more like the skeleton of the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.570
 petals of the flower then I'm going to 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.150
 make a little bit bigger but they're going to 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.710
 be four petals now I'm going to go in and 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.000
 I'm going to paint each of them a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.000
 little bit bigger 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.560
 I'm also going to fill in the area 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.540
 center with the black color using a 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.550
 white color now I'm going to make a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830
 limited to finite in the center of each 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.920
 of the petals of my flower and I'm also going 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.720
 to delineate one side of each other 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.720
 of my petals with white color 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 Now I'm going to add the brightness in color 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.920
 silver in the center of my flower towards 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.000
 the side of my flower I'm going to paint two 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.659
 curved lines crossing down 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.730
 I'm going to paint another line in black and 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.549
 now in white I will cross one 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 second curved line your last step is 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.000
 Apply a gloss coat 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.430
 transparent to seal your design 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.319
 let's move to the art that follows for this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.870
 design I started in the same way with a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.940
 enamel in white and now towards the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.140
 half I'm adding a glaze in 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.700
 black color 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.500
 Now I'm going to apply a glaze 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.720
 transparent in the center so that it 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.180
 do for tastes to this area and thus be able 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.250
 add 5 crystallites going down 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.410
 another option that you have to fix 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.230
 surely its crystallites is to use 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.700
 special glue for nails in case of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.010
 that do not want to apply a glaze 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.620
 transparent above but then I 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.360
 I chose to apply the transparent enamel 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.030
 above nothing else I assure myself well of 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.550
 apply it so there are no bubbles 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 and that's it, that's how they're going to 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.480
 achieve this nail art design 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.580
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640
 video and make this design 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.980
 using your favorite colors 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.930
 thank you very much take care of us and we 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.930
 we see for the next goodbye
