t-shirt it's from their selected section

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.790 
t-shirt it's from their selected section
try<00:04:26.150> saying<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.690> ten<00:04:26.930> times<00:04:27.080> fast<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.680> yeah

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
try saying that ten times fast and yeah

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.409
