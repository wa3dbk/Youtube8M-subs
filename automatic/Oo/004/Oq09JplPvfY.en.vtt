carrot ometer which gave us a limited

amount of information about the

patient's cornea but now we're able to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520

use<00:01:56.189> much<00:01:56.640> greater<00:01:56.939> information<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.869> find

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
use much greater information so we find

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
use much greater information so we find
that<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.770> much<00:01:58.920> better<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.700> trying

do<00:02:18.890> find<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.280> Scout<00:02:19.490> easier<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.120> use<00:02:20.390> because

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
do find the Scout easier to use because

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.800 
do find the Scout easier to use because
you<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.890> get<00:02:22.250> closer<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> eye<00:02:23.300> and

you can get closer to the eye and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.260 
you can get closer to the eye and
therefore<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.040> use<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.459> pretty<00:02:26.120> much

practice<00:03:53.450> since<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.049> slit<00:03:54.320> lamp<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.799> i<00:03:55.549> use

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
practice since the slit lamp and i use

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.930 
practice since the slit lamp and i use
it<00:03:56.030> routinely<00:03:56.709> without<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.739> doubt<00:03:58.010> every<00:03:58.760> time

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
it routinely without a doubt every time

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.670 
it routinely without a doubt every time
you<00:03:59.299> can<00:03:59.420> get<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.630> much<00:03:59.870> more<00:04:00.140> accurate<00:04:00.320> idea

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
you can get a much more accurate idea

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.580 
you can get a much more accurate idea
about<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.310> shape<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.790> cornea<00:04:02.380> giving<00:04:03.380> you

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
about the shape of the cornea giving you

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.620 
about the shape of the cornea giving you
a<00:04:03.620> far<00:04:04.220> more<00:04:04.459> accurate<00:04:04.700> countenance<00:04:05.420> fee

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
a far more accurate countenance fee

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.870 
a far more accurate countenance fee
which<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.350> long<00:04:06.530> term<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:07.040> save<00:04:07.310> chair

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
which in the long term to save chair

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.300 
which in the long term to save chair
time<00:04:08.120> which<00:04:08.510> as<00:04:08.810> we<00:04:09.320> all<00:04:09.350> know<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.799> our<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.220> our

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
time which as we all know is our is our

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.900 
time which as we all know is our is our
cost<00:04:10.700> oh<00:04:11.060> okay<00:04:11.570> without<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.989> typographer<00:04:12.829> is<00:04:13.640> an

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
cost oh okay without a typographer is an

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.860 
cost oh okay without a typographer is an
absolute<00:04:14.359> night

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
absolute night

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.439 
absolute night
for<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.680> patients<00:04:16.400> for<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.880> practice<00:04:17.299> you

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
for the patients for the practice you

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.530 
for the patients for the practice you
know<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:18.440> very<00:04:18.530> easy<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.220> use<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:20.329> carrot

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
know it's very easy to use the carrot

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.170 
know it's very easy to use the carrot
Ron<00:04:20.959> particularly<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.040> brilliant<00:04:22.550> it's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
Ron particularly is brilliant it's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.129 
Ron particularly is brilliant it's
interlinked<00:04:23.930> with<00:04:24.820> love<00:04:25.820> 7<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.780> the

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
interlinked with love 7 so it's the

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.320 
interlinked with love 7 so it's the
images<00:04:27.530> are<00:04:27.680> sent<00:04:27.889> down<00:04:28.400> directly<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.240> each

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
images are sent down directly and each

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.510 
images are sent down directly and each
time<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.780> patient<00:04:29.930> comes<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.590> we<00:04:31.130> can<00:04:31.340> monitor

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
time the patient comes in we can monitor

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520 
time the patient comes in we can monitor
if<00:04:31.940> there's<00:04:32.150> any<00:04:32.300> change<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.020> surface<00:04:33.169> of

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
if there's any change in the surface of

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.390 
if there's any change in the surface of
the<00:04:33.680> cornea<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:35.350> it's<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.949> a<00:04:37.160> great

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the cornea so it's just a great

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.810 
the cornea so it's just a great
instrument<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.300> wouldn't<00:04:38.600> be<00:04:38.690> without<00:04:38.810> it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.850 

Oh
