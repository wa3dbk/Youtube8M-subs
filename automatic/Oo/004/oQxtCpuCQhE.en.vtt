so<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> celiac<00:01:12.450> versus<00:01:12.900> what's<00:01:13.049> gluten

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
so with celiac versus what's gluten

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.399 
so with celiac versus what's gluten
sensitivity<00:01:14.119> people<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.270> celiac<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:16.170> an

immuno sensitive response that's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
immuno sensitive response that's
triggered<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.750> gluten<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:19.920> eat

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
triggered by gluten so when they eat

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
triggered by gluten so when they eat
gluten<00:01:20.460> their<00:01:20.610> immune<00:01:21.000> system<00:01:21.360> flares<00:01:21.600> up

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
gluten their immune system flares up

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.570 
gluten their immune system flares up
antibodies<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.799> wild<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.520> think

antibodies go wild because they think

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
antibodies go wild because they think
that<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> foreign<00:01:24.570> invader<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.110> their

that there's a foreign invader in their

that there's a foreign invader in their

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
body gluten sensitivity has similar

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
body gluten sensitivity has similar
symptoms<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.890> bloating<00:01:29.430> diarrhea<00:01:29.640> joint

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
symptoms of bloating diarrhea joint

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840 
symptoms of bloating diarrhea joint
pains<00:01:30.840> fatigue<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
pains fatigue but they just don't have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
pains fatigue but they just don't have
the<00:01:32.880> immune<00:01:33.450> response

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the immune response

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.999 
the immune response
what<00:01:35.159> exactly<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.880> gluten<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.630> body

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
what exactly does gluten do in your body

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
what exactly does gluten do in your body
so<00:01:38.009> gluten<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> protein<00:01:38.340> chain<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> all

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so gluten is a protein chain and all

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.940 
so gluten is a protein chain and all
protein<00:01:39.990> chains<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> different<00:01:40.590> structures

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
protein chains have different structures

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
protein chains have different structures
so<00:01:41.250> protein<00:01:41.700> chain<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.150> meat<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.899> gonna

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so protein chain for meat it's gonna

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
so protein chain for meat it's gonna
look<00:01:43.229> different<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.590> protein<00:01:43.950> chain<00:01:44.159> from

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
look different from protein chain from

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.520 
look different from protein chain from
greens<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.600> from<00:01:45.750> eggs<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.320> anything

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
greens or from eggs or from anything

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
greens or from eggs or from anything
like<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:47.939> eating<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
like that so when you're eating the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
like that so when you're eating the
structure<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.350> goes<00:01:49.770> into<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.189> stomach<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
structure it goes into your stomach and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
structure it goes into your stomach and
your<00:01:52.079> stomach<00:01:52.530> has<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> break<00:01:53.040> down<00:01:53.220> remember

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
your stomach has to break down remember

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
your stomach has to break down remember
a<00:01:53.729> protein<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> essential<00:01:54.869> amino<00:01:55.020> acids

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
a protein is the essential amino acids

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
a protein is the essential amino acids
with<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> bonds<00:01:56.159> connecting<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.719> your

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with the bonds connecting them so your

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
with the bonds connecting them so your
stomach<00:01:58.530> acid<00:01:58.829> breaks<00:01:59.520> down<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.149> bonds

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
stomach acid breaks down the bonds

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.539 
stomach acid breaks down the bonds
between<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> essential<00:02:01.829> amino<00:02:01.860> acids

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
between all of the essential amino acids

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
between all of the essential amino acids
so<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.570> body<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> digest<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.590> tinier

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
so your body can digest the tinier

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.870 
so your body can digest the tinier
pieces<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:06.110> vital<00:02:07.110> nutrients

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
pieces of vital nutrients

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.240 
pieces of vital nutrients
what<00:02:08.420> happens<00:02:08.690> with<00:02:08.780> gluten<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.709> those

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
what happens with gluten is that those

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.160 
what happens with gluten is that those
bonds<00:02:10.729> are<00:02:10.789> often<00:02:11.180> really<00:02:11.630> hard<00:02:11.900> for<00:02:12.050> your

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
bonds are often really hard for your

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.260 
bonds are often really hard for your
stomach<00:02:12.500> acid<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.890> digest<00:02:13.010> especially<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.120> you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
stomach acid to digest especially if you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.960 
stomach acid to digest especially if you
don't<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.380> specific<00:02:15.890> acid<00:02:16.280> enzyme<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't have the specific acid enzyme to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.960 
don't have the specific acid enzyme to
digest<00:02:17.000> gluten<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:19.430> means<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.849> entire

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
digest gluten so that means the entire

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.530 
digest gluten so that means the entire
chunk<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.620> whole<00:02:21.890> protein<00:02:22.670> would<00:02:22.970> go<00:02:23.239> into

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
chunk of the whole protein would go into

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.559 
chunk of the whole protein would go into
