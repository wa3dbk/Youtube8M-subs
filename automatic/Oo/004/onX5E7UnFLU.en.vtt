00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.800 

hi<00:00:00.599> I've<00:00:01.050> been<00:00:02.090> trying<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.120> figure<00:00:03.360> out<00:00:03.419> for

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hi I've been trying to figure out for

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.049 
hi I've been trying to figure out for
past<00:00:04.259> 20<00:00:04.620> years<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> mow<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:06.000> steep<00:00:06.720> hill

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
past 20 years how to mow this steep hill

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.200 
past 20 years how to mow this steep hill
without<00:00:09.059> killing<00:00:09.929> myself<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:11.090> part<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
without killing myself and part of the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.700 
without killing myself and part of the
solution<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.139> battery-powered

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
solution was to get this battery-powered

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.519 
solution was to get this battery-powered
self-propelled<00:00:14.610> lawnmower<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.420> even<00:00:16.320> even

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
self-propelled lawnmower but even even

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.550 
self-propelled lawnmower but even even
then<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.640> kept<00:00:17.850> sliding<00:00:18.180> off<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.690> hill<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
then it kept sliding off the hill and I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.230 
then it kept sliding off the hill and I
would<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> second<00:00:20.550> person<00:00:20.699> hold

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
would have to have a second person hold

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.120 
would have to have a second person hold
me<00:00:21.510> onto<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> hill<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> rope<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.830> hold<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
me onto the hill with a rope or hold the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.790 
me onto the hill with a rope or hold the
mower<00:00:23.310> onto<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> hill<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> rope<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
mower onto the hill with the rope I

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
mower onto the hill with the rope I
guided<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.099> back<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> forth<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.910> today<00:00:27.510> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
guided it back and forth and today I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
guided it back and forth and today I
think<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.019> finally<00:00:28.400> figured<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.090> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
think I finally figured out how to do it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.690 
think I finally figured out how to do it
without<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.660> rope<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> second<00:00:31.560> person<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
without the rope in the second person so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
without the rope in the second person so
come<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> I'll<00:00:34.290> show<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of sheet metal screws and I studied the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.410 
of sheet metal screws and I studied the
rear<00:00:56.910> wheels<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> put<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> screw<00:00:59.910> in<00:00:59.940> every

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
rear wheels so I put a screw in every

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.540 
rear wheels so I put a screw in every
six<00:01:00.690> inches<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> way

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
six inches or so going all the way
around<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.090> wheel<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:04.799> did<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> same

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
around the wheel I and did the same

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
around the wheel I and did the same
thing<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> other<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.350> front

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
thing on the other side on the front

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
thing on the other side on the front
wheels<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.890> didn't<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
wheels I didn't do it so that I can

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.289 
wheels I didn't do it so that I can
still<00:01:10.280> transport<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.580> pavement<00:01:12.150> by

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
still transport it on pavement by

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.719 
still transport it on pavement by
lifting<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> rear<00:01:13.200> wheels<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.549> just

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
lifting up the rear wheels and I just

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
lifting up the rear wheels and I just
scoot<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> along<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.650> just<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:16.860> roll

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
scoot it along like that just would roll

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.070 
scoot it along like that just would roll
very<00:01:17.340> well<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.850> pavement<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.600> any<00:01:18.780> grass

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
very well on pavement but on any grass

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.399 
very well on pavement but on any grass
they<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.100> sink<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> traction

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
they just sink right in and the traction

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
they just sink right in and the traction
is<00:01:22.470> incredible<00:01:23.930> it's<00:01:24.930> probably<00:01:25.229> helping

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is incredible it's probably helping

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
is incredible it's probably helping

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.570 

so<00:01:58.330> hey<00:01:58.960> I've<00:01:59.530> already<00:01:59.680> mowed<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.189> steepest

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
so hey I've already mowed the steepest

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.640 
so hey I've already mowed the steepest
part<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.060> pretend<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.540> legend<00:02:01.900> mode<00:02:02.080> yet<00:02:02.409> and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
part so pretend this legend mode yet and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.300 
part so pretend this legend mode yet and
I'll<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.729> oh<00:02:04.320> there's<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.409> skip<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.100> should

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
I'll do oh there's a skip there I should

00:02:06.310 --> 00:03:05.370 
I'll do oh there's a skip there I should
do<00:02:06.460> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.110 

when<00:03:06.380> they<00:03:06.500> need<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:06.830> go<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.100> pavement<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.670> reset

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
when they need to go on pavement I reset

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240 
when they need to go on pavement I reset
the<00:03:08.150> handle<00:03:09.050> angle<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:09.920> easy<00:03:10.100> to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
the handle angle so that it's easy to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.630 
the handle angle so that it's easy to
lift<00:03:10.490> up<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.910> rear<00:03:11.090> wheels<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.470> then<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.490> can

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
lift up the rear wheels and then I can

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.480 
lift up the rear wheels and then I can
just<00:03:14.680> travel<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> front<00:03:16.130> wheels<00:03:16.280> across

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
just travel on the front wheels across

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.300 
just travel on the front wheels across
the<00:03:16.850> pavement<00:03:18.460> dad<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.470> over<00:03:21.770> here<00:03:21.980> I'll<00:03:22.130> show

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
the pavement dad and over here I'll show

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.610 
the pavement dad and over here I'll show
you<00:03:22.370> how<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.640> put<00:03:22.850> these<00:03:23.120> studies<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:26.500> here<00:03:27.500> are

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
you how I put these studies in here are

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:38.130 
you how I put these studies in here are
the<00:03:28.870> sheet<00:03:29.870> metal<00:03:30.200> screws<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:36.010> here<00:03:37.010> we<00:03:37.130> go
