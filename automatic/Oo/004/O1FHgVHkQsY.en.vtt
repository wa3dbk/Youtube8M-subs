00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 Must see 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.859
 hi friends 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.230
 they are here again this is the same 19 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.809
 with 1 video and how can you see the title 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 of video this is going to be a very 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.570
 short of what is the supposed image 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.110
 of car word and ashley parameterization 4 and 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.400
 pipita that are called face world edition 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.670
 As everyone knows, it's just an image 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.040
 a photo that does not know if it's true or is 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.500
 false 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.250
 here I bring you some small mistakes 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.530
 that you notice in the image so that everything 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 it's fine in each tension here 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.150
 played in santa mica puig and 4x bitar 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.670
 but if we zoom in below we go with the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 letters we can notice two errors one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.530
 here says playstation and how do you know that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.780
 nor custom a playstation with the p 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.970
 capital letter and with the capital 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.460
 station and here it only shows that 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.920
 is the p with uppercase station is in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.770
 lowercase that's a mistake 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.170
 of the photo and others in another would be that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.180
 says make me free and commonly or it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 type make.believe make variable like this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.040
 write and there is another one could also 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.660
 be that that mistake of the developers 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.640
 of the image if it becomes 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.640
 true then an error like us 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.500
 as in new version revelations 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.370
 in field with he was wrong and he just put 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.700
 same reveal reveals use by making a 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.240
 developer error or it could 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.099
 be a clue to this is facebook 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.170
 they the only mistakes that do not have 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.980
 rather they know that that moment 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.989
 confirmed or nothing or if you play more 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.489
 comment bad down here and so mother 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:24.040
 annotated amazon of photography and they go to 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.650
 be all really well and as I said 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.750
 there are sections mistakes or things that 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 do have a certain factor here I commented 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.640
 I have it until next time
