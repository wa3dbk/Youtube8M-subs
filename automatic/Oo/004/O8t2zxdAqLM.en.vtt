that<00:00:49.350> nothing<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.640> faith<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that nothing I just have faith in the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
that nothing I just have faith in the
community<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.870> did<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> worked

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
community I really did then it worked

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.580 
community I really did then it worked
out<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> smashers<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.440> their

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
out I think a lot of smashers have their

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
out I think a lot of smashers have their
disagreements<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.510> tournaments<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
disagreements but really tournaments of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.349 
disagreements but really tournaments of
the<00:00:58.440> glue<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> hold<00:00:59.129> us<00:00:59.340> together<00:00:59.550> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the glue that hold us together the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.549 
the glue that hold us together the
biggest<00:01:00.539> difference<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> smashing<00:01:01.440> other

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
biggest difference is smashing other

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.100 
biggest difference is smashing other
games<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
games is that you have this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.869 
games is that you have this
to<00:01:03.290> be<00:01:03.470> there<00:01:03.710> at<00:01:03.920> least<00:01:04.070> for<00:01:04.190> melee<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.730> need

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
to be there at least for melee you need

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.160 
to be there at least for melee you need
to<00:01:05.000> be<00:01:05.150> next<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.540> someone<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:05.990> actually

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to be next to someone to actually

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.700 
to be next to someone to actually
compete<00:01:06.710> at<00:01:06.920> an<00:01:07.040> accurate<00:01:07.460> state<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.710> I'm

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
compete at an accurate state so I'm

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.990 
compete at an accurate state so I'm
pretty<00:01:09.980> sure<00:01:10.100> everyone<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.670> set<00:01:10.850> their

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
pretty sure everyone just set their

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000 
pretty sure everyone just set their
differences<00:01:11.180> aside<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.080> worked<00:01:12.650> really<00:01:12.890> hard

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
differences aside and worked really hard

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.590 
differences aside and worked really hard
to<00:01:13.310> make<00:01:13.460> sure<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:13.760> tournament<00:01:14.180> happen

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
to make sure this tournament happen

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.110 
to make sure this tournament happen
especially<00:01:15.470> knowing<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.980> people<00:01:16.640> came<00:01:16.880> from

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
especially knowing that people came from

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.870 
especially knowing that people came from
like<00:01:17.300> Sweden<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.140> Japan<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.920> Germany<00:01:19.100> there

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
like Sweden and Japan and Germany there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.670 
like Sweden and Japan and Germany there
is<00:01:19.910> no<00:01:20.210> way<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:20.690> were<00:01:20.750> really<00:01:21.110> about<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.560> let

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
is no way they were really about to let

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.100 
is no way they were really about to let
something<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.220> fall<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:23.780> gave<00:01:23.960> its
