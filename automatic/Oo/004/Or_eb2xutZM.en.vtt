00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.620
 Welcome to the great position 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:07.749
 in the field of electrical engineering, but before we go 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.150
 the great position in electrical engineering 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.030
 Let's take a look at the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.640
 conditions in mechanics that should 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.730
 Here be a train putting in 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.220
 movement starts here with the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.220
 speed vz in the specified 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.740
 direction and that's what happens so often 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.949
 happened passed on the platform 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.640
 someone from a person there 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.999
 sits in it waving a red one 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.839
 handkerchief full of sadness 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.600
 whether the upcoming separation the 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:48.449
 person in train she is quite moved 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 jump up and fall in that direction 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.960
 opposite to the direction of travel 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.639
 develops its own here 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.969
 speed comes from the times 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:03.339
 Male departing in this direction 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.369
 and what happens so long as the train 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.920
 not moving too fast yet 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.259
 This man actually related 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.869
 not on the platform at all 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.759
 forward therefore remains at this point 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.090
 but it comes as it must come 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.399
 Train is grabbing faster and faster now 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 but also the lady initiative 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.640
 is still developing in this direction 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.850
 here also a own one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 speed and behold, she creates 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.920
 for a while 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 speed difference too 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.179
 compensate and this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.289
 speed difference is in this 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.649
 direction courts too long delta v here 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.409
 does not get bigger or the distance first 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.899
 not so big will be the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.789
 compensated speed so to speak 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.439
 a residual speed remains 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.539
 they do not remove each other 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.540
 further apart but that works 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.240
 Of course, only good for a while 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.790
 Let's take a look at what happens 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.060
 here physically we look 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.880
 the amounts to make a sum 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.540
 bill of speeds 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.150
 it is enough to look at the amounts because 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:26.290
 the direction of the speeds 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:32.670
 yes yes by the arrow marks ours 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:38.500
 data v is therefore the same 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.130
 speed of the train minus the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.430
 speed of here 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.550
 Adorable male traveler 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.340
 that is our people yes and if so how 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.350
 said the lady still takes initiative 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.410
 and still in this direction then runs 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.140
 she also manages this delta woman 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.980
 she has to keep up with her 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.120
 although they both in the opposite 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 run opposite direction 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.380
 So make it the distance then 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 to grow up for a while 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.170
 to let 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.209
 with respect to the platform is that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.209
 from this result 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.420
 why do we have this equation now 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.230
 written down that has a simple one 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:44.980
 reason every single speed is 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:48.659
 to see and see that she is visible 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.659
 it is also measurable 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.189
 the result of this speed 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.349
 addition of these signs afflicted 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.169
 speed addition is first 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.530
 once writes in quotation marks 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:17.489
 nothing so what we mean but mine is none 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:17.489
 movement in relation to each other 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.160
 So the two people move away 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.849
 Not 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.509
 the considered size data v is 0 for 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.509
 a certain time 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:47.250
 yes that's the result that's one 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.540
 classic super position task we 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.670
 see a total of three 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.920
 speeds involved we see 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.350
 a result speed and the 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.510
 important information is this one 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.280
 Let's look at a second example 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:10.020
 also from the mechanics 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.440
 let's take a weight that we 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.550
 put on a base plate on a 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.890
 tabletop there happens the following 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:25.860
 We know that our weight is ours 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.770
 impression force generated in this direction 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.710
 and we also know that the table is not 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:37.280
 gives in if he is stable enough and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:43.760
 a counterforce generated here and ours 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:49.250
 amount consideration as just in the 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.250
 Contemplation with the two trains shows 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.240
 that our pressure - our against 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:06.370
 power is zero 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.610
 the result is very similar to 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.770
 the train contemplation 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.039
 the result is in quotes 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.550
 nothing so no resulting 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.550
 Move 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:45.530
 in relation to another so between 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:45.530
 wiped table and weight table 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.169
 yet it is not that we have this 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.819
 both forces could not prove 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:07:00.090
 then we'll put a piece here 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:03.979
 foam in between then yes 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.690
 known that this foam is here 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:10.110
 So the distance is compressed 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:13.129
 drops as soon as we have the weight on this 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:17.490
 flexible foam 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:21.229
 And if we film a pressure gauge there 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.819
 or a pressure gauge sensor 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:27.090
 then we can very well 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:30.389
 the resulting force between weight 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:38.129
 and table measuring these forces are so 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:40.349
 because they are measurable and we know that 

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:42.569
 that this force is the same from up here 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.759
 that I have to be from down here since no 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:50.509
 resulting force is present so 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.509
 here too, every single power is 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:59.699
 visibly observable and thus 

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:04.550
 of course also measurable 

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.550
 So to capture physically correct
