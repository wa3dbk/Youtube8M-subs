00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
there's no two ways about it but it's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540 
there's no two ways about it but it's
all<00:00:18.330> about<00:00:18.570> moderation<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.039> wouldn't<00:00:20.279> be

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
all about moderation and I wouldn't be

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
all about moderation and I wouldn't be
going<00:00:20.730> putting<00:00:21.330> big<00:00:21.630> chunks<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> laying<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
going putting big chunks of it laying it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.040 
going putting big chunks of it laying it
you<00:00:23.670> know<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:24.000> inch<00:00:24.180> thick<00:00:24.449> everywhere<00:00:24.930> I'll

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
you know an inch thick everywhere I'll

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.339 
you know an inch thick everywhere I'll
just<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.380> sprinkling<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> around<00:00:26.810> all<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.199> my

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
just be sprinkling it around all over my

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
just be sprinkling it around all over my
lawn<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.429> through<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> garden<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
lawn or all through the garden and it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.650 
lawn or all through the garden and it
will<00:00:31.410> eventually<00:00:31.740> seep<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> soil<00:00:32.759> wood

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
will eventually seep into the soil wood

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
will eventually seep into the soil wood
ash<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> also<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:34.860> clay<00:00:35.190> soils

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
ash is also really good for clay soils

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940 
ash is also really good for clay soils
it<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.239> gets<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> there<00:00:36.989> creates<00:00:37.710> air

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it actually gets in there creates air

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190 
it actually gets in there creates air
pockets<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> helps<00:00:39.270> break<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.780> soil

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pockets and helps break down the soil

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.310 
pockets and helps break down the soil
into<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:41.430> manageable<00:00:41.579> clumps<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> also

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
into more manageable clumps you can also

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
into more manageable clumps you can also
use<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:43.980> sprinkling<00:00:44.460> around<00:00:44.850> your

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
use it for sprinkling around your

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.540 
use it for sprinkling around your
vegetables<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.960> you've<00:00:46.200> got<00:00:46.440> grubs<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> slugs

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
vegetables if you've got grubs and slugs

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
vegetables if you've got grubs and slugs
and<00:00:47.820> snails<00:00:47.879> crawling<00:00:48.629> through<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.230> garden

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and snails crawling through your garden

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
and snails crawling through your garden
just<00:00:49.800> sprinkle<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.640> wood<00:00:50.969> ash<00:00:51.120> over<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just sprinkle some wood ash over and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
just sprinkle some wood ash over and
around<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.829> veggies<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.420> deter

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
around your veggies and it will deter

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
around your veggies and it will deter
those<00:00:54.989> snails<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.829> slugs<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.550> everything

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
those snails and slugs and everything

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
those snails and slugs and everything
they<00:00:57.420> hate<00:00:57.690> crawling<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> stuff<00:00:58.620> now

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
they hate crawling in the stuff now

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
they hate crawling in the stuff now
because<00:00:59.280> wood<00:00:59.699> ash<00:00:59.850> contains<00:01:00.270> about<00:01:00.570> 25

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
because wood ash contains about 25

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.439 
because wood ash contains about 25
percent<00:01:01.500> calcium<00:01:02.010> carbonate<00:01:02.520> which<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.120> key

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
percent calcium carbonate which is a key

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.770 
percent calcium carbonate which is a key
ingredient<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.320> lime<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.420> good<00:01:06.600> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
ingredient in lime it's really good for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
ingredient in lime it's really good for
acidic<00:01:07.200> soil<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.040> you've<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.310> acidic

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
acidic soil so if you've got acidic

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
acidic soil so if you've got acidic
soils<00:01:09.150> sprinkle<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.229> wood<00:01:10.470> ash<00:01:10.619> around<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
soils sprinkle some wood ash around and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
soils sprinkle some wood ash around and
it<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.180> help<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> balance<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.470> pH<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.159> your

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it will help the balance your pH in your

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420 
it will help the balance your pH in your
soil<00:01:14.580> sweeten<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.659> soil<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:17.220> things

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
soil sweeten that soil up and get things

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.270 
soil sweeten that soil up and get things
growing<00:01:17.790> again<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.380> downside<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> course

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
growing again on the downside of course

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
growing again on the downside of course
if<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:20.729> adding<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> already<00:01:21.960> alkaline

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
if you're adding it to already alkaline

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
if you're adding it to already alkaline
soil<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.700> stop<00:01:24.090> those<00:01:24.270> plants<00:01:24.810> bringing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
soil it can stop those plants bringing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
soil it can stop those plants bringing
the<00:01:25.650> nutrients<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.400> from<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> soil<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> can

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the nutrients in from the soil so it can

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
the nutrients in from the soil so it can
have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.500> adverse<00:01:29.040> effect<00:01:29.549> also<00:01:30.090> you've<00:01:30.479> got

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
have a an adverse effect also you've got

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
have a an adverse effect also you've got
to<00:01:30.720> remember<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.100> raise

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to remember that because it does raise
