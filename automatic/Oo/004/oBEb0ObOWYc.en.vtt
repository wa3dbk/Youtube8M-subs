using a certain certain space on the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.479 
using a certain certain space on the
vehicle<00:00:30.830> we're<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.950> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.400> by

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
vehicle we're just going to start by

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.260 
vehicle we're just going to start by
going<00:00:32.790> down<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.510> my<00:00:33.720> left<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> sure<00:00:36.090> what

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going down to my left but sure what

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.229 
going down to my left but sure what
angle<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.140> camera<00:00:37.739> view<00:00:38.239> I'm

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
angle it is from your camera view I'm

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.150 
angle it is from your camera view I'm
going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.480> make<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.840> loops<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> press<00:00:40.770> down

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.310 

back<00:00:44.160> into<00:00:44.400> it<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.900> to<00:00:48.989> swing

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
back into it and now I'm going to swing

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.790 
back into it and now I'm going to swing
my<00:00:49.530> direction<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.159> this<00:00:50.460> way<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
my direction down this way it's a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.240 
my direction down this way it's a
graceful<00:00:56.430> long<00:00:57.300> tail<00:00:57.860> I'm<00:00:58.860> going<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.100> take

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
graceful long tail I'm going to take

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
graceful long tail I'm going to take
some<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.550> same<00:00:59.879> color<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.510> double<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
some of that same color and double this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.420 
some of that same color and double this
line<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.519> maybe<00:01:06.770> close<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
line up and maybe close it off with a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.610 
line up and maybe close it off with a
little<00:01:08.670> tight<00:01:09.540> loop<00:01:09.870> like<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> want

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
little tight loop like so and now I want

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.750 
little tight loop like so and now I want
to<00:01:13.680> move<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.820> direction<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
to move it this direction here so if you

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.100 
to move it this direction here so if you
want<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.000> zoom<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.510> bit<00:01:20.899> able<00:01:21.899> to<00:01:21.960> do

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
want to zoom out a little bit able to do

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770 
want to zoom out a little bit able to do
that<00:01:23.119> okay<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that okay I'm going to take this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.149 
that okay I'm going to take this
direction<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.710> come<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:28.159> what

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
direction now and come out this way what

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.139 
direction now and come out this way what
I'm<00:01:29.280> thinking<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.969> on<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> motorcycle<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> car

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
I'm thinking is on a motorcycle or a car

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.109 
I'm thinking is on a motorcycle or a car
or<00:01:33.149> truck<00:01:33.560> where<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.920> door<00:01:35.579> handle<00:01:35.820> or

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
or truck where there's a door handle or

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
or truck where there's a door handle or
a<00:01:36.149> mirror<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.600> something<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:37.500> incumbrance

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
a mirror or something an incumbrance

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
a mirror or something an incumbrance
that<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.219> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.640> around<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that I have to work around I have to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859 
that I have to work around I have to
learn<00:01:40.259> how<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.469> bend<00:01:40.770> these<00:01:40.950> designs<00:01:41.719> so<00:01:42.719> we're

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
learn how to bend these designs so we're

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.270 
learn how to bend these designs so we're
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> come<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> design<00:01:44.039> now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
going to come out of this design now

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.709 
going to come out of this design now
make<00:01:44.789> our<00:01:44.939> starting<00:01:45.359> point<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:47.600> give<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
make our starting point here give it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.670 
make our starting point here give it
this<00:01:48.899> direction<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.479> take<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.899> loop

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.380 

these<00:01:55.680> loops<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.340> determine<00:01:56.970> where<00:01:57.210> your

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
these loops really determine where your

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.260 
these loops really determine where your
eye<00:01:58.250> follows<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> double<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.030> one

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
eye follows I'm going to double this one

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.550 
eye follows I'm going to double this one
up<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.960> I'm<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.649> other<00:02:04.920> end

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
up and I'm going to take this other end

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
up and I'm going to take this other end
pallet<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> darker<00:02:08.849> value

dress<00:04:09.270> this<00:04:09.420> design<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:10.080> let's<00:04:10.590> take<00:04:10.770> another

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
dress this design up let's take another

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.950 
dress this design up let's take another
color<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:12.570> put<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> little<00:04:13.170> dot<00:04:14.960> between

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
color and just put a little dot between

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.120 
color and just put a little dot between
each<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.260> these<00:04:17.270> gives<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:18.450> sort<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
each of these gives it sort of a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.300 
each of these gives it sort of a
finished<00:04:20.930> touch<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.950> learned<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.250> from

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
finished touch like I learned this from

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.780 
finished touch like I learned this from

Mike Lavallee I think I'm going to take

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.140 
Mike Lavallee I think I'm going to take
some<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.090> same<00:04:27.480> color<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.970> swing<00:04:29.970> these

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
some of that same color and swing these

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.040 
some of that same color and swing these

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
guys out go right through this part of

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.110 
guys out go right through this part of
the<00:04:34.140> design<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:35.330> can<00:04:36.330> see<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.660> color<00:04:36.900> is

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
the design you can see the color is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.120 
the design you can see the color is
everything<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.420> scroll<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.950> got<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:43.980> nice

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
everything in the scroll and got a nice

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.430 
everything in the scroll and got a nice
that<00:04:44.400> adds<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.320> I'd<00:04:46.320> be<00:04:46.590> careful<00:04:48.350> piling<00:04:49.350> it

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
that adds to it I'd be careful piling it

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.800 
that adds to it I'd be careful piling it
too<00:04:49.620> thick<00:04:49.920> but<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.460> can<00:04:50.610> even<00:04:50.730> take<00:04:51.090> through

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
too thick but you can even take through

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.800 
too thick but you can even take through
the<00:04:51.840> center<00:04:52.200> of<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> design<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:54.180> swing<00:04:54.660> an

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
the center of the design and swing an

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.780 
the center of the design and swing an
extra<00:04:56.570> occasional<00:04:57.800> one<00:04:58.800> go<00:04:58.950> cut<00:04:59.580> through

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
extra occasional one go cut through

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.390 
extra occasional one go cut through
there<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.090> too<00:05:00.240> tight<00:05:00.680> swing<00:05:01.680> an<00:05:01.800> occasional

there it's too tight swing an occasional
