00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
will be the first episode we have the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.330 
will be the first episode we have the
dwc<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.090> deep<00:00:21.359> water<00:00:22.199> culture<00:00:22.650> buckets

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
dwc the deep water culture buckets

dwc the deep water culture buckets
sitting<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> back<00:00:24.289> let's<00:00:25.289> take<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.800> at

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
sitting in the back let's take a look at

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.380 
sitting in the back let's take a look at
those<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.000> much<00:00:27.119> they've<00:00:27.359> changed

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
those and see how much they've changed

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
those and see how much they've changed
since<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> last<00:00:28.320> time<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.800> took<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> look<00:00:29.130> at

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
since the last time we took a look at

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.450 
since the last time we took a look at
them<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.670> things<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:31.170> grown<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
them now things here have grown just a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.819 
them now things here have grown just a
little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:33.890> I've<00:00:34.890> made<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.670> small<00:00:35.760> change

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
little bit I've made a small change

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
little bit I've made a small change
sitting<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.050> actually

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sitting in the back here I actually

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.100 
sitting in the back here I actually
found<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.649> actual<00:00:40.800> manifold<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.110> airline

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
found an actual manifold for airline

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.220 
found an actual manifold for airline
hoses<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> picked<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.230> local

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
hoses this one I picked up at the local

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
hoses this one I picked up at the local
pet<00:00:46.800> shop<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.789> around<00:00:47.940> five<00:00:48.300> dollars

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
pet shop for just around five dollars

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.500 
pet shop for just around five dollars
and<00:00:49.010> although<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:51.000> before<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and although what I had before is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
and although what I had before is
basically<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> same<00:00:52.620> idea<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.180> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
basically the same idea this one is just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
basically the same idea this one is just
a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.230> easier<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> manage<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a lot more easier to manage and I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.970 
a lot more easier to manage and I
thought<00:00:56.460> it'd<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> nice<00:00:57.360> touch<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
thought it'd just be a nice touch the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.880 
thought it'd just be a nice touch the
plants<00:00:59.850> themselves<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.840> growing<00:01:01.140> too<00:01:01.559> big

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
plants themselves not growing too big

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.299 
plants themselves not growing too big
yet<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.439> small<00:01:04.979> little

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
yet I don't know if the small little

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.880 
yet I don't know if the small little
pump<00:01:05.549> I'm<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.840> deliver<00:01:07.380> air<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.740> these

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
pump I'm using to deliver air to these

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.060 
pump I'm using to deliver air to these
maybe<00:01:08.340> isn't<00:01:08.760> enough<00:01:09.090> air<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> lot

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
maybe isn't enough air I know it's a lot

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
maybe isn't enough air I know it's a lot
colder<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.000> inside<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> flood<00:01:13.110> table

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
colder here than inside the flood table

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.789 
colder here than inside the flood table
we<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.950> built<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:15.020> things<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.290> growing<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
we have built there things are growing a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
we have built there things are growing a
bit<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.189> take<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> roots

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
bit if we take take a look at the roots

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.100 
bit if we take take a look at the roots
here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 

so<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.130> plant<00:01:26.460> probably<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.750> most

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so this one plant probably has the most

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
so this one plant probably has the most
root<00:01:28.560> growth<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:34.410> it's<00:01:35.130> not

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
root growth out of them all and it's not

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
root growth out of them all and it's not
to<00:01:35.550> be<00:01:35.940> fjord<00:01:36.510> leafy<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> growing<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to be fjord leafy but it is growing so I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
to be fjord leafy but it is growing so I
guess<00:01:40.110> we'll<00:01:40.260> just<00:01:40.290> keep<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.740> watching<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
guess we'll just keep on watching it to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.220 
guess we'll just keep on watching it to
see<00:01:41.580> how<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.060> does<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.900> other<00:01:42.960> ones

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
see how well it does the other ones

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.870 
see how well it does the other ones
don't<00:01:43.710> look<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.190> good<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:44.700> one

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
don't look quite as good as this one

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
don't look quite as good as this one
even<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.870> root<00:01:46.050> mass<00:01:46.260> isn't<00:01:46.950> as

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
even and the root mass isn't as

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.150 
even and the root mass isn't as
developed<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.760> guy<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.900> that's<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
developed as this guy but that's the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.460 
developed as this guy but that's the
deep<00:01:50.340> water<00:01:50.580> culture<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.330> let's<00:01:51.990> take<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.230> look

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
deep water culture and let's take a look

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.030 
deep water culture and let's take a look
at<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> stuff<00:01:52.890> inside<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> flood<00:01:53.610> table

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.530 

inside<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> flood<00:01:59.430> table<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.180> different

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
inside the flood table it's a different

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
inside the flood table it's a different
story<00:02:00.720> things<00:02:01.200> are<00:02:01.410> growing<00:02:01.590> nice<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.370> big

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
story things are growing nice and big

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630 
story things are growing nice and big
green<00:02:02.910> they<00:02:03.780> seem<00:02:04.050> really<00:02:04.320> happy<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.430> been

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.050 
the tomato plant have noticed that the
leaves<00:02:14.190> are<00:02:14.459> starting<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.060> curl<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
leaves are starting to curl up and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.640 
leaves are starting to curl up and
they're<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.300> dry<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.959> dead<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
they're a bit dry and dead on the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.150 
they're a bit dry and dead on the
outsides<00:02:21.170> underneath<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> leaves<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.890> almost

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
outsides underneath the leaves it almost

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.890 
outsides underneath the leaves it almost
looks<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.520> there's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.240> fungus<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.870> something

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
looks like there's a fungus or something

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.860 
looks like there's a fungus or something
growing<00:02:25.440> under<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.209> originally<00:02:27.780> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
growing under them and so originally I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
growing under them and so originally I
was<00:02:27.990> kind<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.290> concerned<00:02:28.680> because<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> thought

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
was kind of concerned because I thought

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.030 
was kind of concerned because I thought
hey<00:02:29.550> maybe<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.030> could<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.290> blight<00:02:31.290> tomato

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
hey maybe that could be blight tomato

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
hey maybe that could be blight tomato
blight<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.940> mean<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.200> unlikely

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
blight but I mean that's really unlikely

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.949 
blight but I mean that's really unlikely
considering<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.489> raised<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.880> guy<00:02:36.060> from<00:02:36.390> seed

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
considering I raised this guy from seed

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.890 
considering I raised this guy from seed
and<00:02:37.940> really<00:02:38.940> shouldn't<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.300> been<00:02:39.540> exposed

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and really shouldn't have been exposed

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.710 
and really shouldn't have been exposed
to<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.380> fungus<00:02:41.160> at<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
to that fungus at all but kind of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.910 
to that fungus at all but kind of
wondering<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:43.530> guys<00:02:43.709> thoughts<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:44.370> on

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
wondering what your guys thoughts are on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.060 
wondering what your guys thoughts are on
this<00:02:46.920> thing<00:02:47.989> start<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.080> an<00:02:49.200> opposite<00:02:49.680> problem

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this thing start up an opposite problem

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.210 
this thing start up an opposite problem
to<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.580> tomato<00:02:51.060> leaves<00:02:51.480> curling<00:02:52.080> over<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to the tomato leaves curling over is the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.790 
to the tomato leaves curling over is the
jalapeno<00:02:53.610> leaves<00:02:53.970> curling<00:02:54.480> under<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.080> I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
jalapeno leaves curling under and I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.710 
jalapeno leaves curling under and I
heard<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.489> could<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> sign<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> too

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
heard that this could be a sign of too

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.300 
heard that this could be a sign of too
much<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.110> something<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.860> only<00:02:59.010> thing<00:02:59.220> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
much of something and the only thing I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
much of something and the only thing I
could<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.670> think<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.300> too<00:03:00.570> much<00:03:00.750> water

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
could really think of was too much water

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.460 
could really think of was too much water
so<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> went<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.610> actually<00:03:02.760> cut<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:04.230> water

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
so I went and I actually cut the water

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.850 
so I went and I actually cut the water
cycles<00:03:05.100> for<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.880> day<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.390> half<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.200> half<00:03:07.680> as

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
cycles for the day in half so half as

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.620 
cycles for the day in half so half as
much<00:03:08.010> water<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.580> that's<00:03:08.700> been<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.269> for

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
much water and that's been going on for

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.600 
much water and that's been going on for
over<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.230> week<00:03:10.440> now<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.160> plants<00:03:11.489> don't

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
over a week now and the plants don't

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.990 
over a week now and the plants don't
seem<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.970> mind<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.739> still<00:03:14.280> curious<00:03:14.580> as<00:03:14.940> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
seem to mind but still curious as to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
seem to mind but still curious as to
what<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> could<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.380> should<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.800> least<00:03:16.920> be

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
what that could be should at least be

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
what that could be should at least be
going<00:03:17.489> back<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:18.150> will<00:03:18.480> they<00:03:18.600> stay<00:03:18.840> curled<00:03:19.230> like

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
going back or will they stay curled like

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.240 
going back or will they stay curled like
that<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.920> don't<00:03:20.400> know<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.320> General's<00:03:22.830> rule<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that I don't know so General's rule of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.729 
that I don't know so General's rule of
thumb<00:03:23.459> I've<00:03:23.670> heard<00:03:23.910> leaves<00:03:24.630> curling<00:03:25.140> up<00:03:25.320> look

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
thumb I've heard leaves curling up look

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.560 
thumb I've heard leaves curling up look
for<00:03:25.920> something<00:03:26.250> under<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.640> leaf<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.120> fungus

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
for something under the leaf like fungus

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.770 
for something under the leaf like fungus
parasites<00:03:28.250> leaves<00:03:29.250> curling<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:29.820> probably

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
parasites leaves curling down probably

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.210 
parasites leaves curling down probably
too<00:03:30.959> much<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.320> something<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.860> that's<00:03:31.950> all<00:03:32.190> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
too much of something and that's all I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.309 
too much of something and that's all I
really<00:03:32.519> know<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:32.820> now<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.510> can't<00:03:34.170> really

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
really know right now I can't really

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.330 
really know right now I can't really
pinpoint<00:03:34.620> what<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.640> for<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.910> tomato

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
pinpoint what it is for the tomato

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.070 
pinpoint what it is for the tomato
plant<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.849> don't<00:03:37.120> think<00:03:37.360> it's<00:03:37.480> burning<00:03:37.900> out<00:03:38.019> I

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
plant I don't think it's burning out I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.630 
plant I don't think it's burning out I
have<00:03:38.620> my<00:03:38.830> parts-per-million

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
have my parts-per-million

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.000 
have my parts-per-million
just<00:03:40.450> over<00:03:40.810> 800<00:03:41.190> parts<00:03:42.190> per<00:03:42.220> million<00:03:42.519> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
just over 800 parts per million of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.830 
just over 800 parts per million of
nutrient<00:03:45.010> mix<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.849> don't<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.450> that's<00:03:46.660> too

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
nutrient mix so I don't think that's too

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.540 
nutrient mix so I don't think that's too
hot<00:03:47.050> but<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.379> could<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.680> wrong<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.310> pepper

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
hot but it could be wrong the pepper

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.339 
hot but it could be wrong the pepper
plants<00:03:48.970> seem<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.269> be<00:03:49.390> doing<00:03:49.690> alright<00:03:49.870> there's

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
plants seem to be doing alright there's

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.660 
plants seem to be doing alright there's
just<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.620> few<00:03:50.860> of<00:03:50.950> them<00:03:51.129> that<00:03:51.160> have<00:03:51.310> those

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
just a few of them that have those

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.300 
just a few of them that have those
leaves<00:03:51.940> curling<00:03:52.569> under<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:53.860> that's<00:03:54.069> pretty

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
leaves curling under so that's pretty

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.890 
leaves curling under so that's pretty
much<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.519> for<00:03:54.819> this<00:03:54.940> one<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.540> wanted<00:03:55.750> to
