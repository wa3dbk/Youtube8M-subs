that<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> D<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.550> then<00:02:02.550> here's<00:02:02.880> D<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> two

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that is D and then here's D and two

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.290 
that is D and then here's D and two
frets<00:02:03.869> away<00:02:04.080> from<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.800> e<00:02:05.039> if<00:02:05.789> you<00:02:05.820> noticed

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
frets away from that is e if you noticed

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.469 
frets away from that is e if you noticed
we've<00:02:06.479> skipped<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.550> frets<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.820> those<00:02:09.300> are

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
we've skipped some frets and those are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.550 
we've skipped some frets and those are
the<00:02:09.539> black<00:02:09.720> keys<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> piano

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the black keys on the piano

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
the black keys on the piano
let's<00:02:10.770> call<00:02:11.009> sharps<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> flats<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.180> let's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
let's call sharps and flats so let's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.120 
let's call sharps and flats so let's
talk<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.050> second<00:02:13.350> sharps

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
talk about that for a second sharps

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.460 
talk about that for a second sharps
raise<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.360> note<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:16.380> fret<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.430> us<00:02:18.140> flat<00:02:19.140> does

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
raise a note one fret for us flat does

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
raise a note one fret for us flat does
the<00:02:19.590> opposite<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> lowers<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> note<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:20.790> fret

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the opposite it lowers a note one fret

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
the opposite it lowers a note one fret
so<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> raising<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.769> way<00:02:22.950> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
so this is raising going this way this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.050 
so this is raising going this way this
is<00:02:23.910> flat<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.400> lowering<00:02:26.670> is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
is flat right going back in lowering is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.430 
is flat right going back in lowering is
flat<00:02:27.330> right<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:28.950> E<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.360> F<00:02:30.630> we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
flat right so we have E we have F we

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.070 
flat right so we have E we have F we
have<00:02:31.680> G<00:02:32.130> right<00:02:32.910> we've<00:02:33.060> talked<00:02:33.299> about<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.780> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
have G right we've talked about that in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.880 
have G right we've talked about that in
between<00:02:34.620> F<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.280> G<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.930> f-sharp<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.920> g-flat

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
between F and G is f-sharp or g-flat

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.420 
between F and G is f-sharp or g-flat
same<00:02:40.890> exact<00:02:41.310> note<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.690> here's<00:02:43.230> E<00:02:43.560> here's

flat so now you know the rules right

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.339 
flat so now you know the rules right
between<00:03:46.859> every<00:03:47.400> letter<00:03:47.609> two<00:03:48.269> frets<00:03:48.599> except<00:03:49.079> B

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
between every letter two frets except B

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
and C and enf and then between those you

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.949 
and C and enf and then between those you
know<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> there<00:03:53.459> are<00:03:53.609> sharps<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.420> flats<00:03:54.510> you

know that there are sharps and flats you

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.990 
know that there are sharps and flats you
can<00:03:55.440> use<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:56.010> find<00:03:56.160> any<00:03:56.459> note<00:03:56.579> on<00:03:56.879> the

can use that to find any note on the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.089 
can use that to find any note on the
guitar<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.569> long<00:03:58.019> as<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.319> know<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.709> starting

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
guitar as long as you know the starting

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.909 
guitar as long as you know the starting
point<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.549> every<00:04:00.329> string<00:04:00.569> so<00:04:00.810> let's<00:04:00.989> say<00:04:01.620> we're

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
point of every string so let's say we're

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.280 
point of every string so let's say we're
going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.549> find<00:04:02.819> all<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.359> notes<00:04:03.540> on<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.720> g

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
going to find all the notes on the g

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.259 
going to find all the notes on the g
string<00:04:04.319> right<00:04:04.889> so<00:04:05.129> here<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.489> are<00:04:05.519> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.030> g

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
string right so here we are on the g
