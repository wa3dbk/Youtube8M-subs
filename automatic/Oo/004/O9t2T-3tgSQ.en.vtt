before<00:00:01.589> we<00:00:01.680> go<00:00:01.800> any<00:00:01.979> further<00:00:02.100> talking<00:00:02.669> about

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
before we go any further talking about

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.240 
before we go any further talking about
how<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.210> mix<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.659> clay<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.200> use<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.589> pottery<00:00:04.980> I

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
how to mix a clay to use in pottery I

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.240 
how to mix a clay to use in pottery I
want<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:05.970> about<00:00:06.270> safety<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.740> relates

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
want to talk about safety as it relates

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.400 
want to talk about safety as it relates
to<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.610> process<00:00:08.970> now<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> biggest<00:00:10.139> health

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
to that process now the biggest health

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070 
to that process now the biggest health

hazard in any ceramic studio environment

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.870 
hazard in any ceramic studio environment
is<00:00:13.259> dust<00:00:13.880> clay<00:00:14.880> materials<00:00:15.599> are<00:00:15.900> basically

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
is dust clay materials are basically

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.109 
is dust clay materials are basically
dust<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.869> everywhere<00:00:19.520> when<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.939> wet

form and it's bound up with water it's
not<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> problem<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> dries<00:00:26.880> out

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

or just walking around breathing that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
or just walking around breathing that
dust<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.430> seriously<00:00:35.850> damage<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.600> lungs

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
dust can seriously damage your lungs

dust can seriously damage your lungs
over<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:39.059> we're<00:00:39.210> mixing<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.719> clay

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
over time now when we're mixing the clay

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
over time now when we're mixing the clay
this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.230> even<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.770> important<00:00:41.309> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this is even more important because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
this is even more important because
we're<00:00:41.940> dealing<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.809> raw<00:00:42.989> powdered

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we're dealing with the raw powdered

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.190 
we're dealing with the raw powdered
materials<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.180> materials<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
materials some of these materials are so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
materials some of these materials are so
finely<00:00:46.620> powdered<00:00:47.070> they're<00:00:47.760> roughly<00:00:48.360> three

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
finely powdered they're roughly three

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
finely powdered they're roughly three
micron<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.160> third<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> micron<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.300> size

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
micron know a third of a micron in size

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
micron know a third of a micron in size
now<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.829> small<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> can't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
now that's so small that you can't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
now that's so small that you can't
possibly<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.710> small<00:00:55.949> enough

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
possibly see it and it's small enough

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
possibly see it and it's small enough
that<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.870> closed<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.949> room

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that if it were to be closed in a room

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
that if it were to be closed in a room
with<00:00:59.579> no<00:00:59.760> air<00:01:00.000> currents<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> could

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
with no air currents it could

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
with no air currents it could
potentially<00:01:00.899> stay<00:01:01.530> airborne<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
potentially stay airborne for up to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
potentially stay airborne for up to
three<00:01:02.940> days<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.570> means<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.619> all

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
three days which means that it's all

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
three days which means that it's all
around<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.119> breathing<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
around you and as you're breathing that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
around you and as you're breathing that
material<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.890> become<00:01:08.220> embedded<00:01:08.549> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
material in it can become embedded in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.670 
material in it can become embedded in
your<00:01:08.909> lungs<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> long<00:01:10.229> period<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
your lungs and over a long period of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190 
your lungs and over a long period of
time<00:01:10.740> cause<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> degenerative<00:01:12.600> disease<00:01:12.659> called

time cause a degenerative disease called
silicosis<00:01:13.760> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> roughly<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.869> getting

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
silicosis which is roughly like getting

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
silicosis which is roughly like getting
emphysema<00:01:16.530> builds<00:01:17.369> scar<00:01:17.640> tissue<00:01:17.880> inside<00:01:18.330> your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
emphysema builds scar tissue inside your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
emphysema builds scar tissue inside your
lungs<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.320> never<00:01:19.560> goes<00:01:19.830> away<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
lungs that never goes away so it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.030 
lungs that never goes away so it's
really<00:01:20.700> important<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.650> conscious<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> how

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
really important to be conscious of how

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
really important to be conscious of how
much<00:01:23.220> dust<00:01:23.549> you're<00:01:23.729> creating<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:25.020> much

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
much dust you're creating and how much

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.450 
much dust you're creating and how much
dust<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.590> breathing<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.310> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
dust you're breathing in and we can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
dust you're breathing in and we can
minimize<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
minimize that with the use of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
minimize that with the use of
respirators<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:29.520> there's<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.150> different

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
respirators now there's two different

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
respirators now there's two different
kinds<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> respirators<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.689> big

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
kinds of respirators this is the the big

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.490 
kinds of respirators this is the the big
boy<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.090> full<00:01:36.090> rubber<00:01:36.689> face<00:01:37.140> mask

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
boy here this is a full rubber face mask

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.819 
boy here this is a full rubber face mask
respirator<00:01:38.180> with<00:01:40.159> chemical<00:01:41.159> cartridges<00:01:42.829> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
respirator with chemical cartridges to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.289 
respirator with chemical cartridges to
filter<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.850> designed<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
filter this one these are designed to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
filter this one these are designed to
filter<00:01:45.570> organic<00:01:46.170> vapours<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
filter organic vapours so there they

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
filter organic vapours so there they
will<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.390> fine<00:01:48.659> particles<00:01:49.290> from

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
will take out really fine particles from

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
will take out really fine particles from
the<00:01:49.979> air<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.430> prevent<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.939> from<00:01:50.970> entering

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the air and prevent them from entering

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.780 
the air and prevent them from entering
your<00:01:51.420> lungs<00:01:51.799> they're<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.159> heavy<00:01:53.520> a
