you're BCM once you remove all your rom
plugs<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.329> there<00:02:46.510> you're<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.140> take<00:02:47.290> your

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
plugs on there you're going to take your

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.960 
plugs on there you're going to take your
long<00:02:47.650> Phillips<00:02:48.069> head<00:02:48.220> screwdriver<00:02:48.730> and

long Phillips head screwdriver and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.600 
long Phillips head screwdriver and
there's<00:02:49.209> going<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.930> looks<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.230> one

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
there's going to be it looks like one

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.589 
there's going to be it looks like one
two<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.829> probably<00:02:54.030> actually<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.239> think<00:02:55.450> those

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
two and probably actually I think those

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.640 
two and probably actually I think those
are<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.750> only<00:02:55.840> two<00:02:56.310> let's<00:02:57.310> find<00:02:57.549> out<00:02:57.730> but

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
are the only two let's find out but

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.030 
are the only two let's find out but
while<00:02:59.650> we're<00:02:59.799> at<00:02:59.890> it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
I think price is the only one that does

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.590 
I think price is the only one that does
it<00:04:09.900> but<00:04:10.900> when<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.680> them<00:04:11.770> up<00:04:12.420> some<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.510> them

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
it but when you get them up some of them

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.060 
it but when you get them up some of them
will<00:04:13.720> come<00:04:13.810> up<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.110> their<00:04:14.230> own<00:04:14.350> actually<00:04:14.920> it's
