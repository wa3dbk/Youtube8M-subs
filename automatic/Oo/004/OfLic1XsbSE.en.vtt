screwdriver<00:00:17.090> this<00:00:18.090> process<00:00:18.600> can<00:00:18.810> also<00:00:18.900> be

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
screwdriver this process can also be

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.279 
screwdriver this process can also be
used<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:19.650> most<00:00:19.800> scrammed<00:00:20.100> Arella<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> way<00:00:22.260> I

used for most scrammed Arella the way I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.380 
used for most scrammed Arella the way I
figured<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.010> how<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> adjust<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.060> cable

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
figured out how to adjust a cable

figured out how to adjust a cable
tension<00:00:24.720> lets<00:00:25.140> figuring<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> worked

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
tension lets figuring out how it worked

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
tension lets figuring out how it worked
you<00:00:27.210> twist<00:00:27.539> left<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.980> tightens<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
you twist left and it tightens the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.389 
you twist left and it tightens the
housing<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.779> twist<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.830> loosens<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
housing you twist right that loosens the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
housing you twist right that loosens the
housing<00:00:32.820> therefore<00:00:33.750> causing<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> derailleur

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
housing therefore causing the derailleur

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.850 
housing therefore causing the derailleur
to<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.690> trim<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> Shimano

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
to go up and down and trim and Shimano

XT<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.399> derailers<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> control

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
XT are derailers is all in the control

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
XT are derailers is all in the control
because<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> knob<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
because they do not have a knob on the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.840 
because they do not have a knob on the
driver<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.540> adjustment<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> limit<00:00:44.610> screws

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
driver for adjustment the limit screws
worked<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.510> way<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.469> rest<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
worked the same way as the rest of the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.560 
worked the same way as the rest of the
derailers<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.730> SRAM<00:00:48.210> inch<00:00:48.420> mono<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
derailers on SRAM inch mono this is a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
derailers on SRAM inch mono this is a
Shimano<00:00:51.840> extra<00:00:52.379> rather<00:00:52.739> than<00:00:53.010> no<00:00:53.160> cable

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Shimano extra rather than no cable

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:10.140 
Shimano extra rather than no cable
tension<00:00:53.910> restrictive

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.180 

it<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.840> supposed<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.230> be<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.440> first<00:01:11.620> unit<00:01:12.040> right

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
it is supposed to be in first unit right

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.830 
it is supposed to be in first unit right
now<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.070> how<00:01:15.160> their<00:01:15.340> adjustment<00:01:18.390> okay<00:01:19.390> so

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
now this is how their adjustment okay so

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.490 
now this is how their adjustment okay so
I'm<00:01:19.930> trying<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.290> shift<00:01:20.500> up<00:01:20.740> from<00:01:21.040> ten<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.490> nine

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I'm trying to shift up from ten to nine

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.370 
I'm trying to shift up from ten to nine
it<00:01:23.500> won't<00:01:23.710> go<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:24.910> let's<00:01:25.510> turn<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.960> cable

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
it won't go so let's turn to the cable

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
it won't go so let's turn to the cable
tension<00:01:26.590> what's<00:01:27.550> going<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.860> shifter

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.950 

and<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:36.750> eventually<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:38.480> now<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.690> do<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and it should eventually go now I do the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:51.899 
and it should eventually go now I do the
next<00:01:40.110> year<00:01:41.000> next<00:01:42.000> year<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.620> my<00:01:43.770> shirt

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.120 

now<00:01:52.420> there's<00:01:52.750> too<00:01:52.869> much<00:01:53.020> cable<00:01:53.380> tension<00:01:53.710> so

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
now there's too much cable tension so

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.820 
now there's too much cable tension so
we'll<00:01:54.310> go<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.439> loosen<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.470> cable

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
we'll go down and loosen the cable

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.410 
we'll go down and loosen the cable
tension

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.389 

and<00:02:03.960> goes<00:02:04.140> down

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.969 

when<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.209> five<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.810> balance<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.890> if

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
when you have five right balance see if

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:25.870 
when you have five right balance see if
it<00:02:11.069> will<00:02:11.129> come<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.489> up

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.330 

that's<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.959> pretty<00:02:28.230> simple<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that's all do it it's pretty simple but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.949 
that's all do it it's pretty simple but
don't<00:02:29.520> limit<00:02:29.610> schools<00:02:29.940> are<00:02:30.060> working<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
don't limit schools are working you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.840 
don't limit schools are working you
simply<00:02:31.260> take<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> cross<00:02:31.770> head<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.580> twist

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
simply take the cross head and you twist

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.559 
simply take the cross head and you twist
them<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> last<00:02:34.920> video<00:02:35.569> another

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
them like in the last video another

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.360 
them like in the last video another
cause<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:36.900> shifting<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.740> working<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.160> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
cause for shifting not working right is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.790 
cause for shifting not working right is
Lube<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.780> lube<00:02:39.990> your<00:02:40.140> chain<00:02:40.440> until

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
Lube you have to lube your chain until

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.490 
Lube you have to lube your chain until
it<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.430> grey<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> rag

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
it is grey on the rag

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.900 
it is grey on the rag
that's<00:02:43.500> all<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:44.640> much<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
that's all to it it's pretty much the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
that's all to it it's pretty much the
same<00:02:45.090> exact<00:02:45.420> thing<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:46.020> any<00:02:46.260> other<00:02:46.470> derailleur
