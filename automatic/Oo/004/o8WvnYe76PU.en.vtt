00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
writer from it if you ride always the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.360 
writer from it if you ride always the
easy<00:02:33.870> ones<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.380> never<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.709> anything<00:02:34.769> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
easy ones will never know anything and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
easy ones will never know anything and
frankly<00:02:35.910> that's<00:02:36.150> boring<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.660> wants<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.049> do

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
frankly that's boring it wants to do

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.550 
frankly that's boring it wants to do
that<00:02:42.440> bit<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> challenge<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.129> bring<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.610> hi

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
that bit of challenge so bring it on hi

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.539 
that bit of challenge so bring it on hi
so<00:02:46.560> yeah<00:02:46.709> when<00:02:46.889> you've<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> horse<00:02:47.340> with

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
so yeah when you've got a horse with

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.879 
so yeah when you've got a horse with
challenging<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.660> know<00:02:48.780> okay<00:02:49.170> when<00:02:49.590> one

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
challenging so you know okay when one

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.190 
challenging so you know okay when one
horse<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.340> care<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.910> deal<00:02:51.239> young<00:02:51.780> horse<00:02:52.049> I'm

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
horse I can care to deal young horse I'm

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.940 
horse I can care to deal young horse I'm
bouncing

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
bouncing

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.590 
bouncing
so<00:02:53.220> obviously<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.880> horse<00:02:54.120> might<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.569> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
so obviously that horse might have a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.949 
so obviously that horse might have a
bigger<00:02:55.590> moment<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:57.510> it'd<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
bigger moment of I think it'd be a

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.420 
bigger moment of I think it'd be a
moment<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.380> suspension<00:02:58.739> would<00:02:59.010> probably<00:02:59.280> suck

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
moment of suspension would probably suck

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.099 
moment of suspension would probably suck
you<00:02:59.579> anymore<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.569> doing<00:03:00.840> something

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
you anymore but it's doing something

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.930 
you anymore but it's doing something
with<00:03:01.440> its<00:03:01.590> legs<00:03:01.859> or<00:03:02.130> something<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.579> its<00:03:02.730> back

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
with its legs or something with its back

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.390 
with its legs or something with its back
that's<00:03:03.269> causing<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.840> bit<00:03:03.989> more<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.500> which<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
that's causing a bit more of it which is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.809 
that's causing a bit more of it which is
causing<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.970> go<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.220> need<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.430> do

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
causing you to go so all you need to do

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.210 
causing you to go so all you need to do
is<00:03:09.239> counteract<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.380> force<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:11.099> your

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
is counteract that force with your

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
being thrown at it at exactly the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.240 
being thrown at it at exactly the
measure<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.970> has<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.750> might<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.620> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
measure it has to so I might have to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.900 
measure it has to so I might have to
really<00:03:49.209> do<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:50.380> if<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:51.040> horse<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.550> doing

that but all you'll see is made of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.630 
that but all you'll see is made of
nothing<00:03:55.380> okay<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.620> minute<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.100> person<00:03:57.130> can

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
nothing okay the minute a person can

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.710 
nothing okay the minute a person can
