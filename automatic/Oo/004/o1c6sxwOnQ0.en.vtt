make<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.810> doesn't<00:01:49.049> use<00:01:49.140> too<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.500> fuel

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
make sure he doesn't use too much fuel

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.319 
make sure he doesn't use too much fuel
because<00:01:50.399> these<00:01:50.520> things<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.909> burn<00:01:51.090> through<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
because these things can burn through a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
because these things can burn through a
lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> fuel<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> key<00:01:52.680> thing<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.920> driving

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
lot of fuel so the key thing is driving

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
lot of fuel so the key thing is driving
it<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.850> steady<00:01:54.180> rate<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.659> we're<00:01:54.810> not

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it at a really steady rate so we're not

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.319 
it at a really steady rate so we're not
wasting<00:01:55.170> any<00:01:55.560> resources<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.939> grow<00:01:57.210> as

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
wasting any resources and we can grow as

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
wasting any resources and we can grow as
efficiently<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:57.960> possible<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> keep<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
efficiently as possible to keep the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.200
