00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.889
 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.379
 today we are in a new news of 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.619
 playstation attention because it seems to be 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.740
 that return the problems to playstation 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.199
 network and you already know how good the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.180
 Sunday afternoon to early morning 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.370
 Monday 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.490
 playstation network was the victim of a 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.290
 s attack truth is that it was an end 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.460
 frenzied week was in 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.760
 playstation network 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.790
 then it was the servers of xbox live at 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.790
 the button and roll 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.360
 heston really was pretty much everything 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.449
 and is that it was crazy was not attributed to him 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.010
 apart from all this madness not to a 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.260
 group of hackers that called the lizard 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.289
 square 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 all this made the network 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 inaccessible for almost a whole day 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 are and postponed the maintenance of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.780
 Monday and apparently again 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 editions have problems 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 you can read like this in the official account of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 a company between twitter and a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 company is aware of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 difficulties they are experiencing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.270
 some users when trying to enter 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 your account I have been able to enter but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 example there are users who disconnects or 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 he just can not play when they're 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.819
 playing you check that does not mean that 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.250
 you are playing the same are 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.899
 having their engineers already in trouble 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.310
 they have put their hands to the hour for 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.070
 find the solution 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.439
 the maximum possible brevity 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.540
 do not really know I 'm 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.740
 investigating in the official account of 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.630
 chalk and about 3 hours ago 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.220
 this hacker group has turned to 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.590
 make mention of his longing that is 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.110
 Quite likely 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.710
 well, what 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 that they have become again 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 I really do not know how they can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.400
 get after doing it once 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.590
 doing it two is quite worthwhile and 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.690
 well let's see what happens with the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.580
 servers we will have to be 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.860
 pending on any update 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.960
 to keep you informed 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 I do not know if we hope that this time 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.820
 also be only ds attacks or 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.790
 simply be errors what is 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.860
 Of course, it's not maintenance 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.510
 it is very clear so we will continue 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 informing many thanks to all for 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.470
 be there and see you in the next one and 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.660
 you know leave your like that is very 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.660
 important we see the next chao
