wheedle engineering it also has a
standoff<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.399> at

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
standoff this is what you see here at

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
standoff this is what you see here at
the<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.000> standoff<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.440> fact

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the back that standoff here is in fact

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
the back that standoff here is in fact
in<00:01:01.949> chrome<00:01:02.370> along<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> flange<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:04.110> well

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
in chrome along with the flange as well

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
in chrome along with the flange as well
and<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.949> allows<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> surface<00:01:06.030> mount

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and that allows you to surface mount

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
and that allows you to surface mount
this<00:01:06.479> light<00:01:06.780> should<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> need<00:01:07.619> arise<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.189> can

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this light should the need arise you can

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
this light should the need arise you can
also<00:01:08.520> recess<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.299> well<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.170> right

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
also recess it in as well but this right

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
also recess it in as well but this right
now<00:01:10.560> has<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.890> surface<00:01:11.580> mount<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:12.000> why

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
now has been surface mount that's why

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
now has been surface mount that's why
it's<00:01:12.299> standing<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.110> giving<00:01:13.500> some

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it's standing out like this giving some

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's standing out like this giving some
pretty<00:01:14.189> serious<00:01:14.430> intersection<00:01:15.210> protection

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
pretty serious intersection protection

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.140 
pretty serious intersection protection
as<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.560> move<00:01:16.710> along<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> rig<00:01:17.790> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
as we move along here the rig actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.679 
as we move along here the rig actually
happens<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.720> rescue<00:01:19.500> 49<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.090> tillamook

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
happens to be rescue 49 at the tillamook

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.670 
happens to be rescue 49 at the tillamook
fire<00:01:22.110> district<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> mount<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.560> the

roof of the rig we actually have a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899 
roof of the rig we actually have a

relevant color configurations been set

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
relevant color configurations been set
up<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:32.130> thing<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.610> little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
up here one thing which is a little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
up here one thing which is a little
unusual<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> particular<00:01:33.780> customer

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
unusual with this particular customer

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
unusual with this particular customer
wanted<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:35.070> did<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.880> colored

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
wanted they did want to have colored

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
wanted they did want to have colored
lenses<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> respective<00:01:38.460> LED<00:01:38.880> modules

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
lenses over the respective LED modules

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
lenses over the respective LED modules
so<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> diodes<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.229> happen<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> blue

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so the diodes in here happen to be blue

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160 
so the diodes in here happen to be blue
but<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.729> also<00:01:41.909> wanted<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.689> blue<00:01:42.930> lens

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
but they also wanted to have a blue lens
