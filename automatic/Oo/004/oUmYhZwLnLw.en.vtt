00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.570
 mk arthur in 2014 was a 20 year old 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.960
 anniversary of this model which is for the first time well 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.660
 somehow not strange was invented in 1994 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 year anniversary this gave us a great 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.329
 number of exclusive colors 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.500
 collaborations and of course reprints 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.370
 these sneakers are originally 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.469
 running 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.870
 but now I like them with pleasure 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.030
 Most wear like life style shoes and 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.760
 glad that you agree 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.260

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.289
 perhaps with the name cordura this us all 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.230
 top sneaker so to speak material 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.359
 here this white speck cardura this 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.300
 the material was originally intended for 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.700
 army well it's thick nylon fabric 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 she's still there with water repellent 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.060
 impregnation well and how I got up and I know 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.220
 polyurethane coated yet 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.590
 is added as I understood in this material 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 up to ten percent of the buttons that just 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.150
 is told on the feeling of a certain 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.550
 velvety well and this stuff 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.870
 actually very very light and 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.240
 Of course I will summarize 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.850
 This same I will express that also this 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.220
 durable material as you understood is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.160
 and water repellent and durable it to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.110
 erasure well what else for happiness to us and 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.820
 well, and here is the designation of this 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.590
 technology of this material 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.800
 here is such our barrels here 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.960
 present still here represented 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.300
 pump technology which allowed 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.610
 make this model a model even more 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.770
 easy because she agree here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.840
 replaces shoelaces 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 air pumped by this pump this 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.420
 button fills the tank and sneakers 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.200
 just thereby fixing on our 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.209
 legs and fixes again our foot well and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.849
 pressure actually oddly enough 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.690
 airy it does not press because I said 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.970
 there is air inside and so this whole 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.129
 pad there you see with the channels she 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.849

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.120
 and we see how the air goes down there 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.080
 that is, the relief is no longer here and 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 Observe so still I will point out that there are such 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.110
 reflective material present 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.240
 as on these loops well or loops 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.790
 also well and also on the toes of these 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.470
 running shoes 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 Well, I will give stuffing material of course 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.120

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.770
 comfort and here still inside hidden backdrop 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.820
 well, thereby our leg still 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.190
 extra fix these sneakers in 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.530
 The sole of this model is represented 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.790
 Hexa light technology here for 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.010
 depreciation is seen in such here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.320
 window can be said in two places in 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.209
 outsole 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.489
 Well, in the middle of the plate is present 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.640
 the sole of the twisted and which gives 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.500
 also additional responsiveness well 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.930
 Of course I still need to mention about 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.780
 such a sole is divided she 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.700
 as you will see in two parts well this and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.440
 additionally facilitated the model because 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.200
 agree when such a piece 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.269
 Sole removed of course mass 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.540
 decreases but you can also add 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.180
 that it is very comfortable unusual sensations 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.230
 from trying on these sneakers think this is all 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.280
 the owners of these pairs will confirm well and down 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.980

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.880
 durable rubber so but now peredem to 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:07.549
