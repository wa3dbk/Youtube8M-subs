00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
one feature just kind of figured out

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
one feature just kind of figured out
here<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.520> does<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:40.100> throttle<00:00:41.180> limit<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.140> if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
here it does have a throttle limit so if

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
here it does have a throttle limit so if
you<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> young<00:00:43.950> kid<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.340> something<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you have a young kid or something and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
you have a young kid or something and
put<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.270> low<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> reduces<00:00:46.050> speed<00:00:46.860> or

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
put it on low and it reduces speed or

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.729 
put it on low and it reduces speed or
you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.820> high<00:00:48.000> speed<00:00:48.390> slower<00:00:49.260> or

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you can go to the high speed slower or

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.319 
you can go to the high speed slower or
that<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.219> used<00:00:50.460> depending<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.180> the

nickel metal out it was very good but
that's<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.500> most<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.950> us<00:02:12.069> do<00:02:12.280> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.700> go

that's like most of us do want to go

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.640 
that's like most of us do want to go
right<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.180> lipo<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:13.959> put<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.140> 3<00:02:14.349> shell

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
right to lipo so we do put a 3 shell

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.339 
right to lipo so we do put a 3 shell
lipo<00:02:15.099> right<00:02:15.340> into<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.760> big<00:02:16.150> 1300<00:02:16.989> fits<00:02:17.200> in

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
lipo right into this big 1300 fits in

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.289 
lipo right into this big 1300 fits in
there<00:02:17.470> very<00:02:17.530> nice<00:02:17.980> little<00:02:18.250> snug<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:19.150> can
