00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
even if one does go off its it is quite

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.720 
even if one does go off its it is quite
a<00:02:57.470> lot<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.709> damage<00:02:57.890> but<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.280> nothing<00:02:58.549> that's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
a lot of damage but it's nothing that's

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.430 
a lot of damage but it's nothing that's
like<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.030> can't<00:02:59.239> really<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.510> just<00:03:00.170> need<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
like you can't really you just need to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.289 
like you can't really you just need to
make<00:03:00.560> sure<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.070> always<00:03:01.519> had<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.030> most

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
make sure that you always had the most

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.030 
make sure that you always had the most
you<00:03:02.570> should<00:03:02.720> only<00:03:02.870> ever<00:03:02.989> have<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.530> mine<00:03:03.799> up

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
you should only ever have one mine up

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.009 
you should only ever have one mine up
when<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.400> do<00:03:04.459> decide<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.970> explode<00:03:05.510> now

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
when they do decide to explode now

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.319 
when they do decide to explode now
ultimately<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:07.100> tank<00:03:07.579> should<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:08.060> able<00:03:08.150> to

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
ultimately a tank should be able to

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.110 
ultimately a tank should be able to
solar<00:03:08.600> all<00:03:08.810> these<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:10.459> realistically

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
solar all these and but realistically

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.090 
solar all these and but realistically
there<00:03:11.660> will<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:11.900> situations<00:03:12.440> where<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.859> tank

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
there will be situations where the tank

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.830 
there will be situations where the tank
would<00:03:13.280> just<00:03:13.459> be<00:03:13.579> spent<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.090> cooldowns<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
would just be spent on cooldowns and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.740 
would just be spent on cooldowns and
will<00:03:15.260> need<00:03:15.440> help<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.340> other<00:03:17.090> people<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.600> help

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
will need help so other people can help

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.210 
will need help so other people can help
this<00:03:17.959> by<00:03:18.170> using<00:03:18.380> their<00:03:18.620> own<00:03:18.650> impersonal

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
this by using their own impersonal

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.130 
this by using their own impersonal
cooldowns

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
cooldowns

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.720 
cooldowns
but<00:03:21.319> immunity<00:03:21.709> such<00:03:22.160> as<00:03:22.310> blessing<00:03:22.640> or

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
but immunity such as blessing or

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.729 
but immunity such as blessing or
protection<00:03:23.180> will<00:03:23.480> work<00:03:23.720> yeah<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.440> if<00:03:24.650> you're

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
protection will work yeah so if you're

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.710 
protection will work yeah so if you're
very<00:03:24.980> very<00:03:25.190> quick<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:26.420> use<00:03:26.600> your

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
very very quick you can use your

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.780 
very very quick you can use your
immunity<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.200> get<00:03:27.530> one<00:03:27.799> or<00:03:27.950> two<00:03:27.980> mines<00:03:28.370> which

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
immunity and get one or two mines which

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.090 
immunity and get one or two mines which
is<00:03:29.030> awesome<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.660> yeah<00:03:30.500> that's<00:03:30.769> all<00:03:30.889> you<00:03:30.950> need

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
is awesome and yeah that's all you need

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.199 
is awesome and yeah that's all you need
to<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.250> at<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.370> mines<00:03:31.549> very<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:31.940> simple

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
to do at the mines very very simple

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.150 
to do at the mines very very simple
mechanic<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.810> it's<00:03:33.079> just<00:03:33.230> fundamental<00:03:34.069> that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
mechanic but it's just fundamental that

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.860 
mechanic but it's just fundamental that
you<00:03:34.220> deal<00:03:34.430> them<00:03:34.639> otherwise<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.510> will<00:03:35.690> wipe

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
you deal them otherwise you will wipe

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.629 
you deal them otherwise you will wipe
now<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.590> only<00:03:36.829> other<00:03:37.069> ability<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.549> you

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
now the only other ability that you

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.099 
now the only other ability that you
really<00:03:37.940> need<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.150> worry<00:03:38.359> about<00:03:38.389> in<00:03:38.660> phase<00:03:38.840> 1

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
really need to worry about in phase 1

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.960 
really need to worry about in phase 1
which<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.739> for<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:39.950> tanks<00:03:40.370> which<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.670> flame

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
which is for the tanks which is flame

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.599 
which is for the tanks which is flame
vents<00:03:41.359> now<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:42.049> is<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> very<00:03:42.769> high<00:03:43.160> damaged

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
vents now this is a very high damaged

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.910 
vents now this is a very high damaged
frontal<00:03:44.389> cone<00:03:44.510> ability<00:03:44.989> with<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.560> boss<00:03:45.709> does

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
frontal cone ability with the boss does

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.340 
frontal cone ability with the boss does
it<00:03:46.069> hits<00:03:46.190> around<00:03:46.400> 300k<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:47.690> when<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:47.989> are<00:03:48.139> off

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
it hits around 300k so when you are off

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.780 
it hits around 300k so when you are off
tanking<00:03:48.769> when<00:03:48.889> you're<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.069> actually<00:03:49.190> tanking

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
tanking when you're not actually tanking

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.620 
tanking when you're not actually tanking
the<00:03:49.880> boss<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.150> need<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.329> make<00:03:50.480> sure<00:03:50.510> that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
the boss you need to make sure that

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.120 
the boss you need to make sure that
you're<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:50.989> stood<00:03:51.350> on<00:03:51.620> top<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.920> where<00:03:52.040> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
you're not stood on top of where the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.289 
you're not stood on top of where the
other<00:03:52.250> tank<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.670> because<00:03:52.910> otherwise<00:03:53.090> you'll

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
other tank is because otherwise you'll

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.059 
other tank is because otherwise you'll
both<00:03:53.540> take<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.930> damage<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.650> not<00:03:54.799> only<00:03:54.859> does

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
both take the damage and not only does

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.860 
both take the damage and not only does
it<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:55.340> damage<00:03:55.670> it'll<00:03:55.880> also<00:03:56.000> play<00:03:56.329> a<00:03:56.359> debuff

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
it do damage it'll also play a debuff

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.360 
it do damage it'll also play a debuff
that<00:03:57.109> increases<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.799> amount<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.040> damage<00:03:58.340> you

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that increases the amount of damage you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.150 
that increases the amount of damage you
take<00:03:58.670> from<00:03:58.819> fire<00:03:59.150> by<00:03:59.840> 10%<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.920> will<00:04:01.010> also

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
take from fire by 10% and it will also

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.470 
take from fire by 10% and it will also
leave<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.489> tick<00:04:01.819> on<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.120> which<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.450> really

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
leave a tick on you which is really

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.460 
leave a tick on you which is really
quite<00:04:02.900> nasty

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
quite nasty

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.410 
quite nasty
and<00:04:03.650> obviously<00:04:03.859> this<00:04:04.160> ability<00:04:04.400> does<00:04:04.730> stack<00:04:05.030> so

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
and obviously this ability does stack so

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.729 
and obviously this ability does stack so
you<00:04:05.480> need<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.840> make<00:04:05.989> sure<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.379> taunt<00:04:06.620> on

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
you need to make sure that you taunt on

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.100 
you need to make sure that you taunt on
around<00:04:06.980> 2<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.400> 3<00:04:07.640> depending<00:04:08.269> on<00:04:08.390> when<00:04:08.569> you're

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
around 2 to 3 depending on when you're

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.660 
around 2 to 3 depending on when you're
has<00:04:09.320> dropped<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.010> as<00:04:10.100> long<00:04:10.160> as<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.520> deal

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
has dropped so as long as you can deal

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.430 
has dropped so as long as you can deal
with<00:04:10.700> all<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.180> those<00:04:11.270> mechanics<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.080> basically

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
with all of those mechanics so basically

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.490 
with all of those mechanics so basically
move<00:04:13.040> out<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.430> or<00:04:13.730> drill<00:04:14.150> more<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.600> cannon<00:04:15.110> click

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
move out of or drill more a cannon click

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.650 
move out of or drill more a cannon click
on<00:04:15.680> spawn<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.609> mines<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.209> tank<00:04:17.450> swap

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
on spawn of the mines and tank swap

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.270 
on spawn of the mines and tank swap
which<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.200> pretty<00:04:18.470> much<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.709> only<00:04:19.070> thing<00:04:19.220> you

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
which is pretty much the only thing you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.009

spamming AoE damage on the Raider the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.200 
spamming AoE damage on the Raider the
only<00:04:31.070> thing<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.250> can<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.490> do<00:04:31.760> with<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.030> is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
only thing you can really do with it is

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.250

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
however you can't really stack up

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.580 
however you can't really stack up
because<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.450> boss<00:04:35.630> would<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.870> random<00:04:36.260> spike

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
because the boss would be random spike

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.650 
because the boss would be random spike
damage<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.130> players<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.090> spike<00:04:38.360> damage

six-yard spread that you need to be so

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320 
six-yard spread that you need to be so

this phase the boss will still throw his
mines<00:04:49.669> out<00:04:49.940> however<00:04:50.300> because<00:04:50.510> both<00:04:50.900> tanks<00:04:51.140> are

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
mines out however because both tanks are

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.530 
mines out however because both tanks are

will also send out a bunch of explosive
tar<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.770> this<00:05:27.979> would<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:28.190> go<00:05:28.370> in<00:05:28.520> all<00:05:28.729> random

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
tar and this would just go in all random

ticking nature damage so don't stand in

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.340 
ticking nature damage so don't stand in
the<00:05:37.400> tar<00:05:37.640> it<00:05:38.210> doesn't<00:05:38.479> hurt<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.690> much<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:39.200> mean

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
the tar it doesn't hurt that much I mean

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.810 
the tar it doesn't hurt that much I mean
really<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.770> tire<00:05:40.010> you<00:05:40.130> don't<00:05:40.310> really<00:05:40.460> have<00:05:40.669> to

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
really the tire you don't really have to

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.270 
really the tire you don't really have to
worry<00:05:41.360> about<00:05:41.660> too<00:05:41.990> much<00:05:42.200> however<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.860> tar<00:05:43.070> is

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
worry about too much however the tar is

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.980 
worry about too much however the tar is
affected<00:05:43.729> by<00:05:43.880> his<00:05:44.060> next<00:05:44.330> ability<00:05:44.510> which<00:05:44.960> is

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
affected by his next ability which is

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.380 
affected by his next ability which is
cutting<00:05:45.470> laser<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.610> his<00:05:46.790> tail<00:05:47.030> will<00:05:47.240> like

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.360 
cutting laser so his tail will like
light<00:05:47.660> up<00:05:47.870> and<00:05:48.140> it<00:05:48.260> will<00:05:48.320> start<00:05:48.620> targeting<00:05:49.280> a

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
light up and it will start targeting a

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.430 
light up and it will start targeting a
random<00:05:49.790> player<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.390> will<00:05:50.720> begin<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:51.200> chase

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
random player and will begin to chase

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.010 
random player and will begin to chase
that<00:05:51.919> target<00:05:52.430> with<00:05:52.580> like<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.970> massive<00:05:53.510> red<00:05:53.750> beam

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
that target with like a massive red beam

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.550 
that target with like a massive red beam
now<00:05:54.740> this<00:05:55.700> red<00:05:55.940> beam<00:05:56.150> will<00:05:56.330> duel<00:05:56.510> 200k<00:05:57.200> damage

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
now this red beam will duel 200k damage

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.320 
now this red beam will duel 200k damage
to<00:05:57.770> any<00:05:57.950> players<00:05:58.340> that<00:05:58.610> are<00:05:58.729> in<00:05:58.820> contact<00:05:59.240> with

to any players that are in contact with

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.570 
to any players that are in contact with
it<00:05:59.570> so<00:05:59.840> if<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.530> is<00:06:00.650> chasing<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.190> you<00:06:01.220> need<00:06:01.490> to

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
it so if it is chasing you you need to

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.400 
it so if it is chasing you you need to
make<00:06:01.700> sure<00:06:01.729> that<00:06:01.850> you<00:06:02.060> Chi<00:06:02.270> it<00:06:02.330> away<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:02.930> don't

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
make sure that you Chi it away and don't

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.159 
make sure that you Chi it away and don't
cut<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:03.919> over<00:06:04.310> other<00:06:04.550> players<00:06:04.820> however<00:06:05.750> if<00:06:06.050> the

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
cut it over other players however if the

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.380 
cut it over other players however if the
cutting<00:06:06.530> laser<00:06:06.710> does<00:06:07.130> actually<00:06:07.400> touch<00:06:07.880> a<00:06:08.090> tar

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
cutting laser does actually touch a tar

pool

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
pool

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.510 
pool
it<00:06:09.110> will<00:06:09.229> explode<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.890> do<00:06:09.979> a<00:06:10.010> raid<00:06:10.310> wide

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
it will explode and do a raid wide

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.520 
it will explode and do a raid wide
airway<00:06:10.910> and<00:06:11.180> it<00:06:11.300> isn't<00:06:11.540> that<00:06:11.600> large<00:06:11.900> it<00:06:12.229> never

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530

actually<00:06:12.680> happened<00:06:12.919> for<00:06:13.280> us<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.460> we<00:06:13.550> never

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
actually happened for us so we never

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.210 
actually happened for us so we never
actually<00:06:13.880> saw<00:06:14.180> it<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.690> hits<00:06:14.900> around<00:06:15.200> 200<00:06:15.800> K<00:06:15.950> so

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
actually saw it it hits around 200 K so

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.820 
actually saw it it hits around 200 K so
make<00:06:16.430> sure<00:06:16.700> that<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:16.970> never<00:06:17.180> ever

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
make sure that you never ever

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.649 
make sure that you never ever
over<00:06:18.370> one<00:06:18.520> of<00:06:18.610> these<00:06:18.699> pools<00:06:19.000> while<00:06:19.509> the

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
over one of these pools while the

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.420 
over one of these pools while the
cutting<00:06:19.930> laser<00:06:20.110> is<00:06:20.409> active<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:21.039> can<00:06:21.069> also

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
cutting laser is active you can also

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.369 
cutting laser is active you can also
receive<00:06:21.879> the<00:06:22.030> shock<00:06:22.210> bolts<00:06:22.629> so<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.169> should

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
receive the shock bolts so you should

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.619 
receive the shock bolts so you should
always<00:06:23.560> try<00:06:23.919> and<00:06:24.069> equate<00:06:24.370> in<00:06:24.580> your<00:06:24.729> head<00:06:24.940> if<00:06:25.509> a

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
always try and equate in your head if a

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.899 
always try and equate in your head if a
shock<00:06:25.810> pulse<00:06:25.990> comes<00:06:26.259> in<00:06:26.440> now<00:06:26.620> will<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.699> cutter

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
shock pulse comes in now will the cutter

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.029 
shock pulse comes in now will the cutter
go<00:06:28.120> over<00:06:28.360> at<00:06:28.479> our<00:06:28.840> pool<00:06:29.020> yeah<00:06:29.650> you<00:06:29.889> need<00:06:30.009> to

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
go over at our pool yeah you need to

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.710 
go over at our pool yeah you need to
think<00:06:30.280> that<00:06:30.370> in<00:06:30.580> your<00:06:30.759> head<00:06:30.940> but<00:06:31.330> generally

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
think that in your head but generally

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.320 
think that in your head but generally
it's<00:06:31.960> not<00:06:32.199> too<00:06:32.379> difficult<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.849> explosive

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
it's not too difficult and the explosive

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330 
it's not too difficult and the explosive
toy<00:06:34.479> itself<00:06:34.840> does<00:06:35.169> the<00:06:35.349> spawn<00:06:35.740> after<00:06:36.159> about<00:06:36.280> a

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
toy itself does the spawn after about a

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.249 
toy itself does the spawn after about a
minute<00:06:36.729> or<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.030> so<00:06:37.300> you<00:06:37.690> don't<00:06:37.870> really<00:06:37.990> need<00:06:38.139> to

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
minute or so so you don't really need to

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:39.629 
minute or so so you don't really need to
worry<00:06:38.409> about<00:06:38.470> moving<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.889> boss<00:06:39.069> either<00:06:39.280> it's

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
worry about moving the boss either it's

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.369 
worry about moving the boss either it's
not<00:06:39.849> really<00:06:40.090> a<00:06:40.120> massive<00:06:40.449> deal<00:06:40.659> this<00:06:41.169> phase

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379 
not really a massive deal this phase

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.020 
not really a massive deal this phase
it's<00:06:41.680> just<00:06:41.830> all<00:06:41.919> about<00:06:42.009> out<00:06:42.250> healing<00:06:42.639> and<00:06:42.819> not

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
it's just all about out healing and not

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.330 
it's just all about out healing and not
getting<00:06:43.479> caught<00:06:43.720> by<00:06:44.080> the<00:06:44.110> cutting<00:06:44.860> laser<00:06:45.009> just

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
getting caught by the cutting laser just

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.430 
getting caught by the cutting laser just
healer<00:06:45.610> pretty<00:06:46.090> simple<00:06:46.509> so<00:06:46.840> as<00:06:47.050> long<00:06:47.199> as<00:06:47.349> you

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
healer pretty simple so as long as you

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.379 
healer pretty simple so as long as you
can<00:06:47.590> really<00:06:47.830> master<00:06:48.039> the<00:06:48.610> phase<00:06:48.819> 1<00:06:49.120> and<00:06:49.330> the

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
can really master the phase 1 and the

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.240 
can really master the phase 1 and the
phase<00:06:49.569> 2<00:06:49.930> you<00:06:50.169> shouldn't<00:06:50.800> have<00:06:50.889> too<00:06:51.069> much<00:06:51.190> of

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
phase 2 you shouldn't have too much of

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.830 
phase 2 you shouldn't have too much of
an<00:06:51.669> issue<00:06:51.789> because<00:06:52.000> once<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.509> boss<00:06:52.659> of<00:06:52.810> course

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
an issue because once the boss of course

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.450 
an issue because once the boss of course
either<00:06:53.110> switches<00:06:53.620> from<00:06:53.740> phase<00:06:54.009> 1<00:06:54.219> to<00:06:54.310> phase<00:06:54.340> 2

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
either switches from phase 1 to phase 2

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.700 
either switches from phase 1 to phase 2
phase<00:06:54.849> 1<00:06:55.030> to<00:06:55.150> phase<00:06:55.180> 2<00:06:55.300> phase<00:06:55.629> 1<00:06:55.840> to<00:06:55.930> phase<00:06:55.960> 2<00:06:56.110> so

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
phase 1 to phase 2 phase 1 to phase 2 so

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.529 
phase 1 to phase 2 phase 1 to phase 2 so
overall<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.490> fight<00:06:57.669> itself<00:06:58.030> not<00:06:58.389> that

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
overall the fight itself not that

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:00.510 
overall the fight itself not that
difficult<00:06:58.750> but<00:06:59.199> it<00:06:59.259> is<00:06:59.349> very<00:06:59.560> fun<00:06:59.860> especially

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
difficult but it is very fun especially

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.129 
difficult but it is very fun especially
the<00:07:00.669> knock-back<00:07:00.849> mechanic<00:07:01.569> that's<00:07:01.930> probably

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139 
the knock-back mechanic that's probably

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:03.899 
the knock-back mechanic that's probably
my<00:07:02.259> favorite<00:07:02.440> one<00:07:02.800> did<00:07:03.460> she<00:07:03.580> just<00:07:03.729> go

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
my favorite one did she just go

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.550 
my favorite one did she just go
literally<00:07:04.389> flying<00:07:04.750> if<00:07:05.050> someone's<00:07:05.349> in<00:07:05.469> the

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
literally flying if someone's in the

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.559 
literally flying if someone's in the
wrong<00:07:05.680> place<00:07:05.949> very<00:07:06.280> very<00:07:06.520> funny<00:07:06.759> but<00:07:07.300> yeah

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:07.569 
wrong place very very funny but yeah

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.089 
wrong place very very funny but yeah
overall<00:07:07.990> fairly<00:07:08.319> simple<00:07:08.680> fight<00:07:08.889> you

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:09.099 
overall fairly simple fight you

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.379 
overall fairly simple fight you
shouldn't<00:07:09.310> have<00:07:09.400> too<00:07:09.550> much<00:07:09.699> issues<00:07:10.090> on<00:07:10.240> this

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389
