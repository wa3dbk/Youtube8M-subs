00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 I advise you to visit the project orchid mine 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.620
 almost like peat craft only perfect 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.030
 money well, in general, this is a project of cheeses 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 which you can play as 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.920
 sandboxie moats and so on hightech 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.289
 the server project has just opened so 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 many more where you can build and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 become the pioneer of these new worlds 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 well now let's watch the mod link 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 by the way on perfect money will be in the description 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 Hello everyone, we are with you today. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 we will ride a turtle in general 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 today's mod that I put on 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.969
 my graph will add to this very mikroft 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.219
 new mobs different-different breakwaters well all 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.920
 4 not really so much but all of them 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.210
 combines one thing they are all nasty 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 reptiles are ugly enough i'll tell you 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 what to do if you met such 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.700
 healthy turtle I do n't even know my 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 understanding the bug is so small 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 bug Fedya who will be somewhere there 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.030
 run around the apartment how to run 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 move slowly in the morning in her 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
 put one end of the room in the evening 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 she got to the other one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 so for me the turtles look but it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.909
 turtle 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.640
 awesome she really awesome 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.640
 for example us on with the growth of a turtle 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.750
 Godzilla somehow we get here 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.729
 hefty but not so great i 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.979
 of course godzilla but nevertheless in general 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.799
 here is such a turtle and it is different 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.200
 so that you can sit on it but as you can see 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.900
 you can move around on it but it will 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.630
 not so fast she can just 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.390
 get up and stand still and how now why are you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.700
 don't move turtle let's run and run 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 although I saw the video where the turtle 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.509
 moved fast enough and as you can see 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 over there we have one more ahead 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.659
 turtle 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 that is, these turtles themselves are different 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.710
 types this you some jungle vaio 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 the turtle and on it is also possible in principle 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.579
 ride what fast what speed 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.220
 just elusive 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 but in fact not and also if 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 kill the turtle what in my opinion 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.689
 is an extreme degree of slaughter 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.850
 well we will do it in place and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.619
 appears in the chest is enough 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.990
 strangely apparently she leaves in place 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.899
 its death its shell that we 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.030
 we fold things but as you see wear on 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.330
 so it works that is to the place of death 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.970
 turtles there is a little chest here 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.980
 here and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 honest turtles and look on and on 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.470
 we have to fashion or here such 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.170
 nasty creature but was far cry 3 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.690
 remember there were such hefty lizards 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.210
 he has a healthy tongue and here it is already 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.910
 drive will not work for more 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.320
 my she even aggressive right dresser 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.740
 how do you want to talk to me 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.990
 as you can see she is aggressive if you are her 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.600
 strike similarly so let's 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.060
 back to the creative mode and from it explosions 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.050
 only pickled spider eye drops out 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.870
 I do not know why 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.820
 how did he get into the dresser 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.040
 pickled spider eye i can 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.459
 explain it only to the fact that this is the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 a hefty lizard devoured the regiment here 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.130
 such a second one in this mod could 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 in fashion it sounds funny looking at 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.209
 next and next we have a crocodile 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.980
 which will appear advantage 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.050
 here such 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.270
 reservoirs in the jungle and I'll tell you here 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.000
 he is really dangerous 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.500
 as you can see he is over on such and such 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 all that moves he can gobble 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.180
 calm some lamb or so 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.760
 further and his health is quite a lot 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.040
 how do you see lizards why are you now 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.400
 on our side but even they are in my 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.680
 did not immediately kill this hefty 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.489
 as you can see by the way who are very lizards 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.400
 many and yes even that's how much was seven 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.500
 here are these healthy dressers lizards they even 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480
 could not and immediately kill the crocodile that 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.310
 shows as much as he is cool 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
 As you can see, with one blow he strikes you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.260
 one and a half heart damage so it's better than him 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.400
 quickly kill and somehow for example 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.709
 diamond sword 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.860
 Well, the last mod is just the same 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.780
 such a small lizard as unhealthy 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.970
 here is this dresser fucking a little 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.430
 little lizard which is harmless 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.620
 will bask in the sand and that's enough 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.170
 nice to her unfortunately to do nothing 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.930
 you can not just watch 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.150
 for her well, you can and of course push but to 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.519
 Unfortunately nothing else can move 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.950
 she is damn smart if you attack something 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.769
 she will run away from you won't even try 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.859
 give you change but better don't do that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.140
 with hefty lizards that are fashionable 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.320
 and so in general, this is such a friend 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.570
 by the way how can you see they are stupid enough 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.230
 lizards and try to bask in the card 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.180
 let's save this failed to save well 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.040
 Well, in general, friends are such a mod 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 which adds mikroft reptiles this 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.120
 cool enough and link to it 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.590
 you will find in the description 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.090
