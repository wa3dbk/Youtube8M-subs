approach to any questions okay not many
people<00:02:46.300> are<00:02:46.630> really<00:02:47.620> familiar<00:02:47.920> with<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.819> well

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
people are really familiar with the well

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.660 
people are really familiar with the well
details<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.780> connect<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.620> second<00:02:54.459> and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
details how to connect the second and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.240 
details how to connect the second and
third<00:02:54.880> trailer<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:56.050> what<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.739> order<00:02:57.040> to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
third trailer but what in order to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.400 
third trailer but what in order to
succeed<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.209> double-triple<00:02:58.780> test<00:02:59.230> you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
succeed in the double-triple test you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.540 
succeed in the double-triple test you
just<00:02:59.530> need<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.540> apply<00:03:01.540> general<00:03:02.410> logic<00:03:02.830> so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
just need to apply general logic so

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.870 
just need to apply general logic so
again<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.840> are<00:03:04.870> asked<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.380> you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
again you are asked at you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.750 
again you are asked at you
you<00:03:06.880> open<00:03:07.300> service<00:03:07.660> line<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.709> what<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.430> need

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you open service line so what you need

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.509 
you open service line so what you need
to<00:03:10.000> hear<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.690> definitely<00:03:11.530> air<00:03:11.650> escape<00:03:12.040> because

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
to hear is definitely air escape because

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.720 
to hear is definitely air escape because
what<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.840> air<00:03:14.800> line<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.340> service

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
what it is in the air line in service

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.380 
what it is in the air line in service
line<00:03:15.970> air<00:03:17.130> okay

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
line air okay

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.080 
line air okay
question<00:03:19.390> two<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.650> are<00:03:20.920> driving<00:03:21.280> with<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
question two you are driving with the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.890 
question two you are driving with the
double<00:03:23.010> trailers<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.280> must<00:03:24.880> use<00:03:25.180> your<00:03:25.209> brakes

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
double trailers and must use your brakes

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.640 
double trailers and must use your brakes
to<00:03:26.079> avoid<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.829> crash<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.840> emergency<00:03:29.410> braking

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
to avoid a crash for emergency braking

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.870 
to avoid a crash for emergency braking
you<00:03:29.950> should<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:31.329> question<00:03:32.459> reminds<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880

right moving to the right for example
question

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:09.399 
question

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:13.739 
question
I<00:05:09.429> mean<00:05:09.849> option<00:05:10.239> B<00:05:10.799> in<00:05:12.089> tries<00:05:13.089> to<00:05:13.299> trick<00:05:13.539> you

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:13.749 
I mean option B in tries to trick you

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.929 
I mean option B in tries to trick you
you<00:05:13.959> can<00:05:14.110> almost<00:05:14.319> always<00:05:14.619> stop<00:05:15.219> more<00:05:15.579> quickly

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
you can almost always stop more quickly

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.529 
you can almost always stop more quickly
then<00:05:16.299> you<00:05:16.329> can<00:05:16.719> turn<00:05:17.039> wrong<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:19.089> opposite

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
then you can turn wrong the the opposite

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.549 
then you can turn wrong the the opposite
is<00:05:19.719> true<00:05:19.749> you<00:05:20.349> can<00:05:20.379> almost<00:05:20.829> always<00:05:22.019> turn<00:05:23.019> more

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:23.559 
is true you can almost always turn more

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.549 
is true you can almost always turn more
quickly<00:05:23.949> that's<00:05:24.639> why<00:05:24.939> I<00:05:24.969> repeat<00:05:25.659> you<00:05:25.959> need<00:05:26.319> to

uh-huh<00:06:47.560> again<00:06:48.550> general<00:06:49.000> logic<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:49.479> just<00:06:49.720> need

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
uh-huh again general logic you just need

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.950 
uh-huh again general logic you just need
to<00:06:50.190> figure<00:06:51.190> out<00:06:51.310> what<00:06:51.759> it<00:06:51.910> doli<00:06:52.150> convert<00:06:52.810> to

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
to figure out what it doli convert to

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.249 
to figure out what it doli convert to
dolly<00:06:53.229> is<00:06:53.620> some<00:06:54.190> some<00:06:54.759> device<00:06:55.270> which<00:06:55.750> is<00:06:55.960> used

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
dolly is some some device which is used

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.270 
dolly is some some device which is used
to<00:06:56.590> connect<00:06:57.220> the<00:06:58.120> first<00:06:58.750> and<00:06:59.110> second<00:06:59.889> trailer

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
to connect the first and second trailer

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.920 
to connect the first and second trailer
so<00:07:00.699> definitely<00:07:01.449> it<00:07:01.509> should<00:07:01.690> be<00:07:01.840> open<00:07:02.259> okay

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
so definitely it should be open okay

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.920 
so definitely it should be open okay
question<00:07:04.930> number<00:07:04.960> five<00:07:05.349> to<00:07:06.340> check<00:07:06.669> if<00:07:07.449> the
