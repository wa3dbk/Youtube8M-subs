Paris Kevin of Roni
yes<00:00:27.300> myself<00:00:27.859> but<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> being<00:00:29.130> said<00:00:29.189> we

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
yes myself but that being said we

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.519 
yes myself but that being said we
arguably<00:00:30.269> thought<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.140> part<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
arguably thought you had the part of the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.709 
arguably thought you had the part of the
best<00:00:31.740> genetic<00:00:32.160> structure<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:33.000> but

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
best genetic structure up there but

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.940 
best genetic structure up there but
clearly<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.320> thought<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> could<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.829> been

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
clearly we thought you could have been

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
clearly we thought you could have been
in<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.309> condition<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> would

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
in better condition is that the would

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060 
in better condition is that the would
you<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> feedback<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.800> heard

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you get the kind of feedback you heard

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
you get the kind of feedback you heard
up<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.430> definitely<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> consensus<00:00:39.450> um

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
up that's definitely the consensus um

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
up that's definitely the consensus um
and<00:00:40.170> part<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> reason<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.100> condition<00:00:41.489> was

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and part of the reason my condition was

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
and part of the reason my condition was
a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.879> office<00:00:42.239> originally<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> plan<00:00:42.989> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a little office originally I plan on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.049 
a little office originally I plan on
being<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.350> super-heavy

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
being a super-heavy

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
being a super-heavy
then<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> last<00:00:45.300> minute<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:45.960> getting

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
then at the last minute you know getting

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
then at the last minute you know getting
feedback<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.280> judges<00:00:47.760> people<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> sport

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
feedback from judges people in the sport

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.610 
feedback from judges people in the sport
you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.050> thought<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> better

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you know they thought it was a better

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
you know they thought it was a better
decision<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> sink<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
decision that kind of sink down so I

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
decision that kind of sink down so I
think<00:00:52.350> filling<00:00:52.920> back<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> screwed

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
think filling back out kind of screwed

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.430 
think filling back out kind of screwed
up<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> water<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.809> everything<00:00:54.989> but

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
up you know the water and everything but

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.779 
up you know the water and everything but
I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.129> tighter<00:00:56.460> tonight

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I think I was a little tighter tonight

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
I think I was a little tighter tonight
but<00:00:57.149> yeah<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.510> agree<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:58.020> condition<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
but yeah I agree my condition could have

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.450 
but yeah I agree my condition could have
been<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.949> better

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
been a lot better

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
been a lot better
everyone<00:01:00.090> said<00:01:00.329> tonight<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.660> looked<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
everyone said tonight you looked a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.299 
everyone said tonight you looked a
little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.230> better<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.949> has<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> do

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
little bit better I think that has to do

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.770 
little bit better I think that has to do
with<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> through<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.090> prejudging

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
with you going through that prejudging

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.299 
with you going through that prejudging
and<00:01:03.930> having<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> squeeze<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.710> flex<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> pose

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and having to squeeze and flex and pose

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.950 
and having to squeeze and flex and pose
and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.519> suck<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.270> today<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.540> clearly

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and then suck it up for today so clearly

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440 
and then suck it up for today so clearly
it's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> timing<00:01:07.890> issue<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> being<00:01:09.360> said

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it's a timing issue but that being said

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's a timing issue but that being said
I<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:10.020> saying<00:01:10.200> earlier<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.860> thought

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I was saying earlier that I thought

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
I was saying earlier that I thought
maybe<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.790> into<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.090> pros<00:01:12.330> what'll<00:01:12.630> serve

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
maybe going into the pros what'll serve

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.330 
maybe going into the pros what'll serve
you<00:01:12.960> best<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.380> training<00:01:13.770> closer<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> your

you best is training closer to your

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
you best is training closer to your
competition<00:01:14.700> weight<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.960> decide<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
competition weight that you decide to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
competition weight that you decide to
make<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> next<00:01:17.400> big<00:01:17.520> step<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.150> don't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
make that next big step which I don't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
make that next big step which I don't
know<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:18.750> contemplated<00:01:19.470> 2014<00:01:20.009> yet

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
know have you even contemplated 2014 yet

know have you even contemplated 2014 yet
you<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.909> stuck<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.299> honestly<00:01:22.049> um<00:01:22.290> I'm

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
you got stuck this in honestly um I'm

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
you got stuck this in honestly um I'm
being<00:01:23.280> realistic<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:23.970> my<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.540> structure

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
being realistic I know my my structure

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
being realistic I know my my structure
you<00:01:25.020> know<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> work<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> think
