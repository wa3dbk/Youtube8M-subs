00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
going to flip it over if you look at the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.840 
going to flip it over if you look at the
base<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.380> first<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.280> all<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
base of it first of all this is the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.430 
base of it first of all this is the
weight<00:00:36.000> system<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> there's<00:00:36.809> 30<00:00:37.020> grams<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
weight system so there's 30 grams of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.930 
weight system so there's 30 grams of
weight<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.920> adjustable<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> has

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
weight that are adjustable and this has

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.750 
weight that are adjustable and this has
the<00:00:39.090> twin<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> 5600<00:00:40.350> laser<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.460> terms<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the twin I 5600 laser but in terms of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
the twin I 5600 laser but in terms of
adjustability<00:00:42.270> you'll<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.290> flange

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
adjustability you'll see this flange

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
adjustability you'll see this flange
right<00:00:43.950> right<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.300> actually<00:00:45.480> adjust

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
right right here I can actually adjust

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
right right here I can actually adjust
this<00:00:46.289> forward<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.280> back<00:00:47.489> depending<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.360> your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this forward and back depending on your

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
this forward and back depending on your
hand<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.140> want<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
hand so if you want to have more of a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
hand so if you want to have more of a
flaw<00:00:50.700> type<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> approach<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
flaw type of approach you can do that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
flaw type of approach you can do that
and<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.610> again<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.110> ship<00:00:55.350> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and and again all we do is we ship with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
and and again all we do is we ship with
a<00:00:55.559> simple<00:00:55.920> allen<00:00:56.160> wrench<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> see

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a simple allen wrench and you can see

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
a simple allen wrench and you can see
this<00:00:57.510> screw<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.140> moving<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.770> happens<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this screw is moving what happens is it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
this screw is moving what happens is it
allows<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.420> piece<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> move<00:01:00.989> forward

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
allows this this piece to move forward

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
allows this this piece to move forward
and<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.250> i<00:01:02.399> look<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.850> top

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and back if i look at this top

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
and back if i look at this top
adjustment<00:01:04.049> again<00:01:04.799> I'll<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:04.979> my<00:01:05.220> little

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
adjustment again I'll use my little

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
adjustment again I'll use my little
allen<00:01:05.880> key<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:07.049> i<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.650> can

I'm<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.260> they'll

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
I'm not going to do it because they'll

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.770 
I'm not going to do it because they'll
make<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> little

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
make a little

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.750 
make a little
of<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.959> mess<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.200> Lisa<00:02:14.920> these<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.490> these<00:02:15.610> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
of a mess but Lisa these one of these is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.180 
of a mess but Lisa these one of these is
five<00:02:15.970> grams<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.480> get<00:02:16.630> six<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.959> them<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.319> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
five grams you get six of them and so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.650 
five grams you get six of them and so
you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.370> have<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.610> add<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.910> 30<00:02:19.209> grams<00:02:19.450> of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you can have it add up to 30 grams of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.350 
you can have it add up to 30 grams of
weight<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.990> then<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.459> USB<00:02:22.150> version

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
cool design but this is a I guess a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.930 
cool design but this is a I guess a
prototype<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> wireless<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.819> right

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
prototype of the wireless is that right

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.870 
prototype of the wireless is that right
that's<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.209> handmade<00:02:43.540> sample<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
that's a handmade sample and this the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's a handmade sample and this the
thing<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.420> cool<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.200> show

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
thing it's really cool is can you show

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.930 
thing it's really cool is can you show
where<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.040> sure<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.370> battery<00:02:48.610> coming

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
where is it you sure the battery coming

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.070 
where is it you sure the battery coming
out<00:02:49.060> store<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.200> battery<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.830> pops<00:02:51.070> out

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
out store so this battery just pops out

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.750 
out store so this battery just pops out
and<00:02:53.080> battery<00:02:53.739> compartment<00:02:54.160> pops<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.550> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
and battery compartment pops out and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
then down here is a second piece and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.660 
then down here is a second piece and
this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.680> where<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.010> store<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.340> extra

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
you would unscrew it and you can store

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.470 
you would unscrew it and you can store
the<00:03:21.160> weight<00:03:21.280> set<00:03:21.310> aren't<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> keep<00:03:22.329> it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
all together you don't have to worry

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.710 
all together you don't have to worry
about<00:03:24.430> losing<00:03:24.760> all<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> little<00:03:25.360> bits<00:03:25.480> and

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
about losing all the little bits and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.850 
about losing all the little bits and
bobs<00:03:25.870> right<00:03:26.290> we<00:03:26.470> also<00:03:26.620> include<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.430> 10<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
bobs right we also include a 10 and the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.280 
bobs right we also include a 10 and the
10<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.880> will<00:03:31.030> comes<00:03:31.239> with<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.230> this

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
10 is this will comes with this and this

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
10 is this will comes with this and this
is<00:03:32.440> what<00:03:32.590> would<00:03:32.680> come<00:03:32.799> with<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.090> rat<00:03:34.090> 9<00:03:34.269> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
is what would come with the rat 9 and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.850 
is what would come with the rat 9 and
you<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.870> there's<00:03:35.140> your<00:03:35.230> cylinder<00:03:35.739> that

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
you can see there's your cylinder that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.140 
you can see there's your cylinder that
would<00:03:35.950> hold<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.130> extra<00:03:36.430> weights<00:03:36.610> there's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
would hold the extra weights there's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.830 
would hold the extra weights there's
your<00:03:37.360> extra<00:03:38.519> palms<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.910> then<00:03:40.269> two<00:03:40.480> extra

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
your extra palms and then two extra

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.259 
your extra palms and then two extra
pinky<00:03:41.200> pieces<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.130> again<00:03:42.400> trying<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.940> keep<00:03:43.090> all

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
pinky pieces so again trying to keep all

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.180 
pinky pieces so again trying to keep all
the<00:03:43.390> pieces<00:03:43.600> together<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.560> idea<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
the pieces together the idea is that you

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.789 
the pieces together the idea is that you
make<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.730> fit<00:03:45.970> your<00:03:46.510> style<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.290> then

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
make it fit your style and then

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.560 
make it fit your style and then
obviously<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.820> probably<00:03:49.090> won't<00:03:49.239> do<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.329> lot<00:03:49.540> of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
obviously you probably won't do a lot of

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.270 
obviously you probably won't do a lot of
adjustments<00:03:49.930> afterwards<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.250> if

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
adjustments afterwards but you can if

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.550 
adjustments afterwards but you can if
you<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.790> do<00:03:52.000> fine<00:03:52.239> tuning<00:03:52.660> based<00:03:53.140> on<00:03:53.350> what

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
you can do fine tuning based on what

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.110 
you can do fine tuning based on what
your<00:03:53.739> needs<00:03:53.769> are<00:03:54.100> case<00:03:54.489> based<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:54.970> type<00:03:55.090> of

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
your needs are case based on the type of

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.370 
your needs are case based on the type of
game<00:03:55.299> that<00:03:55.359> you're<00:03:55.540> playing<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.959> got<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.290> and
