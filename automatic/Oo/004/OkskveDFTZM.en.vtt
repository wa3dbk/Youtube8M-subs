00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.549
 Hi, how come today I bring a video about 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.100
 from here the genius of the good web was born 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.629
 as you already know this program guesses you 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.510
 all the characters that you are 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.310
 thinking through questions 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.860
 suspicious and others not in this case 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 after almost 30 questions I guess 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.220
 that we were talking about Bryan Cranston 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.320
 which is the one that acts in malcom as hal and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.539
 also in the series of 'breaking bad' 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.590
 but well let's start again on 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.590
 test to see how 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.860
 I said no, but if it was good, it's already 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.900
 same 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.490
 let's think about some character that 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.550
 be quite complicated for example 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.930
 because it comes to mind 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.800
 well let's talk 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.020
 about something that everyone already 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.710
 know is an animated series called 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.840
 'sponge Bob' 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.519
 it is for my opinion it is something quite 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.130
 easy but we're also going to 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.900
 to put what would be in bob 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 sponja the character of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 of a squirrel that is called arenita that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.030
 is one that brings a helmet that lives below 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.310
 from the sea too 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.440
 and well here we start with the first 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.090
 I'm not going to start again 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.870
 because here he already tells me that I have 29 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.400
 questions 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.400
 28 questions yes no 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.880
 again his character does not fight 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 possibly she would be guessing 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.970
 who would have said goku but is not a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.970
 cartoon 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.030
 they are animals 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.030
 It was created by Disney 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.680
 use clothes like that 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.350
 live in the water like this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.450
 they're grumpy not possibly here anymore 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.170
 talk about other characters there that is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 so grumpy in the series but it's not a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 star those who have seen sponge and have 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.819
 to know why this is telling me 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.799
 good is not a star 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.069
 has yellow skin not 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.790
 Nor is it a girl because obviously if 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.019
 is a chronic clear squirrel of the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.819
 unique that appear there and I already 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.829
 I do not get the picture exactly but it says 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.860
 arenita cheeks called the 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.980
 character in the sponge series when 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.459
 I left it too easy, let's try 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.720
 with another with another character but this 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.400
 once we will use 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 of the series d 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.709
 of malcom we are going to use the character 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.170
 risk is the brother of evil with the series and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.810
 suddenly I have not seen the series ponle 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.580
 there in google malcom and then it puts you 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.100
 risk to see so you can see what the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.920
 character if it comes to me to guess 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.780
 and play again 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.319
 I believe that in Mexico the whole world 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.620
 knows malcom and therefore everyone 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.650
 knows harris that the seat of risk 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.800
 as his character is called he fights what 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.240
 is asking the same thing, why not 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.240
 it's a cartoon not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.590
 she is not a woman either 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.860
 the mother tongue is Spanish when not 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.860
 I know 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.370
 If you close to 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.730
 he is an actor yes 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.709
 and lives in the USA 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.709
 in a television series yes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.650
 has appeared in nickelodeon the truth not 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.379
 he 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.790
 it's related to Disney, I do not know either 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.000
 do not be ready for this kind of 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.000
 questions 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.020
 his character is physically attractive 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.020
 do not 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.570
 I would not answer that 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.570
 he is an adult man 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.250
 yes 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.740
 appeared in the series of the theory of 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.740
 big band 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.960
 is famous for his clumsiness and she is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.960
 arriving usually avoid talking 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.040
 is currently over 50 years old no no 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.529
 of black skin does not either 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.790
 is more than 40 years old 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:52.400
 in disney I do not know 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.400
 act act on spider-man 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:02.130
 is a member of the boss ron drive challenge 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.130
 obviously not there we go for the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.130
 ask 22 concerts 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.080
 appears 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.200
 of nickelodeon 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.770
 acted with a green mask 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.770
 do not 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.570
 and good, unfortunately, this time I did not 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.570
 has achieved 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.730
 get to the result that would come 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.310
 rys the one of malcolm that I put them right now 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.170
 the image on the screen but good 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.420
 anyway, it's a program 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.390
 pretty funny guessing almost 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.520
 any animated character especially 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.870
 animated characters because characters in 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.310
 real life if it's a little more complicated 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.830
 but he's also going to ask you some 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.260
 things of the series for example 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.180
 I do not know who created it and so on and sometimes 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.620
 Well, you have no idea what I think is good 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.690
 and finally we are going to make a character 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.690
 pretty simple for them to see the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.970
 speed with which possibly or not 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.580
 I guarantee nothing but possibly you 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.580
 he will solve it quickly 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.550
 I believe that everyone knows the 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.660
 famous goku 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.660
 let's play again 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:39.840
 and he's good at fighting 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.840
 appears in dragon ball 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.870
 is the main voice of the group oh yes 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.870
 well it's not cruel that I know 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.450
 it was resurrected from death yes 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.280
 this is something 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.669
 with barely knowing how to let me tell them 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.970
 as with seven questions more or less no 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.470
 with eight questions and then good until 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.360
 here the video I hope you have them 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.940
 liked and that served them I leave you 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.940
 the link in the description in case of 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.540
 they suddenly want to scare their children 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:31.370
 small and others with this application 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.370
 and it 's good until the next
