00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.460
 it's the end of one of the most concerts 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.900
 expected of the year 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.900
 madonna in chile 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 I invested 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.580
 We learned the hoarse for a minimum show 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.590
 cache no no no no no tell me frame is the 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.240
 indignation of the fans the recital 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.730
 started more than two hours late 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.010
 but the pop diva ended up with 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.670
 punctuality a contrast that left with 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.680
 little taste 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.410
 there are those who waited in the rain in 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.260
 the national stadium lousy bad one 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.879
 part respect an hour and a half waiting for 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.470
 the promissory notes so that both tranches 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.320
 of the hour these three as singles 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.150
 ourselves from puerto montt traveling 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.269
 since the morning we arrived here at 4 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.269
 the afternoon 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.570
 50,000 tickets were sold from the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.240
 27 thousand to 300 thousand pesos but according to 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.059
 carabineros only 36 thousand people saw 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.340
 the show at the entrance were fixed 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.770
 20 hours as the show started then 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.080
 production delayed it to 21 to 30 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.930
 but the artist finally came out close 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.729
 from midnight had previously been 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.840
 assured that the weather conditions 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 they would not be problems 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.030
 only rain has been touched on others 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.609
 places and that has never been a problem 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.259
 for us the assistants assure 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.229
 that they did not receive any explanation 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.490
 for the delay and the briefness of the show that 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.049
 We watched on YouTube what the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 presentation in another country he skipped everything 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.890
 that everything spectacular that others 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.530
 point to the company in charge of the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.689
 production time for I do not have thought 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.000
 go see her the actions that can be 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.619
 to exercise against the company I believe 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.979
 what a minimum should last give us the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.360
 half of the pop return for health 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.220
 Well, come on, it 's all sick tomorrow 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 during the concert the producer 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.599
 attributed the difficulties to the rain 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 but it is co that the recital was made to 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.700
 despite all this Thursday the company 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.890
 declined to refer to the sernac issue in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.110
 both reminded users to save their 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.269
 tickets if you offer it an artist 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 you have to have the artist that 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.180
 promising if you were offered 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.980
 certain conditions such as the duration of 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.299
 an event they have to respect him and I 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.400
 I know they want to hear answers 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.870
 definitive but it is a stage this 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.769
 happened a few hours ago then it's a 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.349
 stage in which we are still 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.390
 evaluating how we are going to continue the end 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.740
 of a megaconcert 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 waters and hoods look how I am 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.360
 type say I do it if I could I do it and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.520
 What we win 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.820
 but he still had mortal despite everything 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.820
