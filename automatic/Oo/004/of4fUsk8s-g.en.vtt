00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.850
 One complete mother of image 1 already three Asamura 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.640
 I have processed a bat but 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.150
 At this point 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:19.590
 I Nja have come up with a practice as friendly play 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:23.570
 But when this moves in the second half to a somewhat difficult place, the reaction is probably processed three more 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.570
 I think I will respond well 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.150
 Ur was made and Matsui Masao enters 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.670
 Hit the ball and say to the light Guard Work Lautra Light Bar 2 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.660
 It was- 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 Mitsuo Matsui is home run from the shore 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.210
 14 runs to the light that caught the first ball 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.360
 Probably it was not a change Jap ジ ャ 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.360
 It is 34 km 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.409
 I 'm a veteran of Mercy shoes 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.360
 It was a hit of entering the moment 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 Hera nao nao 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.500
 I do not know the contribution of the stadium, but this Matsui-style person liger of the sky 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.500
 It may be the first time this season was a season ago 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.620
 Home run appeared in two tables of this Matsui Masao This is the first of this season 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.620
 Let's take a look 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.590
 It is a little slide rotation, is n't it? 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.060
 Well with the slider and the euro 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.060
 It was a ball when it was close, but it was a small change, but I caught it well- 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.090
 It is Matsui image that is now the 180th home run of professional total
