00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
through updating security onion using

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.839 
through updating security onion using
our<00:00:08.280> built<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:09.200> update<00:00:10.200> script<00:00:10.559> called<00:00:11.130> soup

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
our built in update script called soup

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
our built in update script called soup
so<00:00:12.809> we're<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> go<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.500> terminal

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
so we're just going to go to a terminal

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.320 
so we're just going to go to a terminal
and<00:00:14.240> we're<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> run<00:00:15.630> sudo<00:00:16.109> soup<00:00:17.210> put<00:00:18.210> in

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and we're going to run sudo soup put in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
and we're going to run sudo soup put in
our<00:00:18.449> password<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.220> it<00:00:20.220> says<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> script<00:00:20.820> will

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
our password and it says the script will

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.220 
our password and it says the script will
automatically<00:00:21.510> install<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:22.199> available

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
automatically install all available

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230 
automatically install all available
updates<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> handle<00:00:25.560> some

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
like my sequel server and PF ring and so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
like my sequel server and PF ring and so
that's<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.140> soup<00:00:34.649> update<00:00:35.100> script

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that's where this soup update script

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000 
that's where this soup update script
came<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.320> press<00:00:37.530> ENTER<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
came from so we just press ENTER and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.400 
came from so we just press ENTER and
it's<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> sudo<00:00:39.300> apt-get<00:00:39.750> update<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it's going to do sudo apt-get update and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.240 
it's going to do sudo apt-get update and
then<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.590> make<00:00:43.590> sure<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.070> all

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
then it's going to make sure that all

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
then it's going to make sure that all
the<00:00:44.430> packages<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:45.030> installed<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.690> proper

the packages are installed in the proper

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.619 
the packages are installed in the proper
order<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.030> any<00:00:48.210> issues

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
order so that we don't have any issues

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.490 
order so that we don't have any issues
with<00:00:48.870> updates<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.360> gone<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:52.020> doing

of those pieces of software we then

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609

in<00:01:41.880> our<00:01:42.479> own<00:01:42.509> PPA<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> use

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in our own PPA so this way we can use

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.859 
in our own PPA so this way we can use
all<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> standard<00:01:46.170> Ubuntu<00:01:46.860> tools<00:01:47.869> for

all the standard Ubuntu tools for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
all the standard Ubuntu tools for
updating<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.549> apt-get<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.920> only

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
updating so we can use apt-get the only

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.760 
updating so we can use apt-get the only
issue<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.570> mentioned<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.619> do

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
issue is as I mentioned before we do

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.440 
issue is as I mentioned before we do
have<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.040> careful<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.670> sequel<00:01:57.240> server

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
have to be careful with my sequel server

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.200 
have to be careful with my sequel server
and<00:01:57.840> PF<00:01:58.290> ring<00:01:58.530> updates<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.850> where<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and PF ring updates so that's where this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
and PF ring updates so that's where this
soup<00:02:00.719> script<00:02:01.140> comes<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.860> few

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
soup script comes in so in just a few

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.520 
soup script comes in so in just a few
minutes<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.490> should<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.820> done<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.780> of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
minutes it should be done with all of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.219 
minutes it should be done with all of
these<00:02:07.649> updates<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.479> because<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.660> did<00:02:09.840> install

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
these updates and because it did install

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.040 
these updates and because it did install
a<00:02:10.259> new<00:02:10.470> kernel<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.039> will<00:02:11.310> prompt<00:02:12.120> us<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
a new kernel it will prompt us to

and<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.570> it's<00:02:45.690> running<00:02:46.020> DKMS

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and you can see there it's running DKMS

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.090 
and you can see there it's running DKMS
DKMS<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.120> an<00:02:48.360> automatic<00:02:49.110> build<00:02:49.350> system<00:02:49.860> for

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
DKMS is a an automatic build system for

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.200 
DKMS is a an automatic build system for
kernel<00:02:50.460> modules<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:52.020> enables<00:02:52.620> us<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.210> push

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
kernel modules that enables us to push

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.590 
kernel modules that enables us to push
the<00:02:54.240> PF<00:02:54.990> ring<00:02:55.290> source<00:02:55.680> code<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> kernel

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
the PF ring source code for the kernel

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.730 
the PF ring source code for the kernel
module<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.400> be<00:03:00.120> built<00:03:00.600> every<00:03:01.500> time<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
module and have it be built every time a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.330 
module and have it be built every time a
new<00:03:01.890> kernel<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.610> installed<00:03:03.530> automatically<00:03:04.530> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
new kernel is installed automatically so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.240 
new kernel is installed automatically so
that<00:03:05.370> way<00:03:05.610> we<00:03:05.790> don't<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.300> push<00:03:07.250> compiled

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that way we don't have to push compiled

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.870 
that way we don't have to push compiled
versions<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.330> kernel<00:03:10.230> modules<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.730> just

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
versions of kernel modules we can just

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
versions of kernel modules we can just
push<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.270> source<00:03:12.540> package<00:03:13.020> for<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> PF<00:03:13.830> ring

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
push the source package for the PF ring

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.280 
push the source package for the PF ring
module<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:15.180> whenever<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.840> update<00:03:15.990> your

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
module and then whenever you update your

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.460 
module and then whenever you update your
kernel<00:03:16.710> your<00:03:17.550> box<00:03:17.850> then<00:03:18.210> locally<00:03:18.900> builds<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
kernel your box then locally builds that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:30.650 
kernel your box then locally builds that
kernel<00:03:19.860> module<00:03:28.670> okay<00:03:29.670> all<00:03:29.910> updates<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.630> been

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
kernel module okay all updates have been

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.940 
kernel module okay all updates have been
installed<00:03:31.140> press<00:03:31.920> ENTER<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.520> reboot<00:03:35.330> and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
installed press ENTER to reboot and

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.470 
installed press ENTER to reboot and
that's<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.100> there<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.240> you<00:03:39.330> just

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that's all there is to it so you just

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720 
that's all there is to it so you just
pop<00:03:39.780> open<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.170> terminal<00:03:40.290> window<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.830> type<00:03:41.190> sudo

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
pop open a terminal window you type sudo

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.060 
pop open a terminal window you type sudo
soup<00:03:42.480> enter<00:03:43.470> your<00:03:43.620> sudo<00:03:43.980> password<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:46.070> the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
soup enter your sudo password and the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.270 
soup enter your sudo password and the
soup<00:03:47.340> script<00:03:47.760> takes<00:03:48.150> care<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.660> rest<00:03:49.280> so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
soup script takes care of the rest so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.520 
soup script takes care of the rest so
now<00:03:50.400> we've<00:03:50.580> rebooted<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:52.110> soon<00:03:52.290> as<00:03:52.410> the

now we've rebooted and as soon as the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
now we've rebooted and as soon as the
login<00:03:52.890> screen<00:03:53.010> appears<00:03:53.190> we'll<00:03:53.790> log<00:03:53.970> back<00:03:54.210> in

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
login screen appears we'll log back in

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.990 
login screen appears we'll log back in
