00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
anything to lose by bringing in Michael

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
anything to lose by bringing in Michael
Beasley<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:51.420> his<00:00:51.570> best<00:00:51.780> season

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Beasley I think he had his best season

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.080 
Beasley I think he had his best season
three<00:00:52.410> years<00:00:52.620> ago<00:00:52.890> where<00:00:53.039> he<00:00:53.070> scored<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.640> 19

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
three years ago where he scored about 19

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.279 
three years ago where he scored about 19
points<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> Minnesota<00:00:54.989> Timberwolves

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
points for the Minnesota Timberwolves

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.490 
points for the Minnesota Timberwolves
and<00:00:55.860> since<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.850> has<00:00:57.030> basically<00:00:57.600> sucked

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and since then he has basically sucked

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
and since then he has basically sucked
he<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.190> supposed<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
he was supposed to be kind of the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
he was supposed to be kind of the
cornerstone<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> Phoenix<00:01:02.100> Suns<00:01:02.250> were

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
cornerstone that the Phoenix Suns were

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
cornerstone that the Phoenix Suns were
gonna<00:01:02.640> build<00:01:02.910> around<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.899> he

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gonna build around but we all know he

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
gonna build around but we all know he
loves<00:01:04.409> smoking<00:01:05.280> weed<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.000> he<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.360> released

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
loves smoking weed and he got released

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.020 
loves smoking weed and he got released
and<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.010> bought<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.700> still

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and by the way he got bought out I still

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
and by the way he got bought out I still
think<00:01:09.060> he's<00:01:09.420> gonna<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.780> 9<00:01:10.049> million<00:01:10.320> dollars

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
think he's gonna get 9 million dollars

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.399 
think he's gonna get 9 million dollars
and<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.520> he<00:01:12.090> sticks<00:01:12.420> around<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> miami

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and if he sticks around with the miami

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
and if he sticks around with the miami
heat<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.640> an<00:01:14.790> extra<00:01:15.570> weapon<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.170> guy

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
heat that is just an extra weapon a guy

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.280 
heat that is just an extra weapon a guy
who<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.830> score<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.549> makes<00:01:17.820> no<00:01:18.090> sense<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.960> he

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
who can score that makes no sense if he

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
who can score that makes no sense if he
lays<00:01:19.530> off<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> weed<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> actually<00:01:21.060> wants
