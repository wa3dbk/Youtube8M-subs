that<00:01:04.890> killed<00:01:05.280> us<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.820> felt<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.900> panicked<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that killed us I felt like we panicked a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
that killed us I felt like we panicked a
little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.880> maybe<00:01:09.240> certain<00:01:09.630> guys

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
little bit because maybe certain guys

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
little bit because maybe certain guys
that<00:01:10.049> had<00:01:10.170> been<00:01:10.890> shooting<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.490> didn't<00:01:11.790> get

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that had been shooting a well didn't get

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
that had been shooting a well didn't get
shots<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.570> thought<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> did<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.260> job<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
shots I thought they did a good job of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.330 
shots I thought they did a good job of
taking<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.159> away<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
taking that away but I don't know you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999 
taking that away but I don't know you
know<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> changing<00:01:18.119> defenses<00:01:18.780> didn't<00:01:19.080> really

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
know the changing defenses didn't really

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.149 
know the changing defenses didn't really
bother<00:01:20.189> us<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.759> mean<00:01:21.320> team<00:01:22.320> presses<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.950> can't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bother us I mean team presses you can't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
bother us I mean team presses you can't
take<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> ball<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> say<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> throw

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
take the ball out and say here and throw

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
take the ball out and say here and throw
it<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.470> mean<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it to them I mean that's it's kind of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.700 
it to them I mean that's it's kind of
ridiculous<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.259> caught<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.590> when

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
ridiculous so I think it caught up when

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.140 
ridiculous so I think it caught up when
it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.340> we're<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.670> real<00:01:32.880> deep

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's a little bit we're not real deep

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.280 
it's a little bit we're not real deep
and<00:01:33.329> talent<00:01:34.009> but<00:01:35.009> we'll<00:01:35.250> we'll<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.630> will

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and talent but we'll we'll get more will

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530 
and talent but we'll we'll get more will
be<00:01:37.320> better<00:01:37.619> we've<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> hell<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.180> week<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

some<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> mean<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.399> heart<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
some but I mean in the in the heart of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
some but I mean in the in the heart of
it<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> 12<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.570> 16<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.380> half<00:01:57.229> we're

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it the 12 for 16 in the first half we're

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
it the 12 for 16 in the first half we're
just<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.590> deep<00:01:58.890> enough<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.460> talent<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> we

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
just not deep enough with talent that we

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
just not deep enough with talent that we
could<00:02:00.420> overcome<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.219> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
could overcome that and I don't know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
could overcome that and I don't know
what<00:02:02.640> made<00:02:02.850> us<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.719> Travis<00:02:04.140> spent<00:02:04.320> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
what made us you know Travis spent so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
what made us you know Travis spent so
good<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.979> year<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.430> he<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.820> being

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
good all year I think he was being

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
good all year I think he was being
modest<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.899> did<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.950> played<00:02:08.190> very

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
modest I I did not think we played very

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.260 
modest I I did not think we played very
well

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
well

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330 
well
