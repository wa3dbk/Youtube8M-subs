00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.800 
that stuff on there it's on my back I
can't<00:01:57.140> reach<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.490> quickly<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.210> don't<00:01:59.600> really

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
can't reach it quickly so I don't really

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.029 
can't reach it quickly so I don't really
want<00:02:00.020> any<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.289> stuff<00:02:00.500> on<00:02:00.649> there<00:02:00.799> because<00:02:00.950> I'm

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
probably going to use it mainly while

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.020 
probably going to use it mainly while

hiking or are bicycling or something

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.090 
hiking or are bicycling or something
like<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.539> first-aid<00:02:05.990> kit<00:02:06.100> will

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
like that so a first-aid kit will

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.529 
like that so a first-aid kit will
probably<00:02:07.460> that's<00:02:07.909> kinetically<00:02:08.270> going<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> be

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
probably that's kinetically going to be

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.340 
probably that's kinetically going to be
used<00:02:08.750> probably<00:02:09.229> more<00:02:09.560> often<00:02:10.039> than<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:11.320> pistol

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350

there's<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.200> there's<00:03:25.290> nothing<00:03:25.620> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
there's and there's nothing that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.990 
there's and there's nothing that
actually<00:03:25.830> holds<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.459> bladder

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
actually holds the bladder

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.470 
actually holds the bladder
up<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.050> system<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.130> once<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.580> are<00:03:29.880> up<00:03:30.300> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
up in the system so once you are up and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.960 
up in the system so once you are up and
about<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.959> bladder<00:03:31.170> falls<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.830> bottom

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
about the bladder falls to the bottom

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.150 
about the bladder falls to the bottom
well<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.330> don't<00:03:34.260> think<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.440> looked<00:03:34.740> into<00:03:35.010> what

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
well I don't think that looked into what

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.180 
well I don't think that looked into what
they<00:03:35.280> had<00:03:35.459> closely<00:03:35.940> enough<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.950> problem

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
they had closely enough is not a problem

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.550 
they had closely enough is not a problem
as<00:03:38.340> soon<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.640> looked<00:03:38.880> at<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.110> on<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> inside

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
as soon as I looked at it on the inside

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.630 
as soon as I looked at it on the inside
there's<00:03:40.800> two<00:03:41.010> little<00:03:41.300> velcro<00:03:43.130> tabs<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.489> you

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
there's two little velcro tabs that you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.090 
there's two little velcro tabs that you
can<00:03:44.910> actually<00:03:45.060> connect<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.410> idea<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
can actually connect and the idea that I

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.060 
can actually connect and the idea that I
actually<00:03:47.489> ran<00:03:48.060> them<00:03:48.270> through<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.600> top<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
actually ran them through the top of the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.610 
actually ran them through the top of the
book<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.840> part<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.080> screw<00:03:52.290> into<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
book of the part that you screw into the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.900 
book of the part that you screw into the
bladder<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.250> ran<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.459> through<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.670> top<00:03:53.880> of

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
bladder I just ran it through the top of

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.160 
bladder I just ran it through the top of
there<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.420> holds<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> bladder<00:03:55.080> just

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
there and it holds up the bladder just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.380 
there and it holds up the bladder just
fine<00:03:55.560> there<00:03:56.160> doesn't<00:03:56.459> affect<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> 2.5<00:03:57.330> liter

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
fine there doesn't affect the 2.5 liter

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.870 
fine there doesn't affect the 2.5 liter
capacity<00:03:57.780> at<00:03:58.320> all

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
capacity at all

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.220 
capacity at all
another<00:03:59.880> issue<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.570> people<00:04:01.170> were

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
another issue that people were

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.460 
another issue that people were
complaining<00:04:01.560> about<00:04:02.840> from<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.140> me<00:04:04.260> just

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
complaining about from for me just

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.880 
complaining about from for me just
looking<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.830> website<00:04:05.040> was<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.150> uh<00:04:06.890> once

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
looking on the website was that uh once

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.620 
looking on the website was that uh once
you<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.310> straw<00:04:08.610> out<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:09.090> straw<00:04:09.270> portion

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
you have the straw out of straw portion

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.510 
you have the straw out of straw portion
out<00:04:09.750> there's<00:04:10.230> nothing<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.830> hold<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.370> place

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
out there's nothing to hold it in place

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.540 
out there's nothing to hold it in place
so<00:04:11.870> it'll<00:04:12.870> just<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:13.170> flopping<00:04:13.709> around<00:04:13.800> you

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
so it'll just be flopping around you

so it'll just be flopping around you

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
on the other side of the escalator I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.250 
on the other side of the escalator I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.590 
just clipped the end of the of the straw
portions<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.580> now<00:04:40.970> it's<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> fully

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
portions so now it's like a fully

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.770 
portions so now it's like a fully
self-contained<00:04:42.310> system<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.030> all<00:04:44.420> I<00:04:44.450> did<00:04:44.660> was

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
self-contained system and all I did was

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.770 
self-contained system and all I did was
have<00:04:44.930> one<00:04:45.290> clip<00:04:45.940> it's<00:04:46.940> like<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.090> three<00:04:47.300> dollar<00:04:47.450> s

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
have one clip it's like a three dollar s

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.710 
have one clip it's like a three dollar s
clip<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:49.160> isn't<00:04:49.340> gonna<00:04:49.580> go<00:04:49.790> flying<00:04:50.060> all

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
clip so this isn't gonna go flying all

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.090 
clip so this isn't gonna go flying all
over<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:51.200> place<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.650> not<00:04:51.740> going<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:51.950> be<00:04:52.010> as

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
over the place it's not going to be as

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.590 
over the place it's not going to be as
tightly<00:04:52.400> as<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.820> would<00:04:52.940> with<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.150> camel<00:04:53.480> back

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
tightly as it would with a camel back

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.400 
tightly as it would with a camel back
because<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.840> runs<00:04:54.140> through<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.380> whole

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
because that runs through the whole

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.430 
because that runs through the whole
