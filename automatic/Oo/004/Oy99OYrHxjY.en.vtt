00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
without you know in color scheme you

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.290 
without you know in color scheme you
want<00:07:11.580> to<00:07:11.730> do<00:07:11.880> but<00:07:12.510> um<00:07:12.720> a<00:07:13.130> lot<00:07:14.130> of<00:07:14.220> fun<00:07:14.430> to<00:07:14.550> do<00:07:14.760> and

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
want to do but um a lot of fun to do and

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.000 
want to do but um a lot of fun to do and
I<00:07:15.420> you<00:07:15.480> know<00:07:15.780> usually<00:07:16.290> what<00:07:16.380> I'll<00:07:16.530> do<00:07:16.710> is<00:07:16.860> get

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
I you know usually what I'll do is get

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.490 
I you know usually what I'll do is get
assembly<00:07:17.520> line<00:07:17.700> so<00:07:17.940> I'll<00:07:18.090> get<00:07:18.270> you<00:07:18.420> know<00:07:18.570> bunch

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
assembly line so I'll get you know bunch

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.160 
assembly line so I'll get you know bunch
of<00:07:19.620> poppers<00:07:20.070> paint<00:07:20.430> them<00:07:20.610> that<00:07:21.510> first<00:07:21.810> glue

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
of poppers paint them that first glue

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.380 
of poppers paint them that first glue
and<00:07:22.440> of<00:07:22.500> course<00:07:22.770> and<00:07:23.070> then<00:07:23.490> paint<00:07:24.060> them<00:07:24.180> and

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
and of course and then paint them and

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.800 
and of course and then paint them and
then<00:07:24.840> you<00:07:25.590> know<00:07:25.770> then<00:07:26.520> just<00:07:26.760> you<00:07:27.450> know<00:07:27.480> once

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
then you know then just you know once

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.540 
then you know then just you know once
you're<00:07:27.990> done<00:07:28.110> paint<00:07:28.500> them<00:07:28.680> all<00:07:28.830> and<00:07:29.160> do<00:07:29.370> them

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
you're done paint them all and do them

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.130 
you're done paint them all and do them
in<00:07:29.580> your<00:07:29.730> different<00:07:30.090> stage<00:07:30.390> just<00:07:30.540> like<00:07:30.660> we<00:07:30.930> did

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
in your different stage just like we did

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.090 
in your different stage just like we did
and<00:07:31.380> they're<00:07:31.530> just<00:07:31.740> going<00:07:32.280> in<00:07:32.520> Thai<00:07:32.730> bunch

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
and they're just going in Thai bunch

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.190 
and they're just going in Thai bunch
instead<00:07:35.100> of<00:07:35.220> just<00:07:35.370> doing<00:07:35.520> one<00:07:35.880> at<00:07:36.030> a<00:07:36.060> time<00:07:36.300> get

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.200 
instead of just doing one at a time get

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.280 
instead of just doing one at a time get
them<00:07:37.260> done<00:07:37.470> quicker<00:07:37.800> like<00:07:38.040> that
