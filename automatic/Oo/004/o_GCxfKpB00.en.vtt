00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the other day and I was sitting on my

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
the other day and I was sitting on my
bed<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.830> thought<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.400> maybe

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
bed and I just thought like of maybe

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
bed and I just thought like of maybe
yelling<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.449> no<00:00:30.480> reason<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
yelling for no reason just like in the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
yelling for no reason just like in the
hopes<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.009> somebody<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.940> maybe<00:00:33.120> yell

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
hopes that somebody would maybe yell

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
hopes that somebody would maybe yell
back<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.690> me<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.130> just
