00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
to get the painting spring for your

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.259 
to get the painting spring for your
garage<00:00:07.230> door<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.730> order<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
garage door and have that order the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.540 
garage door and have that order the
right<00:00:09.450> thing<00:00:09.750> first<00:00:10.650> thing<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.980> need<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.160> find

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
right thing first thing we need to find

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.270 
right thing first thing we need to find
out<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.179> inside<00:00:12.809> spring<00:00:13.200> diameter<00:00:13.860> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
out is the inside spring diameter we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
out is the inside spring diameter we
also<00:00:14.460> need<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.210> wire<00:00:15.450> diameter<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
also need to know the wire diameter and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.279 
also need to know the wire diameter and
the<00:00:16.830> overall<00:00:17.130> spring<00:00:17.609> length<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.960> we're

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the overall spring length so first we're

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
the overall spring length so first we're
going<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> find<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.460> inside<00:00:20.939> fire

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
going to find out what your inside fire

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.410 
going to find out what your inside fire
diamonds<00:00:22.460> usually<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.880> found<00:00:24.090> on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
diamonds usually that can be found on

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.759 
diamonds usually that can be found on
the<00:00:24.630> comb<00:00:25.369> right<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> base<00:00:27.410> on<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the comb right here at the base on this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
the comb right here at the base on this
one<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.340> say<00:00:29.720> 2.00<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:31.679> say<00:00:32.540> 1.75

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
one it will say 2.00 we will say 1.75

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.709 
one it will say 2.00 we will say 1.75
something<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:35.149> right<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
something like that right here this is a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.040 
something like that right here this is a
2-inch<00:00:37.200> diameter<00:00:37.469> spring<00:00:38.629> next<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.780> need<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
2-inch diameter spring next we need to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.030 
2-inch diameter spring next we need to
find<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.379> -<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> wire<00:00:40.829> diameter<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:43.040> what

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
find out - a wire diameter so what

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.110 
find out - a wire diameter so what
you're<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> you're<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.380 
you're going to do is you're going to
channel<00:00:45.379> 20<00:00:46.379> coils<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.910> take<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
channel 20 coils and then take that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.069 
channel 20 coils and then take that
measurement<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> take<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> 24

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
measurement so when you take the 24

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
measurement so when you take the 24
measurement<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> divide<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.239> pick

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
measurement then you divide it you pick

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
measurement then you divide it you pick
whatever<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> inch<00:00:55.770> measurement<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.520> divide

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
whatever the inch measurement and divide

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
whatever the inch measurement and divide
about<00:00:57.059> winning<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.000> case<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
about winning so in this case this is a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.969 
about winning so in this case this is a
243<00:01:02.000> wire<00:01:03.000> diameter<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.260> need<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> write

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
243 wire diameter so we need to write

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
243 wire diameter so we need to write
that<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.090> also<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.200> overall

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that down and then also the overall

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.210 
that down and then also the overall
spring<00:01:08.159> length<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:09.689> need<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
spring length is we need to know all the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.490 
spring length is we need to know all the
back<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.360> case<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.080> four<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
back so in this case it's four and a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880 
back so in this case it's four and a
half<00:01:13.560> inches<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.460> rope<00:01:14.760> piece<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.890> then

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
half inches on this rope piece and then

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.719 
half inches on this rope piece and then
where<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:18.229> eighteen<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> half<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.490> need

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
where I eighteen and a half so we need

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.649 
where I eighteen and a half so we need
to<00:01:20.820> write<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> down

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to write that down

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.990 
to write that down
that's<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.259> spring<00:01:22.530> size<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.729> water

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that's the spring size for me the water

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's the spring size for me the water
off<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> website

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.780 

to<00:01:40.479> determine<00:01:41.200> if<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.830> have<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.010> left<00:01:42.370> hand<00:01:42.670> in

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
to determine if you have a left hand in

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.140 
to determine if you have a left hand in
life<00:01:43.000> right<00:01:43.479> in<00:01:43.720> line<00:01:43.990> spring<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.760> go<00:01:45.970> by

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
life right in line spring you can go by

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.590 
life right in line spring you can go by
the<00:01:46.210> paint<00:01:46.600> color<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.710> paint<00:01:48.010> color<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:49.210> black
