00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
games don't really work on this so I'm

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.780

as<00:02:16.090> you'd<00:02:17.019> really<00:02:17.380> expect<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.519> I'm<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.880> to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
as you'd really expect so I'm going to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.640 
as you'd really expect so I'm going to
try<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.060> hit<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.299> ball<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:20.560> going

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
try and hit the ball and it's not going

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.320 
try and hit the ball and it's not going
to<00:02:20.739> do<00:02:20.860> anything<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.489> kind<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.790> moving<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
to do anything it's kind of moving it I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.080 
to do anything it's kind of moving it I
hold<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.230> kind<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.980> holds<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.549> page<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.060> well

hold it kind of holds the page as well

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.150 
hold it kind of holds the page as well
this<00:02:25.840> or<00:02:26.019> moves<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.380> around<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:26.859> doesn't

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
this or moves it around so it doesn't

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.699 
this or moves it around so it doesn't
really<00:02:27.400> well<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.030> don't<00:02:28.209> expect<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.570> play

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709

lot of them require a keyboard anyway so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.770 
lot of them require a keyboard anyway so
we'll<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.970> spending<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.269> just<00:02:34.450> trying<00:02:34.600> hit<00:02:34.720> the

then<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.930> lost<00:02:38.049> because<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.410> couldn't<00:02:38.680> move<00:02:38.799> it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
then I lost because I couldn't move it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.170 
then I lost because I couldn't move it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.910 
around because it's moving the web page
around<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.170> pretty<00:02:41.380> much<00:02:41.500> covers<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
around so that pretty much covers it
