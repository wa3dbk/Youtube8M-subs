00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello everyone in this house we work with 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.910
 drywall on the ground floor did 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 ceilings well there are a few shapes yet 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.539
 customers are good people and I know them 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.480
 long been asked to see how it was 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 attic made 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.250
 here guys when last year of business and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:39.440
 plaster on the ceiling on the walls only 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.860
 which of course surprised that you are our metal 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.129
 I did not apply here I unscrewed 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 sheets of metal across the sheet goes 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.989
 here in 40 centimeters for metal seam 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 for some reason maybe it was not enough 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.890
 forgot may new technology night and its 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.890
 There is no therefore under pressure 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:26.930
 our ceiling and walks dancing the same way 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:31.090
 the most that concerns with whom we unscrewed 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:36.470
 here is this piece 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.890
 basically it did not have to 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.890
 screw in to make sure that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 metal 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:12.850
 Minvat Minwatu between metal is not here they 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:12.850
 I will describe the motik in two layers of gypsum 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.220
 your shower 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:31.150
 will be laid on the floor tiles on the walls 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:34.680
 also tile and basically the same 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.680
 the problem is no metal 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:55.270
 corners are bolted too 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:59.100
 very bad have to serve them out 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.100
 there is no metal either 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.000
 so screws 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:18.040
 stingy just watched it 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.060
 30 centimeters here here 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 twisted on top shutter speed in principle 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.040
 no screws are twisted 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:41.090
 Here is such a story prikolchik 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:43.880
 happened to the tenants of this house there 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.530
 proverb fku understand understand strokes twice but these 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.069
 people are generous enough 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.720
 very nice people just got caught 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.260
 whom they trusted 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.260
 but not received 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.820
 quality work will earn 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.820
 it was naturally paid 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:21.959
 the only thing that pleased me so 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.960
 how did the hosts take care to 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.120
 to desatisfy 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.890
 warm your attic 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 this polystyrene came two people or 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.520
 three knives don't know exactly how many there were and 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:46.940
 two days blew the whole roof 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:53.700
 inside up to 15 centimeters 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:58.919
 polystyrene plus above the ceiling mineral wool 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.440
 all is well obesum pours these 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:12.230
 the rooms during the heavy rain I 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:12.230
 three- pane windows climbed here 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.800
 This is of course great and not 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 worried 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:54.710
 during the autumn breakthrough will 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:54.710
 Enough for the classroom spring 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:15.440
 these are the situations I wish you 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:23.840
 so that everything happens for good without 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:23.840
 dirty tricks of all good bye
