00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.909 
disappointed and I'd be shocked if all
of<00:00:27.239> us<00:00:27.450> don't<00:00:27.960> feel<00:00:28.290> that<00:00:28.500> sense<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
of us don't feel that sense of

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.400 
of us don't feel that sense of
disappointment<00:00:29.779> but<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.930> shouldn't<00:00:31.169> be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
disappointment but we shouldn't be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
disappointment but we shouldn't be
disheartened<00:00:32.090> we're<00:00:33.090> winning<00:00:33.390> team<00:00:33.630> we're

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
used to being at the front and in these

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.500 
used to being at the front and in these
sorts<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> conditions<00:00:37.470> then<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.520> fight<00:00:39.120> even

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
sorts of conditions then we fight even

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.830 
sorts of conditions then we fight even
harder<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:40.410> strive<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.740> be<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.220> front<00:00:41.430> and

harder we strive to be at the front and
that's<00:00:42.840> exactly<00:00:43.050> what<00:00:43.830> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.130> been<00:00:44.340> doing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

that's exactly what we have been doing
and<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.020> doing

and that's what we are going to be doing

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
and that's what we are going to be doing
we<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.920> knew<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.940> were<00:00:48.030> coming<00:00:48.060> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
we all knew that we were coming to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.020 
we all knew that we were coming to
Barcelona<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.290> very<00:00:49.680> challenging<00:00:49.890> circuit<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
Barcelona a very challenging circuit and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.140 
Barcelona a very challenging circuit and
one<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.990> was<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.890> pick<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.940> on

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
one that was really going to pick up on

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.850 
one that was really going to pick up on
the<00:00:54.480> weaknesses<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.990> we<00:00:55.200> currently<00:00:55.380> have<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the weaknesses that we currently have in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.360 
the weaknesses that we currently have in
the<00:00:56.010> car<00:00:56.540> it's<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.690> circuit<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.440> only<00:00:58.950> two

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the car it's a circuit where only two

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
the car it's a circuit where only two
months<00:00:59.610> ago<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.660> were<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> half

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
months ago we were two and a half

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.069 
months ago we were two and a half
seconds<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> pace<00:01:02.630> two<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:03.810> a<00:01:03.840> half

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
seconds off the pace two and a half

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.249 
seconds off the pace two and a half
seconds<00:01:04.829> that<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.670> mile<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.509> Formula<00:01:07.079> One

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
seconds that is a mile in Formula One

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.160 
seconds that is a mile in Formula One
and<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:08.280> had<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.820> huge<00:01:09.450> shock<00:01:09.720> through<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and we had a huge shock through this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.010 
and we had a huge shock through this
organization<00:01:11.070> there's<00:01:11.820> been<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.270> huge<00:01:12.630> effort

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
organization there's been a huge effort

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740 
organization there's been a huge effort
from<00:01:13.620> everyone<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.090> try<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.270> pull<00:01:15.600> us

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
from everyone here to try and pull us

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
from everyone here to try and pull us
back<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:17.310> fought<00:01:17.580> hard<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.240> those

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
back through we fought hard in those

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.490 
back through we fought hard in those
four<00:01:18.930> first<00:01:19.620> races<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.610> progress<00:01:20.940> I

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
four first races to make progress I

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
four first races to make progress I
think<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.620> all<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:23.010> concerns<00:01:23.659> going<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
think we all had concerns going to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
think we all had concerns going to
Barcelona<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:26.250> knew<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.760> all<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.330> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
Barcelona we knew that all of our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
Barcelona we knew that all of our
competitors<00:01:27.870> would<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.210> significant

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
competitors would have significant

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.380 
competitors would have significant
upgrade<00:01:30.840> packages<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:32.100> indeed<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.970> did<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
upgrade packages which indeed they did I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
upgrade packages which indeed they did I
think<00:01:33.810> there's<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.260> reminder<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
think there's going to be a reminder to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
think there's going to be a reminder to
us<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> we're<00:01:36.360> pushing<00:01:36.600> hard<00:01:36.990> everyone

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
us that we're pushing hard everyone

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.789 
us that we're pushing hard everyone

points but you've got to look at how
hard<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.819> two<00:02:12.120> young<00:02:12.540> drivers<00:02:13.079> were<00:02:13.499> pushing

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
hard are two young drivers were pushing

hard are two young drivers were pushing
no<00:02:14.579> doubt<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:14.999> watched<00:02:15.269> either<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.749> them

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
no doubt if you watched either of them

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.530 
no doubt if you watched either of them
at<00:02:16.139> any<00:02:16.379> stage<00:02:16.709> during<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.099> weekend

at any stage during the weekend

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.259 
at any stage during the weekend
they're<00:02:17.989> pushing<00:02:18.500> incredibly<00:02:19.219> hard<00:02:19.459> that's

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
they're pushing incredibly hard that's

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.860 
they're pushing incredibly hard that's
what<00:02:20.420> we're<00:02:20.599> going<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.219> we<00:02:22.219> have<00:02:22.489> made

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
what we're going to do we have made

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.780 
what we're going to do we have made
phenomenal<00:02:23.870> progress<00:02:24.489> none<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.519> us<00:02:25.640> are

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
phenomenal progress none of us are

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.640 
phenomenal progress none of us are
comfortable<00:02:26.180> where<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.510> are<00:02:26.689> but<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.349> we<00:02:27.469> make

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
comfortable where we are but if we make

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.349 
comfortable where we are but if we make
the<00:02:27.799> same<00:02:28.010> progress<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> next<00:02:29.000> two<00:02:29.150> months

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
the same progress in the next two months

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.080 
the same progress in the next two months
then<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.409> would<00:02:30.590> be<00:02:30.709> way<00:02:30.859> ahead<00:02:30.890> now<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.939> know

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
then it would be way ahead now I know

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.599 
then it would be way ahead now I know
that's<00:02:32.750> unrealistic<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.769> gets<00:02:34.010> tougher<00:02:34.220> as

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
that's unrealistic it gets tougher as

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.910 
that's unrealistic it gets tougher as
you<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:34.879> closer<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.480> front<00:02:35.659> but<00:02:36.439> there's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you get closer to the front but there's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.000 
you get closer to the front but there's
no<00:02:37.129> doubt<00:02:37.370> we're<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.150> Monaco<00:02:39.010> clear

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
no doubt we're going to Monaco clear

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.550 
no doubt we're going to Monaco clear
everyone<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.790> knows<00:02:41.030> Monaco<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.959> very

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
everyone here knows Monaco is a very

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.619 
everyone here knows Monaco is a very
very<00:02:42.920> different<00:02:43.129> circuit<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.299> happy

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
very different circuit it's a happy

very different circuit it's a happy
hunting<00:02:44.840> ground<00:02:45.049> for<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:45.530> team<00:02:45.799> no<00:02:46.700> one<00:02:46.939> has

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180

won<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.689> more<00:02:47.900> frequently<00:02:48.349> than<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.889> have<00:02:49.129> we

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
won it more frequently than we have we

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.149 
won it more frequently than we have we
won<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.549> 15<00:02:50.090> times<00:02:50.139> both<00:02:51.139> our<00:02:51.349> drivers<00:02:51.739> like<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
won it 15 times both our drivers like it

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.869 
won it 15 times both our drivers like it
it's<00:02:52.879> more<00:02:53.090> suited<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> our<00:02:53.659> to<00:02:54.200> our<00:02:54.230> car<00:02:54.879> so

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
it's more suited to our to our car so

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.089 
it's more suited to our to our car so
you<00:02:56.569> know<00:02:56.720> I'm<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:57.019> predicting<00:02:57.319> here<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:57.980> now

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
you know I'm not predicting here and now

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.800 
you know I'm not predicting here and now
we're<00:02:58.159> going<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.639> win<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.180> I've<00:02:59.299> got<00:02:59.510> no<00:02:59.780> doubt

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
we're going to win but I've got no doubt

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.479 
we're going to win but I've got no doubt
that<00:03:00.319> we're<00:03:00.409> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.680> much<00:03:01.010> nearer<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
that we're going to be much nearer the

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.520 
that we're going to be much nearer the
front<00:03:01.760> there's<00:03:02.480> some<00:03:02.629> solid<00:03:02.959> points<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.409> be

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
front there's some solid points to be

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.619 
front there's some solid points to be
taken<00:03:03.919> there<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.280> who<00:03:04.430> knows<00:03:04.639> it's<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.180> circuit

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
taken there and who knows it's a circuit

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.020 
taken there and who knows it's a circuit
but<00:03:06.169> really<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.889> driver<00:03:07.129> can<00:03:07.459> make<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> big

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
but really the driver can make a big

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.119 
but really the driver can make a big
difference<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.959> circuit<00:03:09.409> where<00:03:09.560> we're<00:03:09.769> strong

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
difference to circuit where we're strong

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.610 
difference to circuit where we're strong
that's<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.909> challenge<00:03:11.329> I've<00:03:12.019> got<00:03:12.379> no<00:03:12.590> doubt

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
that's the challenge I've got no doubt

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.740 
that's the challenge I've got no doubt
you<00:03:13.340> know<00:03:13.370> we've<00:03:13.849> been<00:03:13.879> at<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.329> front<00:03:14.450> for

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
you know we've been at the front for

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.050 
you know we've been at the front for
many<00:03:14.900> years<00:03:15.200> because<00:03:15.859> of<00:03:15.889> how<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.489> are<00:03:16.879> as<00:03:17.030> a

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
many years because of how we are as a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.599 
many years because of how we are as a
team<00:03:17.180> how<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.930> push<00:03:18.349> together<00:03:18.560> how<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:19.310> work

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
team how we push together how we work

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.750 
team how we push together how we work
together<00:03:19.849> we<00:03:20.750> will<00:03:21.019> now<00:03:21.590> make<00:03:21.949> sure<00:03:22.010> that

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
together we will now make sure that

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.640 
together we will now make sure that
we're<00:03:22.879> going<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.209> moving<00:03:23.510> up<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.349> grid

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
we're going to be moving up that grid

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680 
we're going to be moving up that grid
we're<00:03:24.859> going<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.069> make<00:03:25.220> sure<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.060> Barcelona

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
we're going to make sure the Barcelona

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.080 
we're going to make sure the Barcelona
was<00:03:26.959> as<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.440> predicted<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.310> low<00:03:28.489> points<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
was as we predicted the low points of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.530 
was as we predicted the low points of
this<00:03:29.269> season<00:03:29.659> so<00:03:30.470> yes<00:03:31.159> be<00:03:31.519> disappointed<00:03:32.239> or

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
this season so yes be disappointed or

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.110 
this season so yes be disappointed or
get<00:03:32.720> over<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.109> we<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.409> have<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.859> but<00:03:34.699> don't<00:03:34.879> be

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
get over it we all have to but don't be

get over it we all have to but don't be
his<00:03:35.329> happened<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:36.109> now<00:03:36.349> have<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.769> make<00:03:36.949> sure<00:03:37.099> we
