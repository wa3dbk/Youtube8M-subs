a<00:00:36.830> great<00:00:37.490> opportunities<00:00:38.120> out<00:00:38.270> there<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.720> learn

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
a great opportunities out there to learn

00:00:38.870 --> 00:01:10.200 
a great opportunities out there to learn
on<00:00:39.790> really<00:00:40.790> cutting-edge<00:00:41.630> stuff

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.050 

core<00:01:10.900> instructions<00:01:11.500> what<00:01:12.220> can<00:01:12.460> my<00:01:12.580> computer

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
core instructions what can my computer

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.630 
core instructions what can my computer
do<00:01:13.210> for<00:01:13.420> me<00:01:13.570> it's<00:01:14.229> easy<00:01:14.590> in<00:01:14.799> today's<00:01:15.100> computing

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
do for me it's easy in today's computing

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.490 
do for me it's easy in today's computing
world<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.090> forget<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.810> we'd<00:01:17.110> see<00:01:17.290> all<00:01:17.380> these

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
world to forget that we'd see all these

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.590 
world to forget that we'd see all these
wonderful<00:01:17.830> fun<00:01:18.280> graphics<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:18.970> sound<00:01:19.240> but

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
wonderful fun graphics and sound but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.570 
wonderful fun graphics and sound but
computers<00:01:20.110> really<00:01:20.320> only<00:01:20.500> have<00:01:20.800> very<00:01:21.100> basic

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
computers really only have very basic

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.210 
computers really only have very basic
things<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.909> they<00:01:22.090> actually<00:01:22.270> do<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:23.220> right

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
things that they actually do it right

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.770 
things that they actually do it right
now<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.850> will<00:01:24.970> take<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.180> look<00:01:25.360> at<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.630> language

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
now we will take a look at the language

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.570 
now we will take a look at the language
directions<00:01:26.680> like<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.070> was<00:01:27.220> kind<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.490> just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
directions like I was kind of just

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.660 
directions like I was kind of just
describing<00:01:31.290> another<00:01:32.290> way<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.530> categorize<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
describing another way to categorize the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:02:04.980 
describing another way to categorize the
types<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.000> language

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.200 

what<00:02:05.990> happened<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> be<00:02:06.500> different<00:02:07.119> whereas<00:02:08.119> an

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
what happened to be different whereas an

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.120 
what happened to be different whereas an
interpretive<00:02:08.720> program<00:02:09.140> if<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.830> get<00:02:10.040> that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
interpretive program if you get that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.040 
interpretive program if you get that
file<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:11.030> open<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.630> tech<00:02:11.810> center

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
file you can open it in the tech center

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.840 
file you can open it in the tech center
you'll<00:02:12.350> actually<00:02:12.560> see<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.340> programming

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you'll actually see the programming

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.430 
you'll actually see the programming
language<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.360> file<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.290> you'll

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
language in the file right and you'll

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440 
language in the file right and you'll
actually<00:02:15.590> run<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.520> through<00:02:17.000> an<00:02:17.180> interpreter

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
actually run that through an interpreter

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually run that through an interpreter
so<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.800> up<00:02:19.010> into<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.310> point<00:02:19.520> one
