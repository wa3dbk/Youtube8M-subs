00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
original prop from the shaft all right

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.100 
original prop from the shaft all right
it<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.560> split<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> help<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> dikes<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it just split the help with the dikes so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
little piece and that's easy to do by

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.940 
little piece and that's easy to do by
just<00:01:30.920> prying<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> loose<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.490> fingertips

might<00:01:36.960> still<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> shaft<00:01:38.009> from<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
might still be on the shaft from the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
might still be on the shaft from the
factory<00:01:40.790> next<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> take<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> point

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
factory next thing is to take the point

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.830 
factory next thing is to take the point
oh<00:01:43.290> four<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.979> five<00:01:44.159> inch<00:01:44.549> drill<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.450> just

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
oh four or five inch drill bit and just

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.800 
oh four or five inch drill bit and just
ream<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> hole<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> new<00:01:47.640> prop<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
ream out the hole on the new prop to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
ream out the hole on the new prop to
make<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> big<00:01:49.409> enough<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.430> easily<00:01:52.399> now

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
make it big enough to go on easily now

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
make it big enough to go on easily now
with<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> pair<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.090> needle<00:01:54.450> nose<00:01:54.600> pliers<00:01:54.630> push

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
with a pair of needle nose pliers push

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.760 
with a pair of needle nose pliers push
the<00:01:55.799> shaft<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> prop<00:01:57.290> put<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> prop<00:01:58.619> on

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the shaft into the prop put the prop on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.290 
the shaft into the prop put the prop on
the<00:01:58.920> hard<00:01:59.159> surface<00:01:59.490> while<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.119> doing<00:02:00.450> this

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.180 

okay<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.539> prop<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:09.020> on<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.800> see<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
okay the prop is on and you can see the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.590 
okay the prop is on and you can see the
shaft<00:02:10.490> is<00:02:11.920> close<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> face<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> hub<00:02:16.600> so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
shaft is close to the face of the hub so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.030 
shaft is close to the face of the hub so
that<00:02:17.810> should<00:02:18.050> be<00:02:18.080> good<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.500> end<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.800> shaft

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
that should be good the end of the shaft

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.710 
that should be good the end of the shaft
is<00:02:19.250> right<00:02:19.459> close<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> face<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.630> hub

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
is right close to the face of the hub

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.410 
is right close to the face of the hub
now<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.959> prop<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:24.860> very<00:02:25.130> tight<00:02:25.520> but

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
now this prop is on there very tight but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.809 
now this prop is on there very tight but
if<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.690> does<00:02:26.870> ever<00:02:27.140> break<00:02:27.500> loose<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.790> can

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
if it does ever break loose you can

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.850 
if it does ever break loose you can
always<00:02:29.209> put<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.750> back<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.440> way<00:02:30.560> they<00:02:30.709> did

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
always put it back on the way they did
