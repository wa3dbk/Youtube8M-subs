00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
don't know that's kind of boring I think

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.480 
don't know that's kind of boring I think
I'd<00:03:04.120> rather<00:03:04.330> go<00:03:04.630> cloud<00:03:04.930> watching<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:06.250> lay

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
I'd rather go cloud watching you lay

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.030 
I'd rather go cloud watching you lay
down<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.000> pick<00:03:07.840> out<00:03:08.020> different<00:03:08.350> shapes<00:03:08.590> in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
down and pick out different shapes in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.470 
down and pick out different shapes in
the<00:03:09.130> cloud<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.950> should<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.820> maybe<00:03:16.239> do

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
the cloud so you should just maybe do

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.750 
the cloud so you should just maybe do
both<00:03:16.690> masks<00:03:17.650> which<00:03:17.830> one<00:03:18.010> she<00:03:18.160> likes<00:03:18.190> best

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
both masks which one she likes best

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.699 
both masks which one she likes best
yeah<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:22.080> she'd<00:03:23.080> come<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.290> her<00:03:23.500> house

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709
