00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.450 
cutter is from officemax you know it's
not<00:00:28.410> very<00:00:28.470> expensive<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
not very expensive I think was the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.580 
not very expensive I think was the
cheapest<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
cheapest one that they had but on this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
cheapest one that they had but on this
paper<00:00:31.769> cutter<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.130> probably<00:00:32.610> personally<00:00:33.059> have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.150 
paper cutter down there you can see
again<00:02:16.850> it's<00:02:17.780> not<00:02:17.900> an<00:02:17.990> exact<00:02:18.380> science<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.040> then

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
again it's not an exact science and then

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.990 
again it's not an exact science and then
you're<00:02:19.250> gonna<00:02:19.370> slide<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.760> over<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:21.880> three<00:02:22.880> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
you're gonna slide it over to three and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.470 
you're gonna slide it over to three and
five-eighths<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:28.160> at<00:02:28.310> three<00:02:28.550> m5h<00:02:29.060> you'll<00:02:29.300> cut

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
five-eighths and at three m5h you'll cut

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.680 
five-eighths and at three m5h you'll cut
it<00:02:29.600> again<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:31.070> what<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.700> then<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:34.690> door

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it again and what you have then is door

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.400 
it again and what you have then is door
hangers<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> you'll<00:02:38.900> want<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.110> make<00:02:39.260> your

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
hangers so you'll want to make your

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.210 
hangers so you'll want to make your
marks<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.370> your<00:02:40.630> paper<00:02:41.630> cutter<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.190> three<00:02:43.190> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
marks on your paper cutter it three and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.699 
marks on your paper cutter it three and
five-eighths<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.200> seven<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.530> between

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
five-eighths and seven and in between

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.620 
five-eighths and seven and in between
the<00:02:46.520> two<00:02:46.550> eighths<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> three<00:02:47.450> eighths

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
the two eighths and the three eighths

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.020 
the two eighths and the three eighths
like<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.470> said<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:48.739> not<00:02:48.830> going<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.100> be<00:02:49.190> exactly

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like I said it's not going to be exactly

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.400 
like I said it's not going to be exactly
even<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.959> close<00:02:51.200> enough

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
even but it's going to be close enough

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.740 
even but it's going to be close enough
and<00:02:51.770> when<00:02:52.610> an<00:02:52.700> individual<00:02:53.180> gets<00:02:53.300> this<00:02:53.510> on

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
and when an individual gets this on

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.990 
and when an individual gets this on
their<00:02:53.959> door<00:02:54.580> they're<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.700> going<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.880> know

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
their door they're not going to know

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.340 
their door they're not going to know
what<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.270> other<00:02:56.360> size<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.840> were<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.260> you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
what the other size is were so you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.070 
what the other size is were so you
should<00:02:57.500> be<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.680> good<00:02:57.860> shape<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.840> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
should be in good shape and then the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.350 
should be in good shape and then the
reason<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.470> do<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.799> this<00:03:00.980> way<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.880> can<00:03:02.180> take

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
reason I do it this way is you can take

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.690 
reason I do it this way is you can take
three<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.500> cut<00:03:03.739> them<00:03:03.920> pretty<00:03:04.130> quickly<00:03:04.400> if<00:03:04.610> you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
three and cut them pretty quickly if you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.420 
three and cut them pretty quickly if you
have<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.850> march<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.540> your<00:03:05.980> paper<00:03:06.980> cutter<00:03:07.280> my

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
have a march on your paper cutter my

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.210 
have a march on your paper cutter my
paper<00:03:07.670> cutters<00:03:08.030> been<00:03:08.239> through<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.870> lot<00:03:09.799> so<00:03:10.070> it's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
paper cutters been through a lot so it's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.009 
paper cutters been through a lot so it's
not<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.610> stay<00:03:10.760> up<00:03:10.790> there<00:03:11.000> cut<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.840> pretty

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
not going to stay up there cut it pretty

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.720 
not going to stay up there cut it pretty
quickly<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:13.190> next<00:03:13.489> two<00:03:13.640> go<00:03:13.820> in<00:03:14.260> cut<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.350> again

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
quickly the next two go in cut it again

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.660 
quickly the next two go in cut it again
I'm<00:03:16.730> gonna<00:03:16.880> grab<00:03:17.150> three<00:03:17.570> more<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:19.519> can
