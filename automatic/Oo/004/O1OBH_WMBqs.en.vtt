00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
better at it than me but you know my
opinion<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> maybe<00:01:37.549> GTA<00:01:38.549> 5<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
opinion is that maybe GTA 5 is going to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
opinion is that maybe GTA 5 is going to
be<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> big<00:01:40.530> game<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> released<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
be the big game that is released this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.340 
be the big game that is released this
autumn<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.259> people

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
autumn I know that a lot of people

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
autumn I know that a lot of people
already<00:01:43.890> agree<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.479> I've

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
already agree with that but now I've

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
already agree with that but now I've
actually<00:01:45.750> seen<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> footage<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually seen some of the footage I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.260 
actually seen some of the footage I
think<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.930> game<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> play<00:01:49.740> most

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
think this could be the game I play most

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.490 
think this could be the game I play most
throughout<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> autumn<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> winter<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
throughout the autumn and the winter and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
throughout the autumn and the winter and
going<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:52.920> next<00:01:53.100> year<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.490> well<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
going into next year as well because it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.149 
going into next year as well because it
looks<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.299> there's<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> scope<00:01:55.079> for

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
looks as if there's a lot of scope for

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
looks as if there's a lot of scope for
things<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.700> actual<00:01:57.030> longevity<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
things to do in actual longevity to the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.709 
things to do in actual longevity to the
game<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.740> yeah<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.880> my<00:02:00.060> opinion<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
