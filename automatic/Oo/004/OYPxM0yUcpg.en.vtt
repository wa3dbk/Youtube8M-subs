look<00:04:26.400> at<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.760> ASA<00:04:26.910> series<00:04:27.390> graphics<00:04:27.810> card<00:04:28.110> and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
look at the ASA series graphics card and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.020 
look at the ASA series graphics card and
check<00:04:28.710> out<00:04:28.890> some<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.190> functionality<00:04:29.700> of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
check out some of the functionality of

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.510 
check out some of the functionality of
this<00:04:30.300> graphics<00:04:30.840> card<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.200> see<00:04:31.320> exactly<00:04:31.520> what

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
this graphics card and see exactly what

00:04:32.520 --> 00:06:15.300 
this graphics card and see exactly what
makes<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:33.240> card<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.470> special

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.060 

so<00:06:16.000> let's<00:06:16.210> take<00:06:16.480> this<00:06:16.780> phenomenal<00:06:17.620> graphics

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
so let's take this phenomenal graphics

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.430 
so let's take this phenomenal graphics
card<00:06:18.340> loaded<00:06:18.850> up<00:06:19.150> into<00:06:19.390> the<00:06:19.480> test<00:06:19.720> bench<00:06:19.960> let's

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
card loaded up into the test bench let's

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.200 
card loaded up into the test bench let's
benchmark<00:06:21.040> it<00:06:21.220> over<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.520> next<00:06:21.760> few<00:06:21.850> days<00:06:22.060> and

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
benchmark it over the next few days and

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.060 
benchmark it over the next few days and
see<00:06:22.270> exactly<00:06:22.480> what<00:06:23.080> results<00:06:23.500> we<00:06:23.560> can<00:06:23.770> get<00:06:23.890> off

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
see exactly what results we can get off

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.170 
see exactly what results we can get off
this<00:06:24.220> graphics<00:06:24.730> card<00:06:25.030> but<00:06:25.540> not<00:06:26.470> only<00:06:26.890> in

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
this graphics card but not only in

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.990 
this graphics card but not only in
crossfire<00:06:28.770> for<00:06:29.770> less<00:06:29.950> benchmark<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.790> some

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
crossfire for less benchmark and some

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.770 
crossfire for less benchmark and some
crazy<00:06:31.390> insane<00:06:32.460> crossfire<00:06:33.460> X<00:06:33.780> configurations

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
crazy insane crossfire X configurations

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.380 
crazy insane crossfire X configurations
so<00:06:35.230> don't<00:06:35.740> forget<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:36.010> check<00:06:36.310> back<00:06:36.340> for<00:06:37.150> those

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
so don't forget to check back for those

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:50.930 
so don't forget to check back for those
benchmarks
