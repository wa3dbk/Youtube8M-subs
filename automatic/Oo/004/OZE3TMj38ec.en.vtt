00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 channel here you think welcome we are 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960
 again in something super great guys them 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 I've been bringing more variety for the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.920
 channel is a review but not of a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.859
 way if you wonder what a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.470
 review and not from a mod yes guys but that 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.650
 I've been bringing you the review of how 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 make a trap in minecraft and good 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.110
 guys we continue with this big trap 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.870
 I was planning 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.579
 and then the truth is I'm very cool to do 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.199
 these traps because it's super cool 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.199
 the truth is super cool 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 I have a solar 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.930
 I have a lot of guys I will see what 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.930
 fart 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.390
 but 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.270
 and how can you guys see 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.660
 up here I have made a room with 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.479
 too many chests and you say because 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.510
 You have a room with many chests because 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.650
 the person who enters to look here 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.650
 inside of this one 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.700
 is this temple so to speak 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.040
 they found a big surprise and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.760
 what is the great surprise that is 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 a trap with time and you like that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.230
 a trap with time or scream is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.000
 will activate and you wonder 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.170
 and what changes are you making to the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 trap and I will tell you 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.280
 it's a few changes that the truth is a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.460
 very well elaborate trap cost me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.460
 work 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.350
 and pos 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.119
 That's why not 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.119
 now we remove this 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.510
 let's put this wood 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.930
 now what we have to calculate super 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.930
 all right 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.050
 is where where 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.470
 where the activator button of the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.470
 trap 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.060
 which is very likely probable 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.810
 that is something intelligently good 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.810
 Elaborated 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.069
 we need 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.069
 something that helps us for example 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.760
 the iron 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.090
 let's do here 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 Once this is done let's see if it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 can open the chest can be opened 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.380
 once doing this simply 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.690
 you have to do something smart 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.340
 we put this 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 this 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.950
 And it is 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.480
 once this is done 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.340
 we put here 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.340
 we put the lava 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.690
 and how can you see 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.690
 here I already made a mechanism 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.150
 that is being elaborated 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.950
 we must remove one 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.130
 guys, I have some slight mistakes 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.130
 I do not know why 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.020
 give me a second 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.020
 that it did not take long 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.840
 good 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.830
 once they have done this simply 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.830
 damn it 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 they simply lower this 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.740
 once these guys have gone down 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.870
 they are going to close 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.750
 where they have opened 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.060
 and they are going to do the following 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.630
 we put here 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.630
 here 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.590
 Y 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.250
 here 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.650
 and they just have to cover the following 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.330
 good since it can not be covered we're going to 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.330
 do a light test 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.830
 ok does not come out when they see that they do not 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:41.160
 just go out and start already 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:46.390
 they start making the mechanism 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:49.270
 they give an exact address to the wood 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.360
 and you because to the wood 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.590
 because if they do not give the mechanism to the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.490
 wood is not going to burn and it's not going to 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.490
 effect the 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.889
 to the equation and he will not be able 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.020
 how to say it 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.020
 will not be able to drop all this 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:19.379
 as you can see here I already have made 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.379
 my trap 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.139
 d 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.840
 of I do not know what but you have as the 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.110
 want to call 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.810
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.900
 have liked do not forget to comment leave 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.750
 its like here below do not forget to give in the 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.010
 button I like and I think that in the 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:49.600
 next video I will show you how to do 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.600
 that the trap works and good bye
