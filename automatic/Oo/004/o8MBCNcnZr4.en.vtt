on the screen some people say well is it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
on the screen some people say well is it
a<00:00:48.360> glitch<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.559> listed<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> website

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
a glitch it's not listed on the website

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
a glitch it's not listed on the website
as<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> glitch<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> ask<00:00:52.770> me<00:00:53.100> from

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
as a glitch and if you ask me from

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
as a glitch and if you ask me from
everything<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.329> seen<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.079> looks<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
everything that I've seen it looks like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.029 
everything that I've seen it looks like
it<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> huge<00:00:56.340> burst<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.910> energy<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.890> can

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it is a huge burst of energy you can

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
it is a huge burst of energy you can
tell<00:00:59.280> were<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> darkest<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.140> hottest

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
tell were the darkest and the hottest

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
tell were the darkest and the hottest
spots<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> color<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
spots are because of the color here

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.950 
spots are because of the color here
along<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> equator<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:05.189> watch<00:01:05.600> watch<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
along the equator now watch watch this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
along the equator now watch watch this
burst<00:01:07.350> come<00:01:07.860> along<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> watch<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> darken

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
burst come along and watch this darken

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.890 
burst come along and watch this darken
up<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.260> sure<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> fueling<00:01:11.900> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
up I'm not sure if it's fueling this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
up I'm not sure if it's fueling this
stream<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.189> only<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> doing<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
stream but not only is it doing that I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380 
stream but not only is it doing that I
want<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> pay<00:01:16.380> attention<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
want you to pay attention to this it is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.890 
want you to pay attention to this it is
absolutely<00:01:18.990> dead<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.590> eye<00:01:20.119> nothing<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
absolutely dead with no eye nothing we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.859 
absolutely dead with no eye nothing we
get<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> burst<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.460> forms<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:23.939> eye<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.600> comes

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
get a burst and it forms an eye it comes

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.100 
get a burst and it forms an eye it comes
together<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.070> timing<00:01:26.580> once<00:01:26.939> again<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.960> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
together the timing once again you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.179 
together the timing once again you can
also<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.680> where<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.920> thing<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
also see where this thing is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
also see where this thing is
triangulating<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.439> over<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.890> Atlantic<00:01:32.930> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
triangulating all over the Atlantic and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.649 
triangulating all over the Atlantic and
when<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.280> heat<00:01:35.549> come<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
when you see this heat come out in this

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
when you see this heat come out in this
massive<00:01:37.229> burst<00:01:37.729> you're<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> white

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
massive burst you're gonna see a white

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.429 
massive burst you're gonna see a white
spot<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:42.240> may<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.140> spot

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
spot right there this may be the spot

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
spot right there this may be the spot
that<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.009> coming<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.570> no

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that it's coming from but this is no

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
that it's coming from but this is no
doubt<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.649> huge<00:01:47.610> burst<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.119> energy<00:01:48.299> because<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
doubt a huge burst of energy because of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
doubt a huge burst of energy because of
the<00:01:49.079> eat<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.560> heat<00:01:49.740> signature<00:01:50.540> without<00:01:51.540> a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
have these things posted

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.610 
have these things posted
but<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:15.030> right<00:02:15.060> now<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.470> we've

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
but as of right now this is what we've

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.250 
but as of right now this is what we've
got<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.820> happened<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> 9th<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:19.170> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
got this happened on the 9th what you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.100 
got this happened on the 9th what you
just<00:02:19.470> seen<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.820> 11th<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:21.960> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
just seen in the 11th right there this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.950 
just seen in the 11th right there this
is<00:02:22.170> multiple<00:02:22.800> days<00:02:23.040> multiple<00:02:23.820> bursts<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
is multiple days multiple bursts and I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.460 
is multiple days multiple bursts and I
do<00:02:25.020> believe<00:02:25.530> these<00:02:25.830> are<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.610> are<00:02:26.640> massive

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
do believe these are these are massive

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.590 
do believe these are these are massive
microwave<00:02:28.470> bursts<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.370> energy<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.450> that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
microwave bursts of energy here that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.860 
microwave bursts of energy here that
you're<00:02:31.530> seeing<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.490> exact<00:02:32.940> weaponry<00:02:33.630> they're

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you're seeing the exact weaponry they're

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.720 
you're seeing the exact weaponry they're
using<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.200> harp<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.800> hit<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.430> more

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
using for harp and the hit this up more

believe<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.150> proof<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:40.350> one

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
believe this is the proof of it in one

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.440 
believe this is the proof of it in one
of<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> only<00:02:41.400> ways<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.240> any
