the Artek to you are attacked to being a

full flat and of course the name of this
type<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.619> grinding<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.130> Apes<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.460> right<00:00:23.820> now

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
type of grinding see Apes me right now

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
type of grinding see Apes me right now
but<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:25.250> kind<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.420> nun<00:00:27.420> fancy<00:00:27.750> prefers<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.380> full

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
but I kind of nun fancy prefers a full

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
but I kind of nun fancy prefers a full
flat<00:00:29.550> grind<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.060> rabbit<00:00:30.720> awning<00:00:31.019> though

flat grind for rabbit awning though
after<00:00:32.610> watching<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.059> think<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.360> might<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
after watching I think this might be a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
after watching I think this might be a
more<00:00:33.809> efficient<00:00:34.140> design<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.530> here's<00:00:34.680> why<00:00:34.800> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
more efficient design and here's why so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.200 
more efficient design and here's why so
on<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.640> knife<00:00:35.850> being<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.180> s-1<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:38.210> three

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
on this knife being an s-1 it is three

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
on this knife being an s-1 it is three
sixteenth<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.780> inch<00:00:39.840> thick<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> spine

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sixteenth of an inch thick of the spine

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
sixteenth of an inch thick of the spine
here<00:00:41.190> however<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.079> batani

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
here however when you actually batani

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
here however when you actually batani
since<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.489> 316<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> extends<00:00:45.510> down<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> hear

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
since that 316 is extends down to hear

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.900 
since that 316 is extends down to hear
you<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.719> wider<00:00:48.719> angle<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.000> go

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
you get a wider angle so you go

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
you get a wider angle so you go
hopefully<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
hopefully you can see that so you go and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.029 
hopefully you can see that so you go and
you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> splits<00:00:56.760> farther<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you can see it splits farther so if you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
you can see it splits farther so if you
measure<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> top<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.809> you're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
measure this at the top here you're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
measure this at the top here you're
actually<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.680> three<00:01:01.829> eighths<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.190> inch<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
actually at three eighths of an inch so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
actually at three eighths of an inch so
you're<00:01:03.270> getting<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.719> work<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you're getting more work out of a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520 
you're getting more work out of a
lighter<00:01:05.070> blade<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.390> say<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.049> were<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> put

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
lighter blade so say you were to put

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
lighter blade so say you were to put
enough<00:01:07.770> force<00:01:07.979> into<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> sink<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> one

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
enough force into this to sink it one

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
enough force into this to sink it one
inch<00:01:09.090> deep<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> piece<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> wood<00:01:10.260> you're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
inch deep into a piece of wood you're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
inch deep into a piece of wood you're
going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.340> splitting<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.760> farther<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.150> if

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
going to be splitting it farther than if

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990 
going to be splitting it farther than if
you<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.920> tagged<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.850> inch

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you some say that are tagged to one inch

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.130 
you some say that are tagged to one inch
deep<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> piece<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> wood<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.869> your

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
deep into a piece of wood with your

deep into a piece of wood with your
baton<00:01:16.640> assuming<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
baton assuming that they would take the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.609 
baton assuming that they would take the
same<00:01:18.540> amount<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> force<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
same amount of force this would be a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.850 
same amount of force this would be a

more efficient way to de pon to help

more efficient way to de pon to help
illustrate<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:24.110> pop<00:01:25.110> outside

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

I'm<00:01:34.140> hoping<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.560> keep<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> video<00:01:35.040> short<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I'm hoping to keep this video short and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
I'm hoping to keep this video short and
sweet<00:01:36.380> have<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.430> more

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sweet have some little bit more

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
sweet have some little bit more
experience<00:01:38.930> let<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:40.080> reply<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:43.200> know

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
experience let me reply to it you know

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.160 
experience let me reply to it you know
if<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.250> idea<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.049> accurate<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:48.710> see

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.640 

ok

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
ok

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.130 
ok
so<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.610> could<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:56.940> get<00:01:57.120> started

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.660 

all<00:02:05.140> right<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.710> was<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:05.860> frame<00:02:06.189> i<00:02:06.310> think<00:02:06.490> but

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
all right that was a frame i think but

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.460 
all right that was a frame i think but
this<00:02:07.390> should<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.869> will<00:02:07.960> straight<00:02:08.140> well<00:02:08.289> enough

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
this should it will straight well enough

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.889 
this should it will straight well enough
so<00:02:08.649> if<00:02:08.709> we<00:02:08.800> go<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.819> enough<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.090> bury<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so if we go just enough to bury the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.150 
so if we go just enough to bury the
blade<00:02:11.110> there<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.739> see<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.890> there<00:02:12.130> are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
blade there you can see that there are

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.210 
blade there you can see that there are
only<00:02:12.250> two<00:02:12.550> contact<00:02:13.000> points<00:02:13.060> there's<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.220> right

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
only two contact points there's a right

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.110 
only two contact points there's a right
here<00:02:15.640> where<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.120> grind<00:02:17.050> begins<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.700> you're

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
here where that grind begins so you're

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
here where that grind begins so you're
reducing<00:02:19.480> wear<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.930> your<00:02:20.050> edge<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.620> because

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
reducing wear on your edge there because

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.309 
reducing wear on your edge there because
it's<00:02:21.190> floating<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.730> space<00:02:21.849> next<00:02:22.390> all<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.230> way

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
it's floating in space next all the way

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.390 
it's floating in space next all the way
down<00:02:23.500> from<00:02:23.709> there<00:02:23.890> you're<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> be

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
down from there you're not going to be

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.110 
down from there you're not going to be
hitting<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.670> material<00:02:26.010> plus<00:02:27.010> 4<00:02:27.730> as<00:02:27.819> deep<00:02:28.000> as

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
hitting a material plus 4 as deep as

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.449 
hitting a material plus 4 as deep as
we've<00:02:28.269> gone<00:02:28.450> we've<00:02:28.660> gotten<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.959> wider<00:02:29.310> gap<00:02:30.310> at

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
we've gone we've gotten a wider gap at

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.390 
we've gone we've gotten a wider gap at
the<00:02:30.489> top<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:32.260> seems<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.250> would

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the top here so it seems like this would

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340 
the top here so it seems like this would
be<00:02:33.549> more<00:02:33.760> efficient<00:02:34.120> designed<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.750> actually

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
be more efficient designed to actually

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.750 
be more efficient designed to actually
split<00:02:35.799> with<00:02:35.950> because<00:02:36.190> you're<00:02:36.310> reducing<00:02:36.640> your

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
split with because you're reducing your

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.690 
split with because you're reducing your
wear<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.680> work<00:02:38.860> required<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.400> number<00:02:39.580> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
wear and the work required the number of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.910 
wear and the work required the number of
hits<00:02:39.850> required<00:02:40.180> if<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.780> notice<00:02:41.049> in<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.709> video

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
hits required if you notice in the video

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.240 
hits required if you notice in the video
on<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.700> a1<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.299> pilot<00:02:44.140> survival<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.769> think<00:02:44.950> was

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
on the a1 the pilot survival I think was

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.289 
on the a1 the pilot survival I think was
how<00:02:45.940> he<00:02:46.560> subtitled<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.970> know<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.239> only

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
how he subtitled it but you know it only

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.210 
how he subtitled it but you know it only
takes<00:02:49.540> him<00:02:49.720> maybe<00:02:49.870> two<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.470> three<00:02:50.620> hits<00:02:50.950> at

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
takes him maybe two or three hits at

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.589 
takes him maybe two or three hits at
most<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.670> split<00:02:51.940> through<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> piece<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.360> wood

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
most is split through a piece of wood

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.850 
most is split through a piece of wood
and<00:02:52.780> given<00:02:53.110> those<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.380> little<00:02:53.440> bit<00:02:53.620> smaller

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
and given those are a little bit smaller

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.770 
and given those are a little bit smaller
but<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.640> seems<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:54.940> be<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.360> bit<00:02:55.480> easier

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
but it seems to be a little bit easier

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.479 
but it seems to be a little bit easier
than<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.560> he<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.769> using<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.069> air<00:02:57.160> type<00:02:57.340> 2

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
than when he was using the air type 2

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.500 
than when he was using the air type 2
anyway<00:02:58.360> thanks<00:02:58.660> for<00:02:58.690> watching<00:02:59.130> hopefully
