00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.060
 now we won 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.060
 to walk 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 what's up kids here in general I 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.869
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.240
 black ops 2 for transit and this group is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.650
 incredible because it is to avoid them or 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.509
 skulls of the forest to the monster of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.309
 forest and over create a zombie barrier 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.829
 as you see I am here in the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.200
 electricity we go straight to the apple tree 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.690
 we need to follow the cornfield where they are 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.320
 nacho on the totem and the tower will see and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 that then as I say the rascal 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 electricity starting point you can 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.910
 go where you want but I have decided 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.530
 take this you have for electricity 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.079
 to the left towards the cornfield 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.750
 and you'll see we have to get to the 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.449
 point you can know now below 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.629
 we have to get here around here 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.130
 to see until we see the white car 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.690
 this white car 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.700
 this beige white car where is there 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.970
 we have the lava that is in the center of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.490
 the cornfield and here the white car that 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.100
 makes entry to the tower nobel 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.899
 then we get in here you see here 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.420
 there is a detour to left not what 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.080
 we jump we follow 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.470
 we continue we have to get to another 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.030
 detour that is right here right there 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.189
 is now the left what happens that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990
 this big fire catches me this one does not look 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.149
 ok but you have to follow once 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.560
 you have passed the two detours you have to 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:45.830
 look for the corn this fallen this you see 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 there in front that is fallen and just 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 in front of icons like the lawn you see 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.549
 where I am not right between corn 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.149
 fallen the fallen corn is there and the grass 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.130
 is on the ground then according to metais 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.649
 here you are already making a barrier 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.049
 incredible you see there is he was there 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.420
 frozen that means we already 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.209
 They give me neither you nor any 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.220
 fellow more than in the game 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.870
 over we will create zombie barrier and over 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.110
 you are near the tower that is quite 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.330
 of a site rather than for disney that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.549
 it is quite necessary then here of 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.739
 this way you can wait for your 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.860
 mates near the tower and over 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.110
 help them not to give them the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.150
 Mostros del bosque 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
 the zombie barrier that is created with this 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 here left 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.730
 I went to create our city so I 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 jump to the head but because I'm here 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.010
 moving a bit and I did not get to place 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.690
 the good of everything at the beginning and you see the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 zombie barrier as is the zombies not 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.040
 they come direct to me simply 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.690
 they start throwing steps is like some 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.070
 barrier than another that exists out there 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.470
 This barrier has the advantage of 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.540
 that no zombie with very high that is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.910
 romÃ¡n la ronda will come running 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.710
 I will always come and stick zarpazos 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.120
 until it reaches your site 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.710
 so the zombies are good or 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 they would end up giving but good you already know that 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.080
 they come from space contains a good weapon 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.140
 and good reflexes now and then also 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.970
 you know that the two monsters of him that 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.520
 he did not show it from my forest to give us 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.740
 you will not be given to give 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.230
 your teammates so this trick 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.940
 the truth that is ideal and is nothing 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.530
 difficult the magical one and be placed here already 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.870
 it's so I do not expect anything that you like 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.580
 this trick that serves to value it and with 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.230
