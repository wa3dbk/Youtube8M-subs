I go into the atomic and I just start

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560 
I go into the atomic and I just start
getting<00:01:25.430> massive<00:01:26.430> field<00:01:26.729> advantage

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
getting massive field advantage

don't have a back row but I went into

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
don't have a back row but I went into
scrap<00:01:47.040> instead<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> start<00:01:47.700> us<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:49.350> scraps

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
scrap instead of start us and you scraps

Blizzard dragon and just started taking

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.770 
Blizzard dragon and just started taking
damage<00:01:54.270> off<00:01:54.649> directly<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.570> my

opponent end up surrendering early

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
opponent end up surrendering early
before<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.630> could<00:02:00.840> take<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> rest<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.799> like

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
before I could take the rest as like

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
before I could take the rest as like
points<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> didn't<00:02:03.000> matter<00:02:03.149> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
points out but it didn't matter but

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
again this is just a small example of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.730 
again this is just a small example of
small<00:02:06.180> sample<00:02:06.570> size<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.990> sorry's<00:02:07.380> we're<00:02:07.560> so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
small sample size I'm sorry's we're so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
small sample size I'm sorry's we're so
short<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.310> i'll<00:02:08.849> try<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.300> some<00:02:09.450> more
