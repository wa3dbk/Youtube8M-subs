I've<00:05:03.210> had<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:04.370> few<00:05:05.370> Belgians<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.480> you're<00:05:06.780> gone

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
I've had a few Belgians and you're gone

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.900 
I've had a few Belgians and you're gone
bro<00:05:07.230> this<00:05:07.770> one<00:05:09.200> was<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.230> real<00:05:10.470> mingling<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:11.220> the

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
bro this one was a real mingling of the

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.950 
bro this one was a real mingling of the
hops<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:13.040> yeast<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.430> mean<00:05:14.730> it's<00:05:15.090> really

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
hops and the yeast I mean it's really

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.830 
hops and the yeast I mean it's really
complex<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:17.280> spiciness<00:05:18.120> from<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.450> leaf<00:05:18.660> is

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
complex the spiciness from the leaf is

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.390 
complex the spiciness from the leaf is
there<00:05:19.020> because<00:05:19.230> they<00:05:19.320> do<00:05:19.740> permit<00:05:20.070> at<00:05:20.160> worms

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
there because they do permit at worms

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.630 
there because they do permit at worms
hearing<00:05:20.850> in<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:20.970> sweeter<00:05:21.390> spicy<00:05:22.640> spiciness

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
hearing in a sweeter spicy spiciness

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.159 
hearing in a sweeter spicy spiciness
from<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.880> Belgian<00:05:24.120> yeast<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.630> do<00:05:24.750> get<00:05:24.960> some

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
from the Belgian yeast you do get some

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.930 
from the Belgian yeast you do get some
of<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.320> yeah

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.210 

so<00:05:30.450> again<00:05:30.630> this<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.930> Ommegang<00:05:31.650> it's<00:05:31.980> there's

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
so again this is Ommegang it's there's

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.280 
so again this is Ommegang it's there's
belgian-style<00:05:32.760> parallel<00:05:33.390> you<00:05:34.140> could

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
belgian-style parallel you could

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.900 
belgian-style parallel you could
probably<00:05:34.470> still<00:05:34.890> get<00:05:34.980> bottles<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.550> now<00:05:35.640> it

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
probably still get bottles of it now it

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.210 
probably still get bottles of it now it

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
thought-out beer I mean it's just a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.670 
thought-out beer I mean it's just a
Belgian<00:06:10.740> pale<00:06:10.950> house<00:06:11.130> not<00:06:11.370> a<00:06:11.400> Belgian<00:06:11.760> IPA

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680

double okay this is they probably spent

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.070 
double okay this is they probably spent
a<00:06:16.290> lot<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.530> time<00:06:16.800> at<00:06:17.250> that<00:06:17.400> brewery<00:06:17.960> coming<00:06:18.960> up

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
a lot of time at that brewery coming up

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.060

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.920 

and<00:06:26.070> I<00:06:26.190> actually<00:06:26.970> got<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.300> tour<00:06:27.540> on<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.780> gang

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
and I actually got the tour on the gang
