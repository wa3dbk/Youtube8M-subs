00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.180
 hello girls welcome back well returned 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.520
 in my channel 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.160
 today I am giving you the long awaited review 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.080
 on the tints of uai with old woman 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 make up artist collection but what now 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.340
 I entered the permanent range not 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 all clearly for about a month 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.570
 in fact I went to the store and there 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.490
 I finally found clearly not the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.739
 they put all because when they came out 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.260
 they were with the make up artist collection 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.840
 a lot but many more then have second 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.850
 me those that are in range 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.890
 certainly, however, they are more in demand 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.360
 so the girls are what they are 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.309
 most used that have been more 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230
 buy the one you see me 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.510
 worn at the moment the red that 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.730
 the number 15 is a beautiful color 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.020
 very very full, as you can see 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.030
 the finish that is left anyway 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.040
 in the lips a very beautiful finish 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.480
 as if the lips were indeed of 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 velvet are dyes that is one 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.929
 once dry become mot 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.909
 these colors have been discussed 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.709
 very much both positively and 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.469
 in a negative way amia review is therefore 

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:14.200
 a positive review because why me 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.869
 however, I love or adore them and have them 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.700
 practically desired that they return 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.560
 in permanent range to be able to do so 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.539
 buy especially those that I was 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.219
 lost in the period in which they left 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.319
 because when they came out he bought it 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.819
 just a couple believing that indeed 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.770
 I wouldn't have liked them 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.539
 actually then I tried them 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.209
 madly in love with these colors 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.590
 which many girls say does not 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.539
 to be absolutely valid then I will 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 I'm talking about my application e 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.770
 especially how I use these 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.169
 tints so that maybe many girls 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.920
 who think indie that are not valid 

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.990
 can 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.610
 use them as I tell you and then 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.860
 maybe you will come and tell me if 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.590
 actually I was right or wrong in the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.600
 meaning that then the main passage 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.899
 which is what practically that by now 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 all you know about enzo is to hydrate 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.729
 lips well before putting them on 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.590
 clearly what I always use 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.200
 a cocoa butter so not 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.780
 necessarily a 3 a primer for the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.640
 lips but just a simple cocoa butter 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.140
 and in any case do his work in 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.790
 this time I'm using this 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.180
 of the erbolario 4 burri I already have you 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.250
 spoken and I have already spoken about it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.200
 I do not know him and I'll tell you anyway 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.850
 so just make your lips well and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.470
 you do this while you are doing the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.720
 base so that the lips have 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.750
 all the time to respectably hydrate 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.180
 after that don't leave the cocoa butter but 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.519
 with a practically with a tissue 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 dab it and look for it 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.610
 not remove it at all 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.130
 then move on to the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.769
 drawing of the color at the end of 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.799
 video I'll show you how to do it anyway 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.049
 I am starting from the center of the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.140
 lips with because you see these colors 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.480
 they have these sponges here as if 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.220
 they were shiny little lips that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.019
 actually they are very comfortable because 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.910
 precisely because they are small they are a lot 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.079
 from precision starting from the center of the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.450
 lips after which you go to 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.730
 spread a thing on the other lips 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.200
 very important that you have to do is oh well 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.850
 the firm hand belongs because 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 clearly have for the fifth the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.230
 necessary lips to have a firm hand but 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
 the most important thing is that after that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.560
 you did the first pass guys a 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.900
 this is very important 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.030
 second pass because if you only do one 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.310
 then the color is gone and everything will go 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.990
 in tense folds practically when one does 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.050
 will leave will leave all the edge 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.880
 let's say faded so how is that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.340
 what do I do and pass it twice if 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.710
 not even a third time after that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.170
 the second pass is about to dry 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.270
 I know it's a bit special like what like 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.250
 but I am convinced that by doing this 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.080
 pass that among other things I have to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.790
 thank my sister who was you 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.500
 who told me passed twice why 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.180
 you will see that however it will come even more 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.460
 beautiful because at the beginning I also thought 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.080
 that these colors were not valid then 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.230
 instead doing this double pass 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.540
 I solved the problem are the colors 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.970
 that last all day and girls me 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.610
 I put them in the morning when I go to 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.470
 work I take the coffee I eat at 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.880
 evening are practically still perfect 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.250
 at least I don't know if in my lips 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.140
 and consider that I have lips for 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 which or if I put a lipstick that does not 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.010
 it is a long-lasting really five measure 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.200
 minutes then vain of the lips that that 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.540
 they hold a lot so I think instead 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.310
 they are very valid I show you now 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.030
 quickly the colors I took then 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.200
 the red the sangria the number 8 that is 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.060
 it's pretty much this beautiful color 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.450
 and i'll swatch you here on but it's not 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.250
 so I'll show you and this is it 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.990
 the sandri then I took the red vabbÃ¨ 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.120
 do n't swatch it because you see it then I have 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.490
 got the marc that the number 13 also 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.740
 this one had a huge success 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.150
 this wine color because many 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.530
 girls saw me in makeup 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.190
 Valentine's Day and they told me it is 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:03.320
 beautiful that this is the one here 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:06.080
 next to it is a purple edge border 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.420
 in purple we say it's buy me not me 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.490
 a very very dark plum came 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.720
 beautiful then or the purple orchid that 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.200
 the number 12 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.200
 the purple orchid this 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.940
 and then finally learned about pink 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.380
 cyclamen which is the number two 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.840
 I'll show you some pictures though 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.980
 meanwhile this is the place 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.570
 the last nothing girls what can I do 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.370
 say I don't want to go too far 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.840
 the review because I don't have much anyway 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.210
 to say except that they are colors 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.490
 fantastic that you know how much me 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.020
 I love the lipsticks of amat but when 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.760
 I have to find a valid substitute 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.630
 a tint of the wiphone because second 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.850
 look at me how beautiful I look at myself 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.410
 in the mirror and strongly it is really a 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.510
 velvet on the lips is really 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.420
 beautiful so girls I recommend 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.400
 given the dates to these colors a second one 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.680
 possibility is of I say to those 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.480
 girls to those youtuber than they too 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.000
 they have talked about it in many are very 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.920
 they talked to me and told me 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.330
 that there are not found well by you 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.270
 another possibility to these colors 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.940
 because they are really fantastic and the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.370
 next review that will be on VIPs 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.460
 mirror of why.com that still 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.380
 I'm testing , I still have a couple of them 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.990
 I'll talk in a while because I wanted to first 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.910
 to be certain of the use precisely that me 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.030
 I had done so now that I have them 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.650
 tried they are promoted one hundred percent 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.320
 I leave you with the final video in which 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.720
 you will see the application of the red tint 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.730

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.520
 you have also purchased other colors 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.140
 because there were beautiful colors and 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.150
