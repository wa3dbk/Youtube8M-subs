00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello my name is Sergey and this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.990
 small video which I will explain 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 the rules of fangame and which I also take off 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 I came up with the rules of the game myself 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.639
 I don't know about the game. Maybe it's already somewhere. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 it was but honestly I never looked 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.910
 females come to mind 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 mean to play this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 We will like the game well, not so 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 be sure to pad on the common ground 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.180
 it is limited as you can see by the walls 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 and here glass is glass because its 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 You can break it, you can break it with these 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 very cool chopsticks 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.579
 show here it is that there will be two shorter 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 teams each team is two people 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.010
 and they will be armed with these chopsticks 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 I will specifically enter the team 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.219
 I do not remember exactly what the game is called 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.230
 room inventory and something there she is in general 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 help us save inventory and death 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
 so how would the goal of the game be 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.859
 one team to win 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.699
 on the other how is one team 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.239
 wife break through 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.010
 get to the base of the other team to 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.840
 to break through 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.960
 will need to spend a little strength that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 because resistance will still be 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 that means which team will destroy faster 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.299
 enemy base exactly how 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.390
 will need to break the beds beds 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 will be specially put here on the base 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 the right here on our site is that straight 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 here means immediately go fight that is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 I will not know cool not cool but 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.450
 just like I came up with did see 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 what happens principle rules probably 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.640
 said very unbalanced because 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.970
 thought out literally everything on the go 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 push the pad what's it like 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 cleared set built 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.689
 shelters here here such that here 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.049
 so you can take shelter to help everyone will 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.979
 shoot 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.060
 cool that is, you need to consider 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 features of shelters that is she can 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 break for example glass at all on one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.040
 a shot, that is, you can not run 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.240
 you will shoot a glass break me 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.930
 it seems more cool then all 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.620
 restored principle 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.240
 let's see we play 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.330
 probably easy to lay down a very peaceful 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.880
 maybe I do not know does not look tub 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.890
 I will spend a lot of time on it all 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.940
 principle if something i didn't say you 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.480
 see the game itself 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.480
 thank
