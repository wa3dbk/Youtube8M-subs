00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 today we go today I do not have a table I do not have 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 table I'm sorry life is very hard on me 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890
 the colored cubes have always 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 much liked in fact although not the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 I have here right now I have for example 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.059
 several cubes 333 on the scale of blues 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.859
 scale of green scale of roses scale 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 of gray and then the other day 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.660
 thinking good really told me the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 cube fish told me why you do not buy a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.060
 4-4 and put it on a blue scale if 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.460
 you like it so much and I said you're stupid 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.239
 because we do not think big and we do 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 a 777 on a blue scale because that's how it is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 I bought it and I did it let's see 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.700
 to see where it is here is on the scale 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 of blue you will see how it is undone 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.360
 when it is waste it is impressive 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.100
 good the colors to see that says that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.480
 a couple of things we have this white 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 a light blue I do not remember the names 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 of the blues this here these two that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 they are very similar 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 but they are different from truth but not 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 it looks like 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 pace are different then we have the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.489
 the blue these opposites that also 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.189
 They may look alike but they are 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.140
 different vouchers you see and what happens is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.560
 that in principle I was not going to put 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.840
 I was going to put these these two here together 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.690
 but what happens is that I put two blue 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.490
 that before putting them they looked very 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.560
 different but by putting them in the bucket 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.180
 they looked the same and I had to remove them and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 I was running out of colors and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.020
 fact I was going to put a violet because 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 if anything but good in the end it stayed that way and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 in what there is nothing happens in this life 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.440
 and a curious thing by the way and when 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 of course the cube came with the stickers 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.700
 consensus with their colorful I do not know what and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 I had to remove the speakers one by one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.350
 with a cutter by the way and I was quite 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
 aggressive in fact good I do not think it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.039
 see but many of these pieces were left 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.810
 grated is worth with the cutter because 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.670
 I removed the flat sticker so it gave me 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 equal everything and then clear when I was 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 removing the white face says again 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.039
 again stupid stupid squared 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.569
 because remove the stickers from the face 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.179
 white is and then you're going to put a face 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.740
 white there is no god of mine but good with the 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.430
 emotion you see what colors are so 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.400
 extremes I am deeply in love 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.530
 I think it's a very good idea, very good 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.780
 of course it turns perfectly because 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.880
 is a 66 77 so you expect that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.610
 you wait it turns perfectly we are going to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.830
 undo it a little bit and you'll see 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.260
 You will see how it is by the way to see 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.820
 first it will remove the stickers and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.840
 then as you know, there are always 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.340
 bits of glue are worth the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.990
 stickers that you just removed then 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.850
 I was not removing all of them carefully 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.470
 those little bits then I gave him a little bit of 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 alcohol above because it that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.640
 alcohol of the series to do the 96's 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.930
 degrees this is an anecdote that I'm going to 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.970
 comment to me I always liked 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.860
 has much always liked the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 smell of alcohol but from the hard this 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.310
 of the 96 degrees whenever I have 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.080
 a life totally like to smell it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.080
 simply in hospitals you know that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.630
 there are little boats like that in the green 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.660
 hospital that I am doing is like this and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.940
 come out as alcohol to wash your hands 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 do not have these little things out there, 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.570
 I threw it at all hours I threw it 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.709
 by the neck by the arms apart from 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.600
 if you are not by the hands and then the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.550
 move fast you get cold no longer you know 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.470
 I used to throw it good everywhere 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.670
 is a partner I had already put a 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.350
 bottle in the office and he told me to take 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.170
 this one is for you 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.880
 use it as you want but control telecom 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 the alcohol that is coming out there 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.800
 I owe it to me I just like it's smell 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.540
 hard to see who is left much better 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.640
 of that fact, I have to admit it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.860
 what I do to them and I like it better 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.350
 because we are going to try to appreciate all 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 the colors are well distinguished in the oven 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.040
 obviously obviously if you solve it to 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.720
 dark you will not find out about anything 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.820
 in low light I say but here we have a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.670
 blue clarito vale these two are 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.280
 different is that it distinguishes very well 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.410
 let's see where these blues were to 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.620
 for example these two beige that looked 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.090
 same but but they are different to see 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.070
 The truth is that I like it a lot 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.500
 had commented with the video of 66 and 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.150
 of 44 I have good I bought the other day a 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.490
 55 that still did not come to me and what I 'm going 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.990
 to do is put three yellow faces 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.720
 yellow yellow yellow 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.890
 yellow yellow itself and the other three 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.920
 blue blues claritas of the same blue 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.140
 blue blue blue in a 55 I would like if 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.890
 You want me to leave you for ideas 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 example buy yourself a 444 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.170
 a green stripe a stripe I do not know what 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.299
 such ideas cubes colors patterns yo 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.760
 then I buy them and I do them 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.170
 patterns because no man tell me this 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.410
 I love it because it reminds me of 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.850
 sea 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.120
 the pet cube bathes here right now 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.910
 because he has 6 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.060
 6 blue color codes and you're happy 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.280
 happy be happy is 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.210
 is delighted let's see it one last 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.900
 time more closely because this is a 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.419
 brutal beauty man is that to see no longer 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.220
 do not tell me it's not really me 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.700
 I am deeply in love with this 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.590
 cube as it relaxes it confuses a lot but not 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.389
 not so much or maybe it can confuse you 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.220
 with a color sometimes but good in 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.380
 general no problem cutting corners 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.780
 obviously without zhengzhou without problem 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.450
 all good good do not let me look bad 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.310
 now it lubricates a lot by the way of 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.930
 done a lot out there open it in 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.880
 alicante for all the facts out there 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 on the inside, well, the cube until the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.940
 idea has no more I think it is very 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.190
 well equal to a 77 in scale of what 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.990
 be it yellow because I do not like it 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.610
 the party is over I hope that you 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.139
 have liked this cube I am very 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.139
 in love and see you in another video
