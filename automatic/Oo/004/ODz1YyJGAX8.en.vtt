 Attacks do not just ever vary 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 in which direction you do that 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.660
 hostile attacks are thrown around 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.330
 block or roll them quite far 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.000
 Escape and insert special items 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.130
 the real thrashing and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.750
 Moreover, the only possibility opponents too 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.730
 eliminate and thus points 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.340
 However, they are super 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.980
 Attacks These invite you through regular

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.370

 The coolest thing about it is everyone 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.590
 combat use brings you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.350
 points of experience with those gradually 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.220
 Extras like alternative costumes 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.140

 Heroes have the rule especially in the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.010
 multiplayer really comes off the comes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.730
 at playstation allstars battle royale 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.730
 not over 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.500
 for all those already fire and 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.790
 flame are not yet know exactly 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.350
 if they are that for the playstation 3 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.760
 or to buy for the vita I have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.530
 still a good news because all the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.360
 playstation battle turns out to be 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.550
 playstation as a battle royale for the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.470
 Playstation 3 buy the code 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.760
 for the tenant directly with exactly there 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 you can simply pull out the and 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.250
 dry and that really gives 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 it's not just that that's it 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.030
 Vita player vs Playstation 3 player 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.100
 it can happen that it is so 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.389
 you just when you penetrate for example 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.740
 is on the way and you have to 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.880
 but want to turn off playstation 3 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.200
 then you can gamble 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.030
 score the man on the vita 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.620
 makes and continues to gamble 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.060
 back to the playstation 3 again 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 I say import and then there 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.490
 Keep up the time in sofa 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.340
 or 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.500
 from the fans so cosplay in all directions 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.720
 also, of course, when multiplayer say 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.550
 Okay is two local gambling on the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.320
 Playstation 3 then turns one 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.700
 on the vita online and maybe 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.040
 one more online over another 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.870
 Playstation 3 really platform 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.560
 Compatible in all directions offline 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.720
 on-line 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.720
 there are insufficient counterparties 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.850
 Of course we will hire you 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.530
 fantastic slaughter like playstation 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.970
 local roads battle royal not only as 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.350
 content but before we have 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.490
 also a great competition and you 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.979
 can really see something off as 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.410
 main prize is namely a ps vita 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.030
 including the game as a fantastic band 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.560
 and for those for whom it is not for the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.830
 first place enough still have as 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.710
 cool prices recently birgit too cool 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.289
 So, there are still times three times the 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.850
 Package Playstation 3 version plus Tih She 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.530
 yes and the beautiful is the playstation 3 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.250
 version has automatically the synonymous 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.960
 vita version so almost two games in 1 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.060
 but of course you have to do something for it 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.370
 Do a lot of money in the west 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.510
 send 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.070
 In the summer is a great game wii 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.430
 playstation allstars is already here 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.720
 names 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.880
 they are the oscars of the playstation 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.210
 Family partly exclusive characters 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.710
 sometimes you also characterize them 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.060
 but basically they know each other but they are 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.590
 Of course not all will be so 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.539
 Subsequent 20 pieces are now at 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.860
 roonstraße doing it there are some 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.630
 Gravity for example, it is called 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.700
 give free dlc in the next time 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.860
 but now, of course, the 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.510
 ask who is who is your allstar 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.040
 So who are you missing now? 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.470
 you like to download 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.030
 Now you like to be difficult too 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.680
 So I went through the series 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.910
 the still playstation exclusive are the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.310
 still missing but I am what looks like that 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.660
 make a statement with his 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.310
 or or cloud stripe for example of 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.900
 final fantasy 7 still one of the 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.090
 mostly beloved playstation player 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.860

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.320
 have in which character here in the 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.610

 There is a lot to be said about a thing 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.140
 we have noticed in the past 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.220
 that not everyone always reacts when they do 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.570

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.760

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.950
 not when they say it is determined 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.510
