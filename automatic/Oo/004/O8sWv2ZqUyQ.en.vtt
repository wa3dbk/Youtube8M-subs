00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
okay so this particular unit here we

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay so this particular unit here we
call<00:00:02.250> our<00:00:03.140> tour<00:00:04.140> board<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.710> 80<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.520> this

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
call our tour board for 80 and this

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.470 
call our tour board for 80 and this
result<00:00:06.480> as<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.069> pre-wired<00:00:08.480> pre-program

need to be concerned about any of the DC
controllers<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:15.330> also<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:15.990> here<00:02:16.290> an

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
controllers we also have in here an

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400 
controllers we also have in here an
emergency<00:02:17.130> shutdown<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.200> case<00:02:19.230> of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
emergency shutdown so that in case of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.840 
emergency shutdown so that in case of
some<00:02:19.770> kind<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> emergency<00:02:20.280> with<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
some kind of emergency with the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.330 
some kind of emergency with the
batteries<00:02:21.270> all<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.320> need<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.860> open<00:02:23.070> up

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
batteries all you need to do is open up

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.680 
batteries all you need to do is open up
this<00:02:23.600> two<00:02:24.600> pole<00:02:25.430> isolator<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.300> isolator

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
this two pole isolator the isolator

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.720 
this two pole isolator the isolator
comes<00:02:27.930> complete<00:02:28.350> with<00:02:28.400> 63<00:02:29.400> amp<00:02:30.770> fuses<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
comes complete with 63 amp fuses so to

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.820 
comes complete with 63 amp fuses so to
switch<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.420> unit<00:02:33.690> off<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.020> pull<00:02:34.710> it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
switch the unit off you just pull it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.120 
switch the unit off you just pull it
down<00:02:34.980> quickly<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:37.290> whole<00:02:37.470> control<00:02:37.830> panel

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
down quickly and the whole control panel

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.430 
down quickly and the whole control panel
is<00:02:38.250> totally<00:02:38.610> isolated<00:02:39.270> from<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.080> batteries

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
is totally isolated from the batteries

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.590 
is totally isolated from the batteries
to<00:02:41.190> start<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.520> up<00:02:41.610> again<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.120> probably<00:02:42.300> just

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
to start it up again you probably just

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.990 
to start it up again you probably just
need<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.960> switch<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:44.430> switch<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
need to switch to switch off the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
need to switch to switch off the
inverter<00:02:45.390> perhaps<00:02:46.380> drop<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.250> load<00:02:47.580> by

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
inverter perhaps drop the load by

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.210 
inverter perhaps drop the load by
switching<00:02:48.720> off<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.960> inverter<00:02:49.350> isolator<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
switching off the inverter isolator and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.030 
switching off the inverter isolator and
then<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.120> operate<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:53.900> two<00:02:54.900> pole<00:02:55.170> fuse

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
then just operate the two pole fuse

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.820 
then just operate the two pole fuse
connector<00:02:56.490> even<00:02:57.240> go<00:02:57.470> anything<00:02:58.470> comes<00:02:58.680> up

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
connector even go anything comes up

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.430 
connector even go anything comes up
again<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.190> also<00:02:59.460> notice<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.270> as<00:03:00.960> well<00:03:01.020> as

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
again you also notice on here as well as

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.100 
again you also notice on here as well as
the<00:03:01.880> let's<00:03:02.880> turn<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.300> back<00:03:03.510> long<00:03:03.690> ago<00:03:06.110> as

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the let's turn that back long ago as

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.300 
the let's turn that back long ago as
well<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> DC<00:03:08.010> lights<00:03:08.630> we've<00:03:09.630> also<00:03:09.840> got<00:03:10.310> an

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
well as the DC lights we've also got an

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.150 
well as the DC lights we've also got an
AC<00:03:11.520> light<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.150> top<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:13.050> stay<00:03:13.320> anything

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
AC light on the top to stay anything

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.229 
AC light on the top to stay anything
what<00:03:14.750> fluorescent<00:03:15.750> light<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.520> as<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:18.090> I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
what fluorescent light so that as as I

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.850 
what fluorescent light so that as as I
said<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> farmer<00:03:18.989> really<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.410> needs<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.680> put

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
said a farmer really just needs to put
