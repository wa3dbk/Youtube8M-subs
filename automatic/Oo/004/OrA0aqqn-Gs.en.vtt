I'm just gonna do an industrial craft

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.800 
I'm just gonna do an industrial craft
Tube<00:00:15.030> video<00:00:15.710> why<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.880> feel<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.539> it

and we need some content up soon me and
Nate<00:00:23.460> will<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.029> doing<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.779> update<00:00:25.380> video

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Nate will be doing a update video

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.019 
Nate will be doing a update video
probably<00:00:25.980> soon<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.460> we'll<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.699> doing<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
probably soon and we'll be doing a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
probably soon and we'll be doing a
different<00:00:27.599> type<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> dota2<00:00:28.230> videos<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
different type of dota2 videos so like

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
different type of dota2 videos so like
for<00:00:29.670> did<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.830> but<00:00:32.000> anyway<00:00:33.000> uh<00:00:33.620> what<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.739> we

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
for did that but anyway uh what do we

for did that but anyway uh what do we
got<00:00:35.100> okay<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.100> just<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.190> nuclear

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
got okay so what this is just a nuclear

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.770 
got okay so what this is just a nuclear
reactor<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> people<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.719> already

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
reactor this is for people that already

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
reactor this is for people that already
had<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.469> even<00:00:40.680> reactor<00:00:41.010> set<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
had an even reactor set up and have

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
had an even reactor set up and have
materials<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> build<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.980> I'm<00:00:43.980> just

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
materials to build them so I'm just

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
materials to build them so I'm just
gonna<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.460> cut<00:00:45.210> straight<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> chase<00:00:45.829> I'm

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gonna get cut straight to the chase I'm

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.029 
gonna get cut straight to the chase I'm
gonna<00:00:47.039> tell<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.870> does<00:00:49.039> how

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

kind of stuff if you don't I guess I can
send<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> guys<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.690> industrialcraft

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
send you guys to the industrialcraft

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.030 
send you guys to the industrialcraft
wiki<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.489> nuclear<00:01:02.850> reactor<00:01:03.270> stuff<00:01:04.040> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
wiki the nuclear reactor stuff but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.570 
wiki the nuclear reactor stuff but
anyway<00:01:05.309> okay<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.600> total<00:01:06.930> output<00:01:07.110> e<00:01:07.439> eu<00:01:08.369> on

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
anyway okay so the total output e eu on

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.170 
anyway okay so the total output e eu on
this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.090> 68<00:01:09.810> million<00:01:10.100> which<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.490> actually

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
this is 68 million which is actually

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.830 
this is 68 million which is actually
really<00:01:12.479> good<00:01:12.860> but<00:01:14.360> sorry<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.600> pause

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
really good but sorry for that pause

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929 
really good but sorry for that pause
it's<00:01:16.229> cuz<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> switch<00:01:17.040> screens<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it's cuz I have to switch screens and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's cuz I have to switch screens and
I'll<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'll just go to this so this is the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.969 
I'll just go to this so this is the
actual<00:01:19.860> design<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.409> work<00:01:22.590> for

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
actual design of it this will work for

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
actual design of it this will work for
an<00:01:23.040> infinite<00:01:23.580> amount<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> cycles<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> zero

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
an infinite amount of cycles and zero

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.880 
an infinite amount of cycles and zero
cooldown<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.130> absolutely<00:01:26.729> zero<00:01:27.650> which<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
cooldown time absolutely zero which is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
cooldown time absolutely zero which is
really<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.900> 340<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> tick<00:01:32.430> which

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
really good you get 340 you a tick which

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.170 
really good you get 340 you a tick which
is<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.680> good<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> mark

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
is it's not as good as this is a mark

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.830 
is it's not as good as this is a mark
one<00:01:36.360> EC<00:01:37.049> which<00:01:37.770> basically<00:01:38.130> means<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
one EC which basically means it has a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
one EC which basically means it has a
efficiency<00:01:40.650> between<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.759> three<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
efficiency between two and three it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.399 
efficiency between two and three it's
not<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:43.740> sound<00:01:44.340> good<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> because

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
not it doesn't sound good but because

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
not it doesn't sound good but because
you<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> maximum<00:01:46.979> cycles<00:01:47.579> no<00:01:47.729> cooldown<00:01:47.970> time

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you get maximum cycles no cooldown time

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
you get maximum cycles no cooldown time
and<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.350> doesn't<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.649> matter<00:01:49.920> because

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and it doesn't really matter because

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.139 
and it doesn't really matter because
after<00:01:51.000> 2<00:01:51.299> hours<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.040> 47<00:01:53.040> minutes<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.850> close

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
after 2 hours and 47 minutes it's close

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
after 2 hours and 47 minutes it's close
around<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.659> you'll<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.500> 68<00:01:56.280> million

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
around there you'll have 68 million

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.270 
around there you'll have 68 million

heat<00:02:17.549> exchangers<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:18.090> each<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:19.110> them

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
heat exchangers which each one of them

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.530 
heat exchangers which each one of them
takes<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.739> least<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.129> diamond<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.360> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
takes up at least one diamond but I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.720 
takes up at least one diamond but I
changed<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.260> from<00:02:22.319> my<00:02:22.709> original<00:02:22.920> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
changed this from my original so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.089 
changed this from my original so
included<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.659> little<00:02:25.049> heat<00:02:25.260> exchangers<00:02:25.799> as<00:02:25.980> I

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
included as little heat exchangers as I

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.600 
included as little heat exchangers as I
could<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.470> works<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.099> actually<00:02:29.280> has

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
could but this one works it actually has

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.770 
could but this one works it actually has
a<00:02:29.640> little<00:02:29.879> bit<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.030> access<00:02:30.360> cool<00:02:30.569> which<00:02:30.750> is

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
a little bit of access cool which is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.670 
a little bit of access cool which is
kind<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> alright

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
kind of alright

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
kind of alright
but<00:02:32.220> basically<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:33.150> need<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.409> least

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
but basically you need to have at least

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.530 
but basically you need to have at least
25<00:02:35.720> overclocked<00:02:36.720> heat<00:02:36.959> vents<00:02:37.849> 17<00:02:38.849> exchangers

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
25 overclocked heat vents 17 exchangers

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.309 
25 overclocked heat vents 17 exchangers
and<00:02:39.860> you're<00:02:40.860> gonna<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.360> four<00:02:42.360> quad<00:02:42.690> yeoreum

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and you're gonna have four quad yeoreum

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.699 
and you're gonna have four quad yeoreum
cells<00:02:43.590> three<00:02:44.190> duels<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.879> four<00:02:45.150> singles<00:02:45.709> so

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
cells three duels and four singles so

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.349 
cells three duels and four singles so
that's<00:02:47.129> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.700> need<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.239> in

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
that's kind of what you need to have in

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.690 
that's kind of what you need to have in
order<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.660> build<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.739> otherwise<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
order to build this but otherwise you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030 
order to build this but otherwise you
place<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.200> kind<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.739> arrangement

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
place it in this kind of arrangement

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.490 
place it in this kind of arrangement
into<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.420> yuku<00:02:54.720> reactor<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.269> that's<00:02:57.470> play<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
into the yuku reactor and that's play a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.470 
into the yuku reactor and that's play a
little<00:02:58.829> redstone<00:02:59.310> current<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.849> you'll<00:03:00.269> get

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
little redstone current and you'll get

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960 
little redstone current and you'll get
you<00:03:00.750> pretty<00:03:01.230> dang<00:03:01.530> fast<00:03:01.859> I<00:03:02.310> mean<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.760> not

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you pretty dang fast I mean it's not

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.569 
you pretty dang fast I mean it's not
like<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.629> mean<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.739> could<00:03:04.980> build<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.549> that

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
like I mean you could build one that

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.940 
like I mean you could build one that
would<00:03:05.970> essentially<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.810> give<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.409> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
would essentially like give you like a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
would essentially like give you like a
huge<00:03:08.609> amount<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:08.970> EU<00:03:09.209> every<00:03:09.359> tick<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:09.900> it

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
huge amount of EU every tick but it

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.039 
huge amount of EU every tick but it
won't<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.200> last<00:03:10.349> very<00:03:10.470> long<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.579> that

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
won't to last very long but that

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.449 
won't to last very long but that
basically<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> items<00:03:13.530> within<00:03:13.739> DS<00:03:14.099> will

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
basically the items within DS will

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.569 
basically the items within DS will
sustain<00:03:15.390> except<00:03:15.989> for<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> uranium<00:03:16.349> itself<00:03:16.980> so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
sustain except for the uranium itself so

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.920 
sustain except for the uranium itself so
you<00:03:17.669> take<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> rhenium<00:03:18.239> out<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.599> put<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.810> new

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
you take the rhenium out you put the new

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.629 
you take the rhenium out you put the new
uranium<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.099> shouldn't<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.519> worry

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
uranium in you shouldn't have to worry

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.789 
uranium in you shouldn't have to worry
about<00:03:20.700> any<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> other<00:03:21.269> things<00:03:21.650> Suns<00:03:22.650> going

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
about any of the other things Suns going

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.710 
about any of the other things Suns going
down<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.130> we'll<00:03:23.250> change<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.790> um<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.739> yeah

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
down so we'll change this out um so yeah

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.539 
down so we'll change this out um so yeah
they're<00:03:27.720> non<00:03:27.930> starts<00:03:28.560> buzzing<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.310> really

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
they're non starts buzzing it's really

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.470 
they're non starts buzzing it's really
allowed<00:03:29.959> me<00:03:31.669> he<00:03:32.669> would<00:03:32.819> have<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.180> around<00:03:33.359> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
allowed me he would have this around a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.640 
allowed me he would have this around a
row<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:33.810> I've<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:33.900> found<00:03:34.169> this<00:03:34.319> laughing

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
row but I've just found this laughing

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.309 
row but I've just found this laughing
see<00:03:35.160> like<00:03:35.400> huge<00:03:35.760> amount<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:37.109> awesome

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
see like huge amount of you it's awesome

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.490 
see like huge amount of you it's awesome
it's<00:03:37.680> great<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.540> actually<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.959> really

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
it's great so it's actually a really

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.059 
it's great so it's actually a really
really<00:03:40.829> good<00:03:42.230> well<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.410> my<00:03:43.530> opinion<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:44.040> really

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
really good well in my opinion a really

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.689 
really good well in my opinion a really
good<00:03:44.609> reactor<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.849> completely<00:03:48.359> reusable<00:03:49.699> by

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
good reactor so completely reusable by

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.069 
good reactor so completely reusable by
the<00:03:50.760> time<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> rhenium<00:03:51.480> even<00:03:51.690> runs<00:03:51.870> out

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
the time the rhenium even runs out

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.809 
the time the rhenium even runs out
you'll<00:03:52.290> need<00:03:52.470> almost<00:03:52.919> seven<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.340> these<00:03:53.430> hold

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
you'll need almost seven of these hold

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.240 
you'll need almost seven of these hold
all<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.349> EU<00:03:55.349> and

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
all the EU and

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.050 
all the EU and
no<00:03:56.880> cooldown<00:03:57.380> it's<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.560> good<00:03:58.740> stuff<00:03:59.060> except

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
no cooldown it's just good stuff except

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.030 
no cooldown it's just good stuff except
for<00:04:00.090> okay<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.810> will<00:04:01.230> say<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.680> bad<00:04:01.830> thing<00:04:01.980> about

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
for okay I will say the bad thing about

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.970 
for okay I will say the bad thing about
it<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.370> these<00:04:02.850> things<00:04:03.480> right<00:04:03.810> here<00:04:04.080> will<00:04:04.800> run

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
it is these things right here will run

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.060 
it is these things right here will run
out<00:04:05.190> after<00:04:05.400> about<00:04:05.580> 10<00:04:06.030> goes<00:04:06.530> but<00:04:07.530> that's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
out after about 10 goes but that's

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.000 
out after about 10 goes but that's
that's<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.280> lot<00:04:11.520> of<00:04:11.550> cute<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.680> deem<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
that's a lot of cute I and I deem that

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.650 
that's a lot of cute I and I deem that
unnecessary<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.970> I'm<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.270> gonna<00:04:15.390> call

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
unnecessary so I'm just gonna call

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.780 
unnecessary so I'm just gonna call
technically<00:04:16.350> adds<00:04:16.530> an<00:04:16.739> infinite<00:04:17.430> amount<00:04:17.579> of

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
technically adds an infinite amount of

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.210 
technically adds an infinite amount of
cycles<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.239> eat<00:04:18.420> everything<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:20.190> really

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
cycles I eat everything and I really

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.620 
cycles I eat everything and I really
hate<00:04:20.760> these<00:04:20.910> slimes<00:04:23.480> yeah<00:04:24.480> that's<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.900> so
