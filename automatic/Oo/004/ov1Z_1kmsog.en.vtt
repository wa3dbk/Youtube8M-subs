00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.770
 Hello today I want to present 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.060
 with then with that mouse with a company like this 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.009
 model submit 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.869
 747 pasha 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.949
 blue colors 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.239
 by function we have 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.230
 advertised thing called mother 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.759
 break 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.710
 don't mean 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.519
 I already used hockey 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.279
 mice up to this 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.499
 I personally, it is only the beginning 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.390
 the bottom line is this 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.670
 There is a button in which to understand and 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.240
 mice all over the world 40 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.720
 Ignore this feature on the screen 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.660
 only get in the way because the game is on stage 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.870
 sensitivity 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 and sometimes proton statute 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.930
 side can catch the mouse twice 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.700
 eg 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 and and uplift 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.470
 but it turns out as soon as I understand that 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.090
 only we became atoms 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.450
 on the question of freezes after content 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.150
 during this time of movement 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.470
 data center 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.680
 for us warmed with scotch like this 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.300
 previous mice made 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.630
 funds needed 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.400
 we can have nothing 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.160
 with as soon as we are just about delay 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 who got the session 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.930
 for free 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.930
 such a tsinhua color and on 1 9 in two variations 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.420
 By the evening 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 yuhimenko is a Georgian 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.790
 with which you can customize under 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.910
 myself 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.719
 without thought 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.889
 rubberized wheel conveniently 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.940
 hardly heard at all 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 compared to standard 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.540
 bundled goes fast 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 in the bldg 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.460
 with which you can customize 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.930
 Tokmakov Violin Speech Report 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.610
 thumb access surface 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370
 very comfortably 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.260
 performed superficially 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.870
 mormyshki relief drawing 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.200
 change thursday location 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.260
 straight to home 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.439
 was able to tune the steppe exhibition 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560
 we took a picture he will get from 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.690
 light bulbs 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 here we see changing changing 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.270
 depending on the degree 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.290
 sensitivity 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 red and green lettuce lit 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.490
 Well, a disadvantage 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.350
 can be attributed but perhaps that very 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.350
 many complain about hard norms 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.989
 at the same time, the cost of new products 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.909
 in place of state of emergency 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.309
 complain that the Chinese caught the plant became 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.309
 Act 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.569
 it is clear that I do not know the deceased 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.009
 no problem 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.209
 to which I can not pull anything in court 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.859
 press units 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.160
 another downside about the possible 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.040
 can be attributed position fazer not 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.519
 knew that long arms 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.199
 I don't have them 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.829
 have the search keep them under the ax 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.989
 a little bit with many 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 otherwise pretty comfortable 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.609
 tell me what risk 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.039
 here, confidently, all the buttons 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
 pushed nicely just drag on 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.779
 generally pleasant summary surface 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.659
 In general, I do not know who is the most 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.019
 the best way 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.929
 budget money mouse 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:10.929
 for the same price I saw for 700 rubles 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.849
 I did not find her competitor if 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.219
 find can give 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.189
 as a result, in the comments 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.689
 on this today everyone sign up for a new one 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:20.810
 region I think 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.579
 Soon there will be even more
