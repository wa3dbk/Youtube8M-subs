00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello guys and girls here is the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.330
 maxime before now again some 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.790
 people do not understand it battlefield 4 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.890
 right now I have to add something 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.029
 say who can not wait track 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.830
 about four minutes before 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.970
 then you'll be a bit battlefield 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.740
 4, but I have to see it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 I first told myself I really did 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 Happy because ea had probably before a few 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 larger youtube channels exclusive 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.669
 Battlefield four clips are coming too 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.279
 to let 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.630
 they also did in the end 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.550
 supposedly there is no club twice 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
 say on every channel you can see something 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.180
 Luxury what you never seen 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.980
 has and there are a few longer there 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 a few shorter clips and I got it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.260
 hey was really happy when he got it 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.429
 you can send something cool 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.539
 maybe something to say maybe 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.730
 longer than five seconds 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.710
 and yes it is now, after all 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 also and maybe a few new things 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.839
 and well it's nice to watch 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.550
 problem is just really meaningful 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.399
 is not that what you see he is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.050
 right at the end and I have one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.760
 my problems now as a bit 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.600
 single upload and say video 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.810
 hey new black ops world exclusive watch 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.240
 or somehow such a crane because well 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 It is true but maybe so little 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 I understood a bad conscience 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.049
 just not say 25 seconds 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 how many to upload and what four 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.450
 in the end, what I see a lot 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 interesting find what you are right now 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.829
 will see the clip is to be unlatched 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.719
 recorded that means it seems 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.869
 really possibly only for the 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.789
 internal alpha the km run one 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.960
 spectator mode 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.600
 how should one absorb the whole otherwise 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 or Engels has said carsten like fashion 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 However , they have a spectator motor 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.719
 in the run-up already said they want 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 I'm really on the 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.700
 full version curious if it really 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.170
 be in there 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 in battlefield 3 should also be one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.109
 then there are some things in it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.729
 ultimately not really on the start 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.890
 were however spectator mode is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.170
 a thing the battlefield on everyone 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.130
 case will do well 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.420
 many people have that request 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.469
 After that they want that in the league 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.719
 play or whatever 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.490
 and it's just better with it 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.259
 spectator mode if someone is present 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.700
 the whole thing can comment that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.090
 just does not work that way 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.070
 right 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.710
 I klopp then that was what 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.100
 the esl finale battlefield 3 watched this 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.410
 had the stream 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.120
 just 52 o'clock so it really little yes 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 if you look at other things there 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.110
 is already a lot and of course 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.450
 Spectator mode is really essential 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 for something because who wants the whole thing 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.140
 Uncommented may still be watching 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.030
 a player is taking that at the same time 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.110
 on the quality turns a bit 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.300
 that his connection is not surprising 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.980
 that suffers, of course, is one 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.020
 a little less than optimal I had 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.390
 think and spectator murder will be on everyone 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.800
 bring some things 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.120
 only one thing maybe short to the video 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.470
 what march will see soon comes 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.150
 I have only about one right now 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.800
 minute battlefield 4 video easy 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.490
 random pulled out of a folder here 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.960
 the gameplay bit switch turned down 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.190
 a bit of a pity you can see 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.960
 that a heli is shot down 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.160
 but only those who see you soon 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.080
 does not see the sky that means one 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.370
 do not even know if the type of the customer 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.520
 rocket launcher right now because he 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.110
 It really did hit it, though 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.300
 a manual rocket launcher is not 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.100
 logon dumb you can see that too 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 at least you know that I am 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.040
 I'm not a great fan of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.800
 any loose and weapons 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.080
 we have than in mw2 go 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.850
 I did not like that and I did 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.800
 found the thing as it was with the a4 in 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 Bad company 2 distance best 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.700
 Of course you can not really get up 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.130
 Battlefield 3 apply the vehicles 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 At least I'm less 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.730
 harder to hit faster than that 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.010
 new bed company 2 was the case 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.450
 I was thinking of valparaiso at the beginning 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.830
 when you're fat with those 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.270
 Transport helicopter these greasy 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.700
 troop transport helicopter approached 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.590
 you've got that one relatively 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.960
 just hit with an at4 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.310
 and if you were the thing now 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.010
 compares to a combat helicopter 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.720
 from battlefield 3 well there you can in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.320
 archive her langholz thus likely 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 do not hit anything 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.350
 however, then comes the again 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.970
 skill factor somehow pure 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.710
 However, the question is if you are 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.670
 really complete the air defense of this 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.530
 to leave things to 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.030
 because many people still say that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.470
 heli is in itself now as it is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.000
 is already too strong 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.380
 Let's see what you are up for 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I think of battlefield 4 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.830
 do not expect so many 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.790
 Amendments to these matters in the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.410
 compared to battlefield 3 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.299
 you will be right now at the same 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.310
 see the graphics and all noticed that 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.560
 is an alphaversion an alphaversion 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.250
 I can cancel more of that 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.340
 textures though not finished yet 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.430
 then let 's go to exclusive battlefield 4 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.690
 day before 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.690
 which looks good until the next match
