the<00:00:03.330> handles<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:03.870> two<00:00:03.990> pieces<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.350> metal<00:00:04.680> then

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the handles on two pieces of metal then

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.410 
the handles on two pieces of metal then
cut<00:00:05.400> them<00:00:05.580> out<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.910> clamp<00:00:06.120> them<00:00:06.270> together

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
cut them out and clamp them together

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.030 
cut them out and clamp them together

popsicle stick in between so you don't
scratch<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.139> metal<00:00:10.349> use<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> bench<00:00:11.040> grinder<00:00:11.130> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
scratch the metal use a bench grinder to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
scratch the metal use a bench grinder to
give<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> handles<00:00:12.120> their<00:00:12.330> general<00:00:12.660> shape<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
give the handles their general shape and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.850 
give the handles their general shape and
around<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> edges

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
around the edges

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
around the edges
next<00:00:14.610> drill<00:00:14.820> three<00:00:15.030> holes<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> handle<00:00:15.630> let

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
next drill three holes in the handle let

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.109 
next drill three holes in the handle let
the<00:00:16.080> locations<00:00:16.529> shown<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> diagram<00:00:17.160> drill

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the locations shown on the diagram drill

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.670 
the locations shown on the diagram drill
through<00:00:18.300> both<00:00:18.480> handles<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.020> same<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:19.500> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
through both handles at the same time so

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
through both handles at the same time so
everything<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.130> lined<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:20.730> easier<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.400 

next<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.180> filed<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.539> notch<00:00:41.690> at<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.050> end<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.289> the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
next I filed a notch at the end of the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.900 
next I filed a notch at the end of the
walk<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.829> keep<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.129> spring<00:00:43.399> from<00:00:43.579> sliding

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910

mixed<00:00:44.570> race<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.899> shape<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.230> your<00:00:45.260> blade<00:00:45.620> onto

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
mixed race the shape of your blade onto

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.590 
mixed race the shape of your blade onto
a<00:00:46.010> circular<00:00:46.460> saw<00:00:46.640> blade<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.149> start<00:00:47.390> cutting

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
a circular saw blade and start cutting

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.420 
a circular saw blade and start cutting
it<00:00:47.690> out<00:00:47.780> leave<00:00:48.350> extra<00:00:48.589> metal<00:00:48.920> at<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> rounded

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.740 
it out leave extra metal at the rounded
end<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.789> blade<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:50.180> can<00:00:50.360> cut<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.539> into

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
end of the blade so you can cut it into

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.670 
end of the blade so you can cut it into
a<00:00:50.870> more<00:00:51.050> exact<00:00:51.379> shape<00:00:51.620> later

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.240 

you

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.550 

then<00:01:08.090> drill<00:01:08.360> hole<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.840> blade<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.230> shown<00:01:09.440> on

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
then drill hole in the blade is shown on

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320 
then drill hole in the blade is shown on
the<00:01:09.740> diagram<00:01:09.860> then<00:01:10.760> you're<00:01:10.970> on<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.180> blade

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the diagram then you're on the blade

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
the diagram then you're on the blade
smooth<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.840> give<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.110> general<00:01:12.410> edge

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.840 

next<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.409> pins<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.950> line<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> blade<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
next use pins to line up the blade and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
next use pins to line up the blade and
lock<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> handle<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.110> sure

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
lock on the handle to make sure

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.440 
lock on the handle to make sure
everything<00:01:22.590> lines<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.920> correctly<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.670> won't

everything lines up correctly it won't

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.450 
everything lines up correctly it won't
you'll<00:01:26.200> probably<00:01:26.409> have<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.829> grind<00:01:27.130> both<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
you'll probably have to grind both the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.069 
you'll probably have to grind both the
lock<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> rounded<00:01:28.299> end<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.659> blade<00:01:28.840> to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
make everything line up correctly next

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.670 
make everything line up correctly next
cut<00:01:31.240> all<00:01:31.360> your<00:01:31.509> pins<00:01:31.719> so<00:01:32.020> they're<00:01:32.259> slightly

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
cut all your pins so they're slightly

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.169 
cut all your pins so they're slightly
longer<00:01:32.920> than<00:01:33.159> both<00:01:33.280> handles<00:01:33.789> are<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:33.969> blades

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
I use bed springs for this but you're

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.830 
I use bed springs for this but you're
going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> find<00:01:39.330> some<00:01:39.600> type<00:01:39.810> of
