 eyes are completely free and well 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.420
 let's start with the first the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.220
 first it is called to be stone tan war is 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.200
 a very entertaining set of tanks that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.760
 you will simply see a tank in two 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.010
 dimensions and you can shoot the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.570
 cannon shots those cannon shots the grace of

 these is bouncing off the walls 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.960
 what gives you a lot of strategy and a lot 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.059
 game when passing the games 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.590
 and each game because its goal is 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.090
 destroy all the enemy tanks the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.739
 grace of this is that each game is going 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.360
 changing and going way 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.860
 disciplinary and are increasing the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.050
 difficulty and having new tanks and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.760
 different tanks 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.470
 there are a total of 60 levels and it's 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.210
 completely free so it's a 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.290
 very recommendable game 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.750
 we go with the next game that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.760
 flame facts side of the moon is a game 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 online racing very entertaining and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.030
 I really like that simply 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.040
 you will take a vehicle you will have to move it 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.900
 on the planet where you are 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.220
 accidents and planets in two teeth in 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.200
 three dimensions so you're going 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.730
 changing the perspectives of the time and it's 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 very entertaining since you can skid 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.060
 among other things and just having 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.250
 than to do the objective that the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.960
 map and be able to unlock new maps and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.030
 is to get the number of turns or 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.400
 winning is more entertaining i what 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 I highly recommend the next game 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.180
 which we are going to talk about are neglected or 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.920

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.960
 game as you can see is for payment but the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.460
 Trial version is complete equals 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.810
 single payment than the payment version 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.300
 to donate to the author so if not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.350
 you want to pay nothing you give to try and what 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.150
 you have the game completely 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.590
 just not going to be a squirrel 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.230
 for a trunk and you have to catch coins 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.750
 and acorns the coin is score that 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.520
 the ranking will rise at a global level 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.170
 you can see it and the acorns let's say 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.180
 are the lives with is more acorns 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.009
 lame you will accumulate the and when we 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.650
 you go against a branch 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.360
 a leaf and it hurts you thrown an acorn 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.260
 then when you run out of acorns and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.519
 you kill yourself 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.750
 simply dying there is where the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.670
 grace is to go taking videos for 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.790
 Protect yourself and take coins to go up 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.530
 the score 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.079
 the next game I like very much 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.819
 is super cured is called city sniper 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.129
 3d is a game that you are a sniper 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.109
 and you must kill people who mark you 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.609
 on maps they have several missions that 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.189
 complete with different maps in 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.719
 buildings or depends on the scenario and is 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.310
 super cured since you have market for 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.379
 buy weapons and you can customize 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 many things even for you to have the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.890
 idea when you shoot anger are goals 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 depend on climate to see how the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.939
 bullet shoots the target in slow motion 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.549
 super entertaining and I mentioned myself 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.620
 I like it very much if it's enough to aim 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.540
 and to accept on white 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.340
 the next game is a game of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.620
 pretty entertaining puzzles that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.120
 called investing and investing is a game 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.010
 that is just thinking puzzles 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.750
 a bit where you have a scenario of 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.580
 balls and let's say that every time you press 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.470
 the screen the balls that are around 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.670
 they are reversed and they change color by 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.650
 what your goal is to put all the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.329
 balls of the same color then you must 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.310
 Click on strategic points on the map 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.190
 to think a little and that of the other 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.019
 side change and rotate and put all 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.299
 of the same color while being stopped and 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.769
 to think so it was a person that you do not 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.150
 you like the action and those of 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.129
 careers and that is to think a bit about a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.660
 puzzle type map then you play 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.280
 pretty entertaining 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.080
 finally let's talk about the last 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.670
 game is my favorite that's why the eye for 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.230
 the end is called chromatic chromatic is 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.970
 a defense game in which 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.440
 you just have a turret and you have to 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.450
 to prevent enemies from reaching you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.250
 what would be at the end of the map the grace 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.560
 is that at the beginning it starts a little 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.540
 little new enemies were coming out with 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.950
 new skills and right now and it happens 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.780
 the same with you since you are going up 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.550
 level if you go to different weapons to 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.860
 change and make different strategies 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.260
 such laser weapons missile weapons 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.820
 mines even weapons that freeze and you 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.200
 you freed up by doing the strategy for 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.790
 destroy them all and never come 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.410
 at the end of the map very entertaining 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.170
 You will have to go forward little by little and 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.790
 notice that it is a very very ticket 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.410
 Well, goodbye, I leave you with the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.790
 chromatic gameplay and well I hope that
