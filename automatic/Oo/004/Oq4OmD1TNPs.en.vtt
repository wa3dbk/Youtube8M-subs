phases with different individual pieces
of<00:01:23.970> hair<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.840> over<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.409> you're<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of hair so over time you're going to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
of hair so over time you're going to
notice<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> every<00:01:26.880> day<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.360> shedding

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
notice that every day you're shedding
hair<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.439> means<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.250> you're<00:01:29.400> actually

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
hair which means that you're actually

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.390 
hair which means that you're actually
losing<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> hair<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> roots<00:01:31.500> every<00:01:32.250> day

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
losing a hair from the roots every day

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.749 
losing a hair from the roots every day
we<00:01:32.700> lose<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.090> average<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.630> 80<00:01:34.189> 85<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.549> about

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
we lose on average about 80 85 to about

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
we lose on average about 80 85 to about
100<00:01:36.180> strands<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.630> day<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.380> every<00:01:37.680> day<00:01:37.799> you're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
100 strands a day so every day you're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.530

this is one of the most common tips that

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
this is one of the most common tips that
I<00:03:29.290> always<00:03:29.829> suggest<00:03:30.040> because<00:03:30.640> number<00:03:30.970> one<00:03:31.209> it's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
I always suggest because number one it's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.300 
I always suggest because number one it's
something<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> lot<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.530> people<00:03:32.950> overlook

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
something that a lot of people overlook

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.880 
something that a lot of people overlook
because<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.600> seems<00:03:34.959> like<00:03:35.170> well<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.620> using

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
because it seems like well I'm not using

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.340 
because it seems like well I'm not using
heed<00:03:36.280> or<00:03:36.579> I'm<00:03:36.760> not<00:03:36.970> using<00:03:37.299> this<00:03:37.720> or<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.109> so

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
heed or I'm not using this or that so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.840 
heed or I'm not using this or that so
it's<00:03:38.500> fine<00:03:38.739> if<00:03:39.010> I'm<00:03:39.190> doing<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.459> twist<00:03:39.670> out

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
it's fine if I'm doing the twist out

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.060 
it's fine if I'm doing the twist out
every<00:03:40.209> single<00:03:40.420> day<00:03:40.600> that's<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.650> big<00:03:41.829> problem

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
every single day that's a big problem

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.770 
every single day that's a big problem
because<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.820> going<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> make<00:03:43.329> your<00:03:43.480> ends

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
because it's going to make your ends

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.569 
because it's going to make your ends
weaker<00:03:44.170> which<00:03:44.380> leads<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.890> breakage<00:03:45.340> and

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
weaker which leads to a breakage and
