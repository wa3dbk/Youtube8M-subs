definitely<00:00:08.069> would<00:00:08.340> have<00:00:08.370> expected<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:09.000> small

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
definitely would have expected a small

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.390 
definitely would have expected a small
colony<00:00:09.620> with<00:00:10.620> these<00:00:10.740> courses<00:00:11.070> rolled<00:00:11.280> around

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
colony with these courses rolled around

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
colony with these courses rolled around
and<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.000> best<00:00:12.630> sort<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.900> stuck<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.769> his<00:00:13.950> face

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and and best sort of stuck in his face

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
and and best sort of stuck in his face
at<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.549> point<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.980> we'll<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.430> what

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
at this point but we'll have to see what

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.010 
at this point but we'll have to see what
save<00:00:17.820> was<00:00:17.970> planning<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.900> those

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
save was planning to do with all those

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.510 
save was planning to do with all those
besides<00:00:19.350> leather<00:00:19.619> Creek<00:00:19.830> calling<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.369> down

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
besides leather Creek calling going down

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
besides leather Creek calling going down
so<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.210> looks<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.539> he's<00:00:21.810> trying<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
so it just looks like he's trying to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.859 
so it just looks like he's trying to
suck<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> best<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> be

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
suck it best in but it's not going to be

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
suck it best in but it's not going to be
terribly<00:00:25.230> effective<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> feel<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.039> he<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
terribly effective I feel because he is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
terribly effective I feel because he is
indeed<00:00:27.060> down<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> ramp<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> quite

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
indeed down that ramp and there is quite

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
indeed down that ramp and there is quite
a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
a lot of you see there for just a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
a lot of you see there for just a
hatchery<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> corner<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
hatchery to go up in in the corner and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.049 
hatchery to go up in in the corner and
it<00:00:33.630> would<00:00:33.809> still<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.079> fine<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.730> far<00:00:35.969> away

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it would still be fine a very far away

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
it would still be fine a very far away
from<00:00:36.300> those<00:00:36.360> cannons<00:00:36.719> answer<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.500> easily

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
from those cannons answer to me easily

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.459 
from those cannons answer to me easily

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
going again for the the Gateway but that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
going again for the the Gateway but that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
shuttle out bearing those rivers across

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
shuttle out bearing those rivers across
gonna<00:00:45.059> scare<00:00:45.300> off<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.510> hydros<00:00:45.840> saver<00:00:46.770> not

going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.190> doing<00:00:47.309> too<00:00:47.670> much<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.870> do

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
going to be doing too much now I I do

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
going to be doing too much now I I do
think<00:00:49.649> he<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> change<00:00:50.550> from

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
think he will need to change from

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
think he will need to change from
hydrolysed<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.690> possibly<00:00:52.260> muta<00:00:52.590> lists<00:00:52.860> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
hydrolysed to possibly muta lists or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
hydrolysed to possibly muta lists or
even<00:00:53.670> tech<00:00:53.910> straight<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> Overlord<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
even tech straight to Overlord so that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.650 
even tech straight to Overlord so that
he<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.710> deal<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.039> canít<00:00:56.430> simply<00:00:56.820> too

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
he can deal with these canít simply too

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
he can deal with these canít simply too
many<00:00:57.690> cannons<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> point<00:00:58.829> unless<00:00:59.059> he

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
many cannons at this point unless he

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
many cannons at this point unless he
just<00:01:00.270> amasses<00:01:00.750> hydrolyse<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.890> scores

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just amasses hydrolyse and the scores

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
just amasses hydrolyse and the scores
coming<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.090> best<00:01:03.239> tool<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.140> his<00:01:04.260> face<00:01:04.500> by

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
do not think he will be doing that with

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
do not think he will be doing that with
these<00:01:06.510> Reivers<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:07.080> probably<00:01:07.320> build<00:01:07.619> up

let's see you see this hatchery already
going<00:04:02.699> down<00:04:02.879> I'm<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:04.049> sure<00:04:04.260> how<00:04:04.410> effective

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
going down I'm not sure how effective

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.129 
going down I'm not sure how effective
those<00:04:05.040> assumptions<00:04:05.489> were<00:04:05.790> four<00:04:06.629> rivers<00:04:06.959> here

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
those assumptions were four rivers here

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.520 
those assumptions were four rivers here
so<00:04:07.379> so<00:04:08.190> definitely<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> high<00:04:10.019> templar<00:04:10.349> drop

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
so so definitely get a high templar drop

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.650
