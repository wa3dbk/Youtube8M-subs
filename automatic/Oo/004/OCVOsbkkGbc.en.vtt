00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.890
 oh my God, it was beauty and I said 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 bathroom is exactly why a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.730
 video to tell you guys, not really 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll share the next one because I 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm doing back and forth it was not cool. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.760
 because I always have to criticize things 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.710
 people make good lately 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 and again not talk about it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 subject that is from minecraft then released 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.219
 the wine not only admitted that the mother cref is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 I'll talk about it, even if it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.360
 the excuse is that the most 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 they talk like he asks for pvp or when 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 loses a final pvp and the vagina is pedro pt 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 am most people she asks bp is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.570
 always have an excuse she would never talk about 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.370
 golf garden amalia we go there 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.180
 but is usually a person's head 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.989
 more or less like that in the whore morally 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.930
 I did everything and I have a good time on pt. 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.609
 This cheerful son of a bitch on the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 the moral club after I'll ask 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.479
 download the son of p 1 pedro paulo de 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.310
 100 right then most people 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.380
 always have an excuse then even if 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 internally she or she speaks in the face 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.409
 You're even connected. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.150
 when I asked and I ask and sometimes it is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.890
 reality is sometimes a medium that is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.350
 connected not only the medium than for each time 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 more personalistic and without charge lines 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.939
 hour will have a slight technical blow 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.970
 neco does not have a super is the following me 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.860
 It was when today I cmp bet 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.079
 that is with half a heart and you 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.869
 do not take soup without death is not beyond 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.390
 upload automatically bp then created 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.840
 she 's super server or even another 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.790
 thing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 most of those who serve as VP are never 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.320
 times, or it can drop the server and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.439
 you can not take soup because of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.470
 that serves and is more or less simpler 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.840
 but good and most people are 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 so there's an excuse to talk 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 the guy had the wrong guy the guy 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.619
 for suicide she stays here the guy she 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 cattle to hell netbr is bricklayer 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.790
 fire he is with kings or I know there family 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.310
 There will always be an excuse to speak 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.439
 and another 16 put somebody in the woods 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.989
 had to bear the track is only with kings is 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.009
 and will not change almost anything in the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.880
 your pp 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.730
 often speaks in change that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.850
 I've had mice that are worse than actually 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.690
 my name but then I already had 11 new good 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.340
 same 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 but I did not play there is way to play 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 other games did not need a click 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.460
 very fast adrian and online craft goes 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.070
 you need a criterion to be with 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.410
 bar ee such but I just played for ibm 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.240
 I had notion for a bar you did not 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.070
 You gotta get a good boost, you just need 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.990
 be a good girl and has to know for 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.300
 first, there are not many people who 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.160
 go buy a king he'll seal your 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 instinct and life is on but it is not 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.910
 well so there're the padilha Padilhao or 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.250
 she was reelected new good as hell 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.440
 delivery because when to see how it is with 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.570
 when I started playing for inter in his 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.550
 Jetty Network is on so I do not 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.890
 I know how it feels to play a baby with 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.120
 the bad mouse and europe league with the mouse 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.130
 well, I'm good 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.860
 I do not know how to compare which is bad and what 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.110
 changes since I thought of my friend and ally 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.030
 but at a level one click my little 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.860
 wasnt anything not always the same feat 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.110
 problem was a keyboard that I say 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.940
 you always getting used to the keyboard 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 always try with a button that is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.570
 different is on the button is smaller and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.510
 September and we took something to 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.730
 You're not going to pay here is the shift. 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 story has chip that has some type 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.060
 notebooks some keyboards that this one 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
 it's like it's against the khimki then 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.170
 beginner and keyboard or not possible 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.460
 squeeze the chip because that's what I'm already 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.260
 accustomed to this type of keyboard 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.210
 barrels that for those who do not know I already had 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.250
 two coaches and one of them is the ad 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.200
 and this is edson's that is controlled 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.930
 very good here for a year and a half hard, right? 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.610
 to play craft because how you use 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.310
 the amount of taxpayers 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.350
 you end up wearing me more buttons and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.910
 ends up getting a lot even more 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.120
 Good how I told you. 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.150
 the king does not let the good person but the pit 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.650
 bulls and you can have it can be qo 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.740
 multilaser 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.670
 You're not going to be the best of them all. 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.340
 I told you if you have the king you 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 can have his best deputy in the ranking 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.630
 only that there will always be someone better than 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.700
 You took the same of the same type here. 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.989
 Canada is laughing and how 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.420
 multilaser 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.600
 so the guy just has enough experience 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.430
 much on the subject paid siding the boss 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.290
 You only have to have a lot of 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.820
 work with him 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.670
 if I start training with multilaser 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.320
 a keyboard very much and I will go 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 I can get a 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.550
 way I was with my father the pam 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.370
 time blanco the difference of which was 11 to 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.800
 normal is kind the Taliban he has answers 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.780
 faster it is also ideal for 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.100
 Mouse mount is too small and 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.950
 very large and pay for it 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.900
 so it's good it's ideal and they get it 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.300
 I know what has different against others 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.430
 but I've played a lot with other allies 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.980
 But do not think about reviewing my friends. 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.650
 that does not change much the short 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.380
 thing that changed was that he put the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.750
 shift allied then there earth type se 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.760
 Do you want to buy one receive 30 types already 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.590
 if you're good compromise 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.410
 and you 're still starting to play bp 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.300
 try to start with the worst normal and 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 even the best connected because it does not help 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.080
 buy a racing for bad 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.940
 So that's what this tip I give you. 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.940
 You would be then that's it 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:35.319
 the capital was to read the fire beauty 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.779
 Thank you, but generally I'm 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.059

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.149
 right now because you're having too much 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.909

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:48.899
 exclude everything was sunshine beautiful galera that 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.899
