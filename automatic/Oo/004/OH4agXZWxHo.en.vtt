to show you exactly how I rigged this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
to show you exactly how I rigged this
this<00:01:06.990> year<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> practice<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.340> had<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> couple

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this year in practice I had a couple

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
this year in practice I had a couple
fish<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.180> hammered<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> bait<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.080> could

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
fish that hammered the bait but I could

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.870 
fish that hammered the bait but I could
tell<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.770> were<00:01:10.799> biting<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.280> around<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> tail

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
tell they were biting it around the tail

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
tell they were biting it around the tail
area<00:01:12.060> clearly<00:01:12.810> gets<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> pressure<00:01:13.619> swim

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
area clearly gets a lot of pressure swim

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.890 
area clearly gets a lot of pressure swim
baits<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.850> getting<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.540> pressure<00:01:15.750> on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
baits are getting a lot more pressure on

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.580 
baits are getting a lot more pressure on
a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.080> legs<00:01:16.290> there

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a lot of legs there

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.020 
a lot of legs there
there<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.009> getting<00:01:17.159> harder<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.670> harder<00:01:17.729> now

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there it's getting harder and harder now

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
there it's getting harder and harder now
to<00:01:18.060> catch<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> lot<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.570> fish<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.840> guys<00:01:18.960> are

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110

been on a swim bait but they're just
biting<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> tail<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.619> owner<00:01:23.369> figured<00:01:23.670> this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
biting the tail well owner figured this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.170 
biting the tail well owner figured this
all<00:01:23.939> out

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
all out

harness<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.670> me<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> line<00:01:28.259> tie<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.650> be

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
harness for me the line tie is gonna be

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230 
harness for me the line tie is gonna be
on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> split<00:01:29.159> ring<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.850> rig<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
on the split ring I'm gonna rig this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
on the split ring I'm gonna rig this
through<00:01:32.000> I'm<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.150> come<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.570> around<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
through I'm gonna come back around the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.460 
through I'm gonna come back around the
cool<00:01:34.920> part<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:36.000> loop<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:37.259> got

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
cool part is it's a little loop it's got

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920 
cool part is it's a little loop it's got
the<00:01:37.710> plastic<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.640> front<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:39.570> over

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the plastic in front of it it goes over

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
the plastic in front of it it goes over
just<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.820> all<00:01:41.820> three<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> these<00:01:43.610> it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just like this all three of these it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
just like this all three of these it's
gonna<00:01:44.729> slide<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> show

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
gonna slide down and I'm going to show

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.780 
gonna slide down and I'm going to show
you<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.770> whole<00:01:46.950> thing<00:01:47.159> works<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.520> it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you how this whole thing works out it's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
you how this whole thing works out it's
really<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.619> loop<00:01:50.159> goes<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> hook

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
really the loop goes over the hook

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
really the loop goes over the hook
and<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.329> easier<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.960> on

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and it's so much easier to do this on

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.429 
and it's so much easier to do this on
the<00:01:55.500> lake<00:01:55.680> than<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.280> front<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> camera<00:01:57.439> slide

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the lake than in front of a camera slide

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
the lake than in front of a camera slide
it<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:59.659> click<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> ready<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.330> I'm

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it down click it now it's ready but I'm

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.039 
it down click it now it's ready but I'm
not<00:02:03.540> done<00:02:03.780> yet

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
not done yet

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200 
not done yet
so<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.439> line<00:02:04.619> tie<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.890> gonna<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.220> there<00:02:05.399> my<00:02:05.970> hook

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
so my line tie is gonna go there my hook

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
so my line tie is gonna go there my hook
is<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.539> now<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.289> harness<00:02:07.590> hanging<00:02:08.190> off

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
is there now I got a harness hanging off

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.500 
is there now I got a harness hanging off
of<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:09.269> imagine<00:02:10.760> if<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> line<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.120> coming

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
of it now imagine if the line was coming

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.839 
of it now imagine if the line was coming
through<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:12.989> I'm<00:02:13.530> taking<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.190> hook<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.730> an

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
through here I'm taking the hook it's an

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.449 
through here I'm taking the hook it's an
owner<00:02:15.060> main<00:02:15.630> trouble<00:02:15.900> hook<00:02:16.200> goes<00:02:17.099> into<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
owner main trouble hook goes into the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.059 
owner main trouble hook goes into the
belly<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> line<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.380> gonna<00:02:19.500> come<00:02:19.709> through<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
belly the line is gonna come through the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.610 
belly the line is gonna come through the
swim<00:02:20.310> bait<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> belly<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.599> hook<00:02:21.840> now

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
flush side of the hook just like this

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680 
flush side of the hook just like this
and<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.519> last<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:39.000> I'm<00:02:39.090> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.420> is

I'm<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.410> size<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.010> there's<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.819> harness

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I'm going to size it there's the harness

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.430 
I'm going to size it there's the harness
coming<00:02:42.420> down<00:02:42.569> I'm<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:43.049> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> stick

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
coming down I'm not just going to stick

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.420 
coming down I'm not just going to stick
it<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> tail<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.100> don't<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it in the tail because I don't want to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.370 
it in the tail because I don't want to
affect<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> tail<00:02:45.000> action<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:46.019> I'm<00:02:46.080> gonna<00:02:46.200> give

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
affect the tail action so I'm gonna give

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.600 
affect the tail action so I'm gonna give
it<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.530> wraps<00:02:46.860> I'm<00:02:47.100> gonna<00:02:47.220> wrap<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.430> around

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
it some wraps I'm gonna wrap it around

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.390 
it some wraps I'm gonna wrap it around
once<00:02:48.060> I'm<00:02:48.930> gonna<00:02:49.080> wrap<00:02:49.260> around<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.709> can<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
once I'm gonna wrap around if I can if I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.390 
once I'm gonna wrap around if I can if I
snug<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.819> down<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.099> maybe<00:02:53.220> get

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
snug it down like that I can maybe get

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.770 
snug it down like that I can maybe get
another<00:02:53.640> wrap<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.299> now<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.599> two

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
another wrap on it so now I got two

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 
another wrap on it so now I got two
wraps<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.099> it's<00:02:56.250> tighter<00:02:56.549> it's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
wraps on it so now it's tighter it's

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000 
wraps on it so now it's tighter it's
shorter<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.269> closer<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> bait<00:02:58.010> it's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
shorter it's closer to the bait it's

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.310 
shorter it's closer to the bait it's
snug<00:02:59.370> din<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.880> am<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.870> having<00:03:00.989> fun

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
snug din and I am really having fun
