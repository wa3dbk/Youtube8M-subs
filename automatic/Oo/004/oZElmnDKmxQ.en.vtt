00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.983
REALLY SORRY the sound is so bad.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.300
Avoiding the curb lane because of the door zone.

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:18.046
This guy passes me in the left turn lane - which is illegal.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.595
I point - "The light's red"

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:24.344
"stealth" cop car - markings are almost invisible in daylight.

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.644
Signal a right lane change.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:37.184
Siren chirp from the cop behind me.

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.394
Cop: pull over to the right.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.751
Me: How can I help you?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.020
Cop: When you're being overtaken, you have to turn out to the right of the lane as far as possible.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.764
Me: Yeah, I did.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.400
Cop: "You were in the middle of the road."

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.900
Me: "Yes I was."

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.400
Cop "I saw you in the middle of the lane."

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.720
Me "I didn't see you, where were you?"

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.645
Cop "I was parked at the side of the road."

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:16.077
Me: [I honestly have no idea if you can hear it, comment]

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.234
Cop: "That guy had to pull out into the median to pass you."

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:19.734
Me: "Why did he have to pass me?"

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:22.414
Cop: "Because you were in the middle of the lane."  [I think.]

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.098
Me: "Right, so, when we got to the red light, where was he?"

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.100
Cop: "He was over here."

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.880
Me: "Yeah, see this light was red."

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.949
Cop: "The light was not red." [I think]

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.531
Me: "Ok. Can I have your card and I'll send you the video?" [Maybe - sorry]

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020
Cop: "No, I don't have a card for you."

00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:40.332
Me: "Well, let me explain, [something] I was riding as far out as I need for safe passage." [maybe]

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.303
Me: "We're Ok, the light's red."

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020
Cop: "I don't have to come out there."

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.749
Me: "I know you don't, but look! Look down this lane! Look at this cyclist! Does that look safe to you?"

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.416
"Do you see where the doors are?"

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:51.693
Cop: [No idea, I wasn't listening - his lack of empathy or willingness to even *look* lost me]

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.192
Me: "I was as far right as possible. "

00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:03.083
Me: "look," [pointing at a completely damaged, obliterated license plate] Look at that plate! Aren't you going to do anything about that?"

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:06.148
Me: "Sir..." [then I gave up and shook my head - can only talk to a wall so long]

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:11.499
Nice touch here, where he blocked my access to the street to make sure he could pull out first.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:16.875
Me "Get out my way, so I can re-enter traffic."

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:25.168
Yeah, so this is still the safest spot, and I'm still faster than the cars. . .

00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:33.547
PedalKid thinks she should have a nap. Boring.

00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:49.291
Me: "Do you want me to ride beside the doors?"

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.572
Cop: "I'm doing you a courtesy by not giving you a ticket."

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.040
Me: "No, I'm asking you for guidance, sir, do you want me to ride beside the doors? Where is the safe place to ride?"

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.040
Me: "You won't look at it from my perspective."

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.380
Cop: "You have to know the law if you're going to ride a bike." [roughly]

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.460
Me: "I do! As far right as it is practicable for me to travel. That lane is not."

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:10.245
Me: "I want your badge number [something]. 10170. Thank you."

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:12.062
Me: "Drive safely."

00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:21.721
He sees me signalling left, just get out of my way, move. He does, sloooooowly.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:26.934
Yup, here's where I ride.

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:40.995
Illegally parked truck keeps me out of the right lane.

00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:52.394
Me "Why don't you do something about this so I can ride in that lane?"

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:53.857
Signalling a right hand turn. Just to get out of there.
