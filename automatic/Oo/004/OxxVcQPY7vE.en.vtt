00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Yet this is indeed the duo 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.879
 a gift but what worries me afp 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.140
 a gift msp or you tell alive that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 do not sing he's just telling you his 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 life is full who are interested 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 by his I'm saying ok we did a but 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.679
 I do not really approach my life in fact I 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.490
 will tell you several things that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.770
 I have lots of things to tell you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 so first of all I created myself a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.369
 email address so hello youtube 36 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 vaginal standard not yet so I 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 you zoom in on it so in fact 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.039
 that's the email address she's going to be for 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 what do you do for example 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 send me a message like that my 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 message and you tell me my address 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.329
 mail so I'm going to copy paste 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 I would put it of course sea â€‹â€‹bar 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 info 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 so here you put that and cat objects 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 if you want me to be worthy moore I 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.790
 youtube numerial watch or not because 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.960
 maybe sometimes I will do or do 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 you say but I do not know if I have so much 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.770
 you put little v6 you want that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.870
 nobody is going there is you put public 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.699
 and for example the subject I wanted 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 talk about them for example if you have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 problems from you being hidden 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.159
 youtube for example I'm afraid of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 start my sentence after I start 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.189
 to say what you want to do on 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
 our youtube channel and all so the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.320
 floor a great good idea actually I 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.600
 will do my video like this and if I want to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 to say thank you really a very good so I 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780
 I'm going to get sick of my life 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.400
 on a theme for example that I find 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.689
 interesting what game meet the loved 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.560
 of course and after I will give you 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.640
 your opinion that you put in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 comment and the cabbage it's a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 good idea 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 and besides there's nobody else he has 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.290
 does so if you think about mekla or even 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.790
 time a comment and of course if you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.770
 want the males stay river du 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 wolf of course he will be private 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 do not know, here we did not see 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 anything else here is really 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.490
 how do you have problems because 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320
 that it's a message to say by 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.399
 example that youtube go in like that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.229
 all that is useless in fact so 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.630
 here I can not wear what is it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.369
 that I do not arrive before the gifts of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.209
 cars that's it's a million one hundred who 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.850
 is really too hot you 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.860
 thank that I continue I know more 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.179

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.679
 you really say to please not me 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.009
 hear things that can be said about 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.630
 this case did things like that 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 No, I no longer have the match turned to 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.079
