much<00:04:03.120> only<00:04:03.510> need<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:04.880> 99<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.390> level<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.840> like

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
much only need like 99 to level up like

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.240 
much only need like 99 to level up like
214<00:04:07.709> levels<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.260> about<00:04:10.470> like

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
214 levels and that this is about like

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.550 
214 levels and that this is about like
five<00:04:11.790> times<00:04:12.120> more<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.900> pretty<00:04:13.079> much<00:04:13.200> need

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
five times more so you pretty much need

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.699 
five times more so you pretty much need
about<00:04:13.799> four<00:04:14.790> or<00:04:14.820> five<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.329> 99<00:04:15.810> relief<00:04:16.229> packages

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
about four or five of 99 relief packages

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.920 
about four or five of 99 relief packages
so<00:04:16.950> ninety-nine<00:04:17.940> ninety-nine<00:04:18.390> ninety-nine

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so ninety-nine ninety-nine ninety-nine

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.050 
so ninety-nine ninety-nine ninety-nine
ninety-nine<00:04:19.500> ninety-nine<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.669> couple

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
ninety-nine ninety-nine like a couple

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060 
ninety-nine ninety-nine like a couple
slots<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.479> 99<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.260> then<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.770> should<00:04:22.919> be

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
slots of 99 and then you should be

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.860 
slots of 99 and then you should be
pretty<00:04:23.280> much<00:04:23.400> set<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.270> should<00:04:24.419> level<00:04:24.630> up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
pretty much set and you should level up

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.150 
pretty much set and you should level up
so<00:04:25.880> yeah<00:04:26.880> that's<00:04:27.870> how<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.350> pretty<00:04:28.650> much<00:04:28.710> level

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
so yeah that's how you pretty much level

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.350 
so yeah that's how you pretty much level
up<00:04:29.280> your<00:04:29.310> skill<00:04:29.700> at<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.880> beginning<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.240> the
