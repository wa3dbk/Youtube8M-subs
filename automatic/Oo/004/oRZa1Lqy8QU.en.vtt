00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.860
 good day 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.040
 welcome to my new year 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.200
 master class and today's decoration 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.850
 which we will do relates 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.920
 rather not so much for the New Year 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 holidays as Christmas 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.470
 because we will make songs with you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 Zemstvo whistle 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 let me tell you what for this to us 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 will need 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 we need paper density format 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 a4 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
 probably most likely if you find 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.809
 denser even better we will need 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.609
 cut a paper square with sides along 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.180
 twenty one centimeter 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.910
 and then what we will do is add up 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.019
 first like this 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 triangle well ironed 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.370
 I open it now we fold by work 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.070
 direction do the same triangle 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.530
 this will be our workpiece I'm being 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:21.630
 the stars opened up but now we fold 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.200
 turning into a rectangle again 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 open and fold again in another 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 direction that we have our square 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.250
 will be difficult in all possible and 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.920
 possible directions we open here 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 places here where we have from the side 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 here he sees a bend 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.300
 we cut off with scissors not down a little bit 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.300
 reaching the middle that is like this 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.399
 from all sides we need to do 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:11.830
 here are the cuts we need 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:13.680
 take sides which are such here 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.319
 and with a twist 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.379
 inside connect like this ironed 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:27.790
 here is a triangle 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:30.610
 do the same thing with everyone so 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.069
 let's say petals that we have 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.099
 turned out further we take glue 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.049
 generally advise stationery glue but I 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.510
 I know from my own experience that much that 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.880
 glued with stationery glue early or 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.239
 it comes off late so I always 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:56.549
 I work as you already know well stick together 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.549
 Mom slightly grease 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:10.019
 one side and to her top so here 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:10.019
 holding put her neighbor 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.930
 you and I are doing this 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.730
 the convex thing ray of our star 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.630
 so that the 3d volume is not the same 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.740
 doing the rest we get here 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.070
 so here we have with you 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.510
 I already have one construction 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:43.070
 how are there and now they need 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:49.460
 attach to each other like this 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:54.230
 way and stick attach look 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.330
 the places where your papers fit together 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.960
 your paper and there 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.020
 it and spread the glue presses 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.990
 Svetka for the rays do not hold because 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.580
 they can disperse the parties already 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.220
 the end result will be different 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.550
 handsome so you press down a friend 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.959
 to a friend for the top and so in the end we have 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.350
 It turned out such three-dimensional 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.140
 volumetric stars are beautiful somewhere 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:30.160
 You can not have a bone lily as a lawyer 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:33.530
 thread a beautiful shiny thread and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.410
 hang anywhere lum game like 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.190
 stars to decorate any room like 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.560
 home and kindergarten school and office 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.620
 I hope you liked this master 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.620
 class see you all comes
