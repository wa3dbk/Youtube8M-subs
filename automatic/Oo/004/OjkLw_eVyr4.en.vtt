the only thing that I can think of at

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.270 
the only thing that I can think of at
the<00:06:39.970> moment<00:06:40.390> is<00:06:40.590> transit<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.830> power<00:06:42.100> will

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
the moment is transit the power will

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.180 
the moment is transit the power will
move<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.640> other<00:06:42.940> guard<00:06:43.150> that<00:06:43.300> all<00:06:43.450> zombie<00:06:43.960> is

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
underground it looks like it's been

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.810 
underground it looks like it's been
disguised<00:06:47.020> as<00:06:47.350> a<00:06:47.740> toilet<00:06:48.250> because<00:06:48.370> when<00:06:48.730> you

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820
