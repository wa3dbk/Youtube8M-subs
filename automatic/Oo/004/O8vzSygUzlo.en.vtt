whole galactic war because it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.580 
whole galactic war because it's
fundamentally<00:01:21.689> different<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.170> way<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
fundamentally different in that way we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
fundamentally different in that way we
