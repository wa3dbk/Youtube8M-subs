00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
part yeah you know there's always that

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.030 
part yeah you know there's always that
one<00:03:53.870> piece<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.800> never<00:03:55.090> does<00:03:56.090> you're<00:03:56.330> right<00:03:56.540> so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
one piece I never does you're right so

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.550 
one piece I never does you're right so
basically<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.190> am<00:03:58.550> just<00:03:58.870> finger

basically I am just finger
I<00:04:00.590> guess<00:04:01.280> separating<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.360> curls<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:03.050> give<00:04:03.200> a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
I guess separating the curls to give a

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.680 
I guess separating the curls to give a
fuller<00:04:03.800> look<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.709> then<00:04:06.709> I'm<00:04:07.100> going<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.690> yes

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
fuller look and then I'm going to yes

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.750 
fuller look and then I'm going to yes
