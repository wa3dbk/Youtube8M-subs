the third chord we're going to do is the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.350 
the third chord we're going to do is the
dominant<00:02:40.160> seven<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.700> particular<00:02:41.000> we're<00:02:41.330> going

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
dominant seven in particular we're going

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.840 
dominant seven in particular we're going

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
to a C dominant seven so we have C we

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.920 
to a C dominant seven so we have C we
have<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.000> major<00:02:47.300> third<00:02:47.630> which<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.020> e<00:02:49.660> G<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
have a major third which is e G is the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.520 
have a major third which is e G is the
fifth<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.820> flat<00:02:52.820> 7<00:02:53.270> which<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> b-flat<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:57.320> it's

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
fifth a flat 7 which is a b-flat so it's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.910 
fifth a flat 7 which is a b-flat so it's
going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.740> sound<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.160> this<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.480> we<00:03:05.630> play<00:03:05.870> C<00:03:06.590> e

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
going to sound like this so we play C e

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.900 
for our fourth chord we're going to have
an<00:03:25.330> Augmented<00:03:26.020> seven<00:03:26.710> chord<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
an Augmented seven chord so this is a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.760 
an Augmented seven chord so this is a
dominant<00:03:28.360> seven<00:03:28.720> chord<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:29.170> an<00:03:29.290> Augmented

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
dominant seven chord with an Augmented

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.500 
dominant seven chord with an Augmented
fifth<00:03:30.040> there<00:03:30.610> are<00:03:30.700> many<00:03:30.820> different<00:03:31.180> augmented

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
fifth there are many different augmented

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.120 
fifth there are many different augmented
chords<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.930> chose<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.350> do<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.620> one<00:03:32.830> because<00:03:32.950> I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
chords I chose to do this one because I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.490 
chords I chose to do this one because I
find<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.460> very<00:03:33.490> useful<00:03:33.780> because<00:03:34.780> when<00:03:35.140> we<00:03:35.320> are

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
find it very useful because when we are

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.120 
find it very useful because when we are
resolving<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:37.030> five<00:03:37.930> chord<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.470> one<00:03:38.770> chord

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
resolving a five chord to a one chord

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.340 
resolving a five chord to a one chord
this<00:03:39.610> shape<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.180> particular<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.080> quite

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
this shape in particular can be quite

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.430 
this shape in particular can be quite
useful<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:42.130> Augmented<00:03:42.550> triad<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:43.330> built<00:03:44.230> on

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
useful the Augmented triad is built on

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.210 
useful the Augmented triad is built on
two<00:03:45.190> major<00:03:45.670> thirds<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.660> have<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.200> root<00:03:48.010> which

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
two major thirds so we have a root which

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.850 
two major thirds so we have a root which
is<00:03:48.250> C<00:03:49.050> major<00:03:50.050> third<00:03:50.530> which<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:52.860> Augmented

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
is C major third which is a Augmented

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.020 
is C major third which is a Augmented
fifth<00:03:54.190> which<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.240> G<00:03:55.510> sharp<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.070> flat<00:03:57.460> 7

diminished chord now what makes it
diminish<00:04:32.230> special<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.860> unique<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.730> it's

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
diminish special and unique is that it's

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.390 
diminish special and unique is that it's
built<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.390> minor<00:04:34.840> thirds<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:36.160> what<00:04:36.310> we're

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
built on minor thirds so what we're

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.240 
built on minor thirds so what we're
going<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.610> have<00:04:36.790> here<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.240> C<00:04:38.140> for<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.470> root<00:04:38.680> B

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
going to have here is C for the root B

diminished fifth and then a B double
flat<00:04:45.820> for<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.570> seventh<00:04:47.110> now<00:04:47.350> obviously<00:04:47.740> I'm

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
flat for the seventh now obviously I'm

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.560 
flat for the seventh now obviously I'm
playing<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.610> mean<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.240> spell<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.480> correctly

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
playing a mean but to spell it correctly

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.290 
playing a mean but to spell it correctly
it<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.410> B<00:04:50.710> double<00:04:51.070> flat<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:51.880> gonna<00:04:52.060> sound

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
it is a B double flat it's gonna sound

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.730 
it is a B double flat it's gonna sound
like<00:04:52.450> this

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.060 

so<00:04:59.740> we<00:04:59.890> have<00:05:00.100> C<00:05:00.730> E<00:05:01.000> flat<00:05:01.080> C<00:05:02.080> B<00:05:03.990> double<00:05:04.990> flat<00:05:05.260> C<00:05:05.740> me

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
so we have C E flat C B double flat C me

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.710 
so we have C E flat C B double flat C me
double<00:05:06.520> flat<00:05:06.790> G<00:05:07.690> flat<00:05:07.720> B<00:05:08.620> double<00:05:09.010> flat<00:05:09.220> G<00:05:09.550> flat
