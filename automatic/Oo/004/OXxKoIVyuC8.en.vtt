00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.370
 Haydns now switch powerful inside demonstrating how body and mind 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.679
 So it all comes down to movement 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.499
 mental 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:20.289
 normal 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.079
 we are looking for 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.199
 like Rolf that the lower back so a little money approx 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.489
 has become clear 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.569
 head down 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.679
 we make it quite conscious now that my feeling get like carbon 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.850
 Geis related, look at it deliberately on the ground 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 our face 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 Today is a beautiful day 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 believe it yourself 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.780
 No, wonderful 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 then they put themselves job Kotenev in a blanket 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560
 and say which 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 today is no understanding 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.579
 and also there you will notice it does not work that has something 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.270
 to do that we are in different holding position in 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.670
 different areas in our brain traverses the different ones 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 to thank 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.460
 being affected 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 and sees the present as an example that body and mind are each other 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.290
 the 1 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.690
 So I can both about my thoughts 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 Change mood as well as my posture 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.570
 what it did not want to take it actually nobody optimally used 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.270
 because that, of course, is related to our attitude and Reken ERA and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.479
 Outside of sensitive times, I ask you to get up 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 to accept the left leg 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.189
 with the hand Mai to access the seat because there is no bone 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060
 Stand this is the so-called puts both hackers 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.260
 we have that on both sides 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.610
 and if that set goals 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.120
 sit down again 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.210
 Concentrate on this now when contacting Dr 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.350
 Setz surface has really only on the contact 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.940
 from the bones to the seat 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.860
 be careful 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
 and then they will realize that they are setting it straight straight from the start 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.289
 the lower back missed out relaxed 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.559
 and this is the optimal sitting position in which to get no back pain 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.389
 guards are concentrated 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.489
 the eyes are clear 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.829
 that's the chat 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:22.919
 to use optimally
