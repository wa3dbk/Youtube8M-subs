a bubble flag in this very simple all

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.930 
a bubble flag in this very simple all
you<00:00:13.530> need<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.309> multiplication<00:00:15.059> signs

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
you need is some multiplication signs

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.670 
you need is some multiplication signs
square<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:19.140> brigadier<00:00:19.619> general<00:00:20.220> Starr<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
square and a brigadier general Starr and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
square and a brigadier general Starr and
we're<00:00:22.680> gonna<00:00:22.800> start<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.400> square<00:00:23.880> we're

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
we're gonna start out with square we're

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.679 
we're gonna start out with square we're
just<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> enlarge<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.660> out

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just going to enlarge it all the way out

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.939 
just going to enlarge it all the way out
and<00:00:28.349> we're<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.460> change<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> color<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
and we're gonna change the color of it

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:42.110 
and we're gonna change the color of it
to<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> nice<00:00:32.480> red<00:00:36.620> find<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> red<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:41.120> find

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to a nice red find the red here find

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
to a nice red find the red here find
something<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:43.200> close<00:00:43.820> ok<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
something is pretty close ok got that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.930 
something is pretty close ok got that
I'm<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> move<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
I'm going to move on to the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.130 
I'm going to move on to the
multiplication<00:00:47.940> symbol<00:00:49.910> large<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.549 

stopped<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:56.809> will<00:00:57.809> change<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
stopped there will change this one to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
stopped there will change this one to
white<00:01:00.890> duplicated<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:06.500> just<00:01:07.500> kind<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
white duplicated now we just kind of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.090 
white duplicated now we just kind of
look<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.880> nice<00:01:09.180> blue<00:01:10.880> dark<00:01:11.880> blue<00:01:13.340> find<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
look for a nice blue dark blue find that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
look for a nice blue dark blue find that
we're<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> decrease<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> size

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we're just going to decrease the size

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.160 
we're just going to decrease the size
slightly<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> body<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.900> mound

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
slightly so we have like a body to mound

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
slightly so we have like a body to mound
by<00:01:22.640> created<00:01:23.640> by<00:01:23.820> V<00:01:25.670> multiplication<00:01:26.670> sign

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
by created by V multiplication sign

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
by created by V multiplication sign
underneath<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.229> need<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> look

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
underneath it and then we need to look

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
underneath it and then we need to look
for<00:01:31.680> our<00:01:31.979> brigadier<00:01:32.520> general<00:01:33.270> Starr<00:01:36.170> let's

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
for our brigadier general Starr let's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
for our brigadier general Starr let's
grow<00:01:37.470> through<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> find<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:41.659> right

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
grow through here and find it right

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
grow through here and find it right
there<00:01:42.960> okay<00:01:44.180> select<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:47.909> take

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
there okay select that just gonna take

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.470 
there okay select that just gonna take
it<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.229> top<00:01:49.259> layer

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.150 

decrease<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.780> size<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:58.570> find<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.320> white

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.930

select that increase of Justice light be

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.790 
select that increase of Justice light be
a<00:02:06.970> little<00:02:07.300> bit<00:02:07.450> smaller<00:02:10.170> okay<00:02:13.260> babe<00:02:14.260> select
