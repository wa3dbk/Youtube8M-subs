hey everyone Sam BAM here and today
we're<00:00:02.580> gonna<00:00:02.700> talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.330> dribble<00:00:03.629> dance

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
we're gonna talk about the dribble dance

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.240 
we're gonna talk about the dribble dance
and<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.410> can<00:00:04.620> use<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.040> pick<00:00:05.160> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
and how you can use it in the pick and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.559 
and how you can use it in the pick and
roll<00:00:05.310> alright<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.029> when<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.210> first<00:00:06.359> started

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
roll alright so when I first started

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.179 
roll alright so when I first started
pick<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.839> roll<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.109> simply<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.710> dribble<00:00:08.099> my

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
pick and roll I simply just dribble my

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.009 
pick and roll I simply just dribble my
guy<00:00:08.340> into<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> pic<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.389> realized<00:00:09.809> that's

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
guy into the pic and I realized that's

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
guy into the pic and I realized that's
not<00:00:10.110> enough<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.889> must<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.309> him<00:00:11.580> off

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
not enough because I must get him off

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.100 
not enough because I must get him off
balance<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.269> us<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.480> also<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.809> big<00:00:12.960> man

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
balance for us and also the big man

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.110 
balance for us and also the big man
hedging<00:00:13.469> off<00:00:13.590> balance<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> realized<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
hedging off balance and I realized the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.609 
hedging off balance and I realized the
best<00:00:15.360> way<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.809> both<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.199> them<00:00:16.260> off<00:00:16.440> balance

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
best way to get both of them off balance

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.490 
best way to get both of them off balance
is<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.550> use<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> call<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.109> tribute<00:00:19.380> dance

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
is to use what I call the tribute dance

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.830 
is to use what I call the tribute dance
it<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> free<00:00:20.730> stuff<00:00:20.939> move<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it is a free stuff move the first to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660 
it is a free stuff move the first to
step<00:00:22.080> my<00:00:22.230> setups<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.369> step

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
step my setups and then the first step

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.490 
step my setups and then the first step
is<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> explosion<00:00:24.510> go<00:00:24.630> steps<00:00:24.930> okay<00:00:25.080> here's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is the explosion go steps okay here's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
is the explosion go steps okay here's
the<00:00:25.590> first<00:00:25.769> step<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> hold<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the first step you want to hold on a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.550 
the first step you want to hold on a
turbo<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.630> flick<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> right<00:00:28.109> stick<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
turbo and flick the right stick to the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
turbo and flick the right stick to the
left<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:28.920> right<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.699> introduce<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.660> hop

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
left or right this will introduce a hop

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.720 
left or right this will introduce a hop
this<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.800> baby<00:00:32.009> hob<00:00:32.309> will<00:00:32.489> get<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this little baby hob will get the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
this little baby hob will get the
defenders<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.270> balance<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.649> that's<00:00:34.829> turbo

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
defenders off balance so that's turbo

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.410 
defenders off balance so that's turbo
and<00:00:35.340> feckless<00:00:35.550> stick<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.880> left<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.210> now

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and feckless stick to left it right now

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the two moves either one first but the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.950 
the two moves either one first but the
important<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> between<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:45.809> moves

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
important thing is between the two moves

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
important thing is between the two moves
you<00:00:46.020> wanna<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.379> second<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
first step the first step is the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750 
first step the first step is the
explosion<00:00:51.809> step<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> escape<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
explosion step it's one you escape this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
explosion step it's one you escape this
is<00:00:53.879> extremely<00:00:54.449> important<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> time<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is extremely important for this time you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.360 
is extremely important for this time you
don't<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> rights<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> don't
