00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.050
 hi to all and axel of hostesses 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.169
 mobile.fr we are in 2014 on the 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.629
 alcatel one touch tcl stand that we 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.019
 presented several tablets whose 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.570
 pop 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.890
 8 but also the pop 7 which is the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.529
 7 inch model as its name indicated 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.179
 so a little bit below level 2 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.039
 at the level of its size 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.650
 it seems to me that's the logic 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.140
 then you have the body 1.3 gigahertz and a 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 cortex a7 n and 3g 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.580
 a priori wifi also a like the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.680
 most 7 inch 1024 tablets by 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.620
 600 1 gig of ram 4 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.410
 internal a microsd slot to increase 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.870
 all that a building a battery of 3240 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.840
 milliamps a camera 2 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.140
 megapixel on the back 0 3 megapixel to 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.600
 front 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.700
 that's it and looks a lot like the hall 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.660
 8.1 we saw we saw earlier 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.040
 with here a cover that gives him here 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.990
 who adds a little bit 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.280
 thickness here besides I do not take it off 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.930
 because I do not want to force but it's 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.220
 possible to remove it I do not know if these 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 covers will be offered elsewhere in 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.270
 attractive native at the exit of the box 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.700
 it could be cool so we're going 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.369
 look a little bit at the design there is to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.789
 the front camera nothing here apart from the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.789
 keys dedicated to handling 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:24.109
 interface here on off lock 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.899
 unlock and the microphone volume then to 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.700
 the e3 I let me see where is the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.950
 way card a priori it will remove the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 the cover to be able to put the card 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:40.130
 sim tech jack 3.5 micro usb or by their 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.630
 the camera well here I am doing little 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.200
 near the turn so we'll go see in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.329
 the interface what we reserve alcatel 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 something pretty basic one there we have 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.180
 all the notifications here here we have the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.750
 possibility to access some to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.939
 some cantons 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.119
 some high-level fast access 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.689
 settings that's supposed to be the menu 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.000
 main 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 yeah that's menu with all the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 applications is what we have in email 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:14.700
 jazz gallery facebook 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.590
 ok I feel like he's blocking a bit 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.799
 where is my finger bug that I press 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.970
 gallery he launched me facebook 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.319
 yeah I feel like there is a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.819
 tactical problem on this tablet 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.590
 so we will not necessarily linger 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.000
 but here it is you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.099
 do not worry if it's prototypes 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 usually on salons not always 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.819
 but in this case it seems 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 to be the case 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.060
 I do not know the price yet I know 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.410
 I do not have much information except 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.150
 the specs finally and the product in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.370
 as such this case that is already not bad 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.690
 but a priori it will be a tablet that 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.060
 will be offered not very very expensive 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.150
 since it is not extremely well 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.190
 equipped and I told you about the CPU or not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680
 yes this dual core i3 so that's not it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 necessarily a big one big chipset and 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 then in addition to the bugs so we will not 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.150
 to linger over me finally good this is it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.639
 it was for my little presentation of 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 the tablet has alcatel ocs 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.069
 2014 if you have any questions 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.069
 do not hesitate to see you soon
