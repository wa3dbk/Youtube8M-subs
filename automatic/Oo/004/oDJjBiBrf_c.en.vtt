noting<00:00:11.759> about<00:00:11.940> each<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.780> we'll<00:00:13.349> start

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
noting about each one so we'll start

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.890 
noting about each one so we'll start
with<00:00:13.650> blood<00:00:13.950> stone<00:00:14.219> dust<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.820> we'll<00:00:15.690> go

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
with blood stone dust and we'll go

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.670 
with blood stone dust and we'll go
through<00:00:15.929> refinement<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.330> we<00:00:18.330> as<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.500> do<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
through refinement as we as we can do a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.269 
through refinement as we as we can do a
refinement<00:00:20.130> let's<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.640> honest<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:22.279> blood

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
refinement let's be honest so blood

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
refinement let's be honest so blood
stone<00:00:23.519> dust<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.000> available<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.720> champion

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
stone dust is available from champion

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.150 
stone dust is available from champion
loot<00:00:25.619> bags<00:00:25.859> now<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.539> rarity<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.320> quality<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
loot bags now the rarity or quality of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.450 
loot bags now the rarity or quality of
the<00:00:29.250> loot<00:00:29.400> bag<00:00:29.580> does<00:00:29.910> seem<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> depend<00:00:30.510> on

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the loot bag does seem to depend on

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.389 
the loot bag does seem to depend on
whether<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> will<00:00:32.880> drop<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> dust<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
whether or not it will drop you dust so

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
whether or not it will drop you dust so
say<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.700> blue<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.090> green<00:00:36.570> champion<00:00:37.290> box<00:00:37.500> may

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
say a blue and green champion box may

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
say a blue and green champion box may
not<00:00:38.640> draw<00:00:38.940> people<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.360> stabbed<00:00:39.600> us<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.050> every

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
not draw people had stabbed us but every

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100 
not draw people had stabbed us but every
exotic<00:00:40.739> bag<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:41.070> had<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.399> far<00:00:41.430> has<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.780> blood

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
exotic bag I've had so far has had blood

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.580 
exotic bag I've had so far has had blood
stone<00:00:43.350> dust<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.539> they<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.600> drop<00:00:45.930> quite

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
stone dust in it and they do drop quite

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
stone dust in it and they do drop quite
a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> relatively<00:00:48.059> easy<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a lot so that's a relatively easy one to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.920 
a lot so that's a relatively easy one to
come<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.770> blood<00:00:50.039> stone<00:00:50.250> bricks<00:00:50.610> are

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.970 

that's<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.260> filtered<00:00:55.739> blood<00:00:56.129> stone<00:00:56.960> bricks

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
that's not filtered blood stone bricks

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
that's not filtered blood stone bricks
there<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.789> obsidian<00:01:00.120> refinement

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
there we go are an obsidian refinement

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
there we go are an obsidian refinement
this<00:01:01.020> means<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.530> need<00:01:01.710> obsidium

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
this means that they need obsidium

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.700 
this means that they need obsidium
shards<00:01:02.870> specifically<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
shards specifically to now these are

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
shards specifically to now these are
available<00:01:04.890> obviously<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> comma<00:01:06.119> via<00:01:07.049> Orion

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
available obviously by a comma via Orion

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.510

boxes or the super adventure box so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
boxes or the super adventure box so
there's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> few<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> few<00:01:13.439> ways<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> grab

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
there's a few there's a few ways to grab

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.670 
there's a few there's a few ways to grab
those<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.930> refine<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> need<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
those right now to refine you need a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.749 
those right now to refine you need a
hundred<00:01:17.040> dust<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.750> ten<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.619> new<00:01:19.920> ascended

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
hundred dust and ten of the new ascended

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
hundred dust and ten of the new ascended
region<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.420> we'll<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.229> little

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
region so we'll get to that a little

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.520 
region so we'll get to that a little
later<00:01:22.640> but<00:01:23.640> note<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> every<00:01:24.630> refinement<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
later but note that every refinement is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.480 
later but note that every refinement is
100<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.729> raw<00:01:27.689> too<00:01:28.229> refined<00:01:28.560> material<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
100 to one raw too refined material so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
100 to one raw too refined material so
you'll<00:01:29.700> need<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> hundred<00:01:30.450> dust<00:01:30.689> you'll<00:01:31.409> need<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you'll need a hundred dust you'll need a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
you'll need a hundred dust you'll need a
hundred<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.280> etc<00:01:33.210> etc<00:01:33.689> etc<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:36.229> crystalline<00:01:37.229> or

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hundred or etc etc etc so crystalline or

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.830 
hundred or etc etc etc so crystalline or
we<00:01:37.860> currently<00:01:38.430> cannot<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> no<00:01:39.540> idea

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
we currently cannot get we have no idea

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.450 
we currently cannot get we have no idea
where<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> might<00:01:40.770> come<00:01:40.920> from<00:01:40.979> that's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
where this might come from that's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.440 
where this might come from that's
probably<00:01:41.700> something<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
probably something to do with the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.100 
probably something to do with the
ascended<00:01:42.840> armor<00:01:43.340> or<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.750> precursor

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
ascended armor or maybe for precursor

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.510 
ascended armor or maybe for precursor
crafting<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.340> any

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
crafting so we don't have any

crafting so we don't have any
information<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.970> those<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.450> nothing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
information about those there's nothing
