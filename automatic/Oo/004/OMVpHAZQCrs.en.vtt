change the view to camera some reason I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.780 
change the view to camera some reason I
have<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.600> do<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.870> twice<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:58.370> going<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.550> zoom

bricks<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.990> could<00:03:03.470> add<00:03:03.590> them<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.010> camera

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.770 
bricks I could add them to the camera
but<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.790> think<00:03:04.970> I'll<00:03:05.090> add<00:03:05.239> them<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.690> the

empty which I rename game I'm going to

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.120 
empty which I rename game I'm going to
add<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.340> property<00:03:48.640> sensor<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.860> will

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
add a property sensor and that will

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.780 
add a property sensor and that will
sense<00:03:51.730> when<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.450> property<00:03:53.200> health<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.830> equal

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
sense when the property health is equal

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.320 
sense when the property health is equal
to<00:03:55.030> zero<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:57.340> will<00:03:57.459> then<00:03:57.670> send<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.120> signal

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
to zero it will then send a signal

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.910 
to zero it will then send a signal

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
straight to a NAND gate to a scene

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.690 
straight to a NAND gate to a scene
actuator<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:04.600> will<00:04:04.900> set<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.470> scene<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:06.490> be

actuator that will set the scene to be
the<00:04:07.300> death<00:04:07.780> scene<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:09.220> connect<00:04:09.520> that<00:04:09.640> up

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.100 

now<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.890> test<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.280> logic<00:04:17.430> brakes<00:04:18.110> just

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
now we can test the logic brakes just

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.280 
now we can test the logic brakes just
move<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.530> down<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> bit<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.540> start<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.110> game

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
move that down a bit and start the game

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.790 
move that down a bit and start the game
engine<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:23.630> walk<00:04:24.630> forward<00:04:24.960> into<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.320> cactus

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.690 
and my health is going down down down
down<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.540> health<00:04:30.720> reaches<00:04:31.560> zero<00:04:31.890> display
