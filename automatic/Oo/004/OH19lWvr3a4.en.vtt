look<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
look it up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
look it up
I<00:00:31.910> probably<00:00:32.910> too<00:00:33.239> lazy<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:35.149> it's<00:00:36.149> just

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I probably too lazy to do that it's just

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
I probably too lazy to do that it's just
it's<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> same<00:00:37.500> pretty<00:00:37.829> ugly<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's the same pretty ugly is just to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
it's the same pretty ugly is just to
repaint<00:00:39.719> nothing<00:00:40.649> different<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
repaint nothing different but I do

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.270 
repaint nothing different but I do
believe<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:43.020> colors<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.129> much

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
believe on the colors things pretty much

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.610 
believe on the colors things pretty much
the<00:00:44.430> same<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.360> there's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.379> black

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the same but there's a little more black

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
the same but there's a little more black
that's<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:47.850> much<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.780> does

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that's pretty much it but it does

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
that's pretty much it but it does
combine<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.649> another<00:00:49.920> figure<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.239> one

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
combine with another figure this one

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.990 
combine with another figure this one
does<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:54.020> breakdown<00:00:55.100> GTS<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.340> think

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.069 

does<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.180> combine<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.750> one

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
does not combine with this one

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
does not combine with this one
I<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> size<00:01:02.520> comparison

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I don't think here is a size comparison

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:13.160 
I don't think here is a size comparison
to<00:01:03.979> leader<00:01:04.979> class<00:01:05.280> Megatron<00:01:11.990> Megatron<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to leader class Megatron Megatron to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.700 
to leader class Megatron Megatron to
gigantic<00:01:13.680> compared<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:16.650> don't

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
gigantic compared to over I and I don't

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
gigantic compared to over I and I don't
know<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.549> accurate<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
know if this is you know accurate it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.179 
know if this is you know accurate it
probably<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:18.900> Megatron's<00:01:19.500> gigantic

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
probably is because Megatron's gigantic

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
probably is because Megatron's gigantic
what<00:01:21.030> I'll<00:01:21.210> expect<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.930> review<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.380> Megatron

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
what I'll expect a review from Megatron

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.450 
what I'll expect a review from Megatron
come<00:01:24.030> ceiling<00:01:26.990> here<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> another<00:01:29.040> size

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
come ceiling here is a another size

I<00:01:31.759> think<00:01:32.759> Walker<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> series<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I think Walker in the series was the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.620 
I think Walker in the series was the
same<00:01:34.710> size

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
same size

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
same size

like<00:06:26.740> this<00:06:26.980> you<00:06:27.280> could<00:06:27.460> probably<00:06:27.640> make<00:06:28.000> it

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
like this you could probably make it

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.500 
like this you could probably make it
around<00:06:29.560> but<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.670> probably<00:06:30.880> break<00:06:31.210> off<00:06:31.390> the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
around but you probably break off the

around but you probably break off the
leg

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069
