system<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:11.240> what<00:00:12.240> I'm<00:00:12.330> gonna<00:00:12.509> take<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> look<00:00:13.080> at

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
system so what I'm gonna take a look at

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.080 
system so what I'm gonna take a look at
this<00:00:13.530> time<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> cable<00:00:15.599> side<00:00:17.090> because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
this time is on the cable side because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.429 
this time is on the cable side because
I'm<00:00:18.359> quite<00:00:19.289> handy<00:00:19.680> myself<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:20.400> able<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
I'm quite handy myself so I'm able to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.240 
I'm quite handy myself so I'm able to
put<00:00:22.439> together<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:23.519> own<00:00:23.550> cables<00:00:25.220> typically<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
put together my own cables typically I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.390 
put together my own cables typically I
enjoy<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> nor<00:00:27.420> das<00:00:27.570> cables<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
enjoy the nor das cables and the kind of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.120 
enjoy the nor das cables and the kind of
cables<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.820> find<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.859> bit

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
cables I find a bit a bit a little bit

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.040 
cables I find a bit a bit a little bit
too<00:00:32.399> rich<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.059> warm<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.230> setup<00:00:34.559> here

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
too rich and warm for my setup here

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.319 
too rich and warm for my setup here
because<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> already<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> lot<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
because I already have a lot of a lot of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
because I already have a lot of a lot of
that<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> sound<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:43.129> cables

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that kind of sound I like to use cables

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.229 
that kind of sound I like to use cables
that<00:00:44.280> maybe<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:45.090> more

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that maybe are a little bit more

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
that maybe are a little bit more
transparent<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:45.930> I've<00:00:46.140> used<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.410> lot<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.710> lure<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
transparent so I've used a lot of lure a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
transparent so I've used a lot of lure a
switch<00:00:47.840> very<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.020> fast<00:00:49.320> high<00:00:50.039> speed<00:00:51.620> cables

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
switch very very fast high speed cables

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
switch very very fast high speed cables
and<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> I've<00:00:54.809> done<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.530> um<00:00:56.300> kimber<00:00:57.300> also

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and what I've done now is um kimber also

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
and what I've done now is um kimber also
makes<00:00:57.719> some<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.170> cables<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
makes some pretty good cables so what I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.039 
makes some pretty good cables so what I
decided<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.809> had<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.530> this

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
decided to do was I had a lot of this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.710 
decided to do was I had a lot of this
milspec<00:01:04.049> crowd<00:01:04.920> treated<00:01:05.720> silver-plated

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
milspec crowd treated silver-plated

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.920 
milspec crowd treated silver-plated
copper<00:01:07.040> lying<00:01:08.040> around<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
copper lying around because because I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
copper lying around because because I
used<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:11.010> own<00:01:11.130> cable<00:01:11.280> company<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
used to have my own cable company and I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
used to have my own cable company and I
used<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.840> build<00:01:13.260> my<00:01:13.470> own<00:01:13.500> cables<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
used to to build my own cables and you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.940 
used to to build my own cables and you
can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.909> here<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.080> still<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.560> some<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
can see here that I still have some of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
can see here that I still have some of
the<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> custom<00:01:18.450> made<00:01:18.600> stuff<00:01:18.930> work

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the some of the custom made stuff work

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
the some of the custom made stuff work
so<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.860> decided<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.570> pick<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.600> some<00:01:23.180> some<00:01:24.180> nerve

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so I decided to pick up some some nerve

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
so I decided to pick up some some nerve
Audio<00:01:25.310> dead<00:01:26.310> plugs<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:28.460> beryllium

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
Audio dead plugs these are beryllium

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
Audio dead plugs these are beryllium
plated<00:01:30.329> copper<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.930> believe<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.950> was

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
plated copper I believe there was

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
plated copper I believe there was
something<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.150> they're<00:01:33.810> super

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
something like that and they're super

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.010 
something like that and they're super
lightweight<00:01:34.619> they're<00:01:34.920> very<00:01:35.189> similar<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.410 

the<00:01:40.020> Zed<00:01:40.259> plugs<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.460> nor<00:01:41.640> das<00:01:41.790> uses<00:01:42.270> but

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the Zed plugs that that nor das uses but

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.429 
the Zed plugs that that nor das uses but
these<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> silver<00:01:43.829> plated<00:01:44.220> early<00:01:45.439> silver

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
these are the silver plated early silver

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.660 
these are the silver plated early silver
plate<00:01:46.649> brilliant<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
plate brilliant or something like that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
plate brilliant or something like that
so<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.509> pretty<00:01:48.990> good<00:01:49.079> stuff<00:01:49.380> there

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
so that's some pretty good stuff there

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.170 
so that's some pretty good stuff there
and<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.640> braiding<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and my braiding is not that good as you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.310 
and my braiding is not that good as you
can<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:56.540> uneven<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.170> go

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
can see it's a bit uneven as we go

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
can see it's a bit uneven as we go
through<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> braid<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:00.570> think

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
through the braid here but I don't think

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.530 
through the braid here but I don't think
that<00:02:00.960> should<00:02:01.110> affect<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.619> sound<00:02:01.799> too<00:02:02.130> much

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
that should affect the sound too much

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
that should affect the sound too much
and<00:02:03.540> since<00:02:04.409> these<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> Gershman

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and since these are the Gershman

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.050 
and since these are the Gershman

the<00:02:07.870> amp<00:02:08.190> feeds<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.740> subwoofer<00:02:11.740> unit<00:02:12.100> here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the amp feeds the subwoofer unit here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.760 
the amp feeds the subwoofer unit here
basically<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.120> then<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.780> output<00:02:14.170> comes<00:02:14.440> from

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
basically and then the output comes from

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.610 
basically and then the output comes from
the<00:02:14.890> top<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.280> subwoofer<00:02:15.580> unit<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.620> into

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the top of the subwoofer unit and into

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.720 
the top of the subwoofer unit and into

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
here

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.110 
here
I<00:02:18.760> didn't<00:02:19.750> buy<00:02:19.930> wire<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.440> ones<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.250> decided

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
I didn't buy wire these ones I decided

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300 
I didn't buy wire these ones I decided
to<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.600> was<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.050> use<00:02:23.170> jumpers<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.800> in

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
to I was going to use jumpers but in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.720 
to I was going to use jumpers but in
this<00:02:24.670> case<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.420> standard<00:02:25.780> brass

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this case I have the standard brass

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
this case I have the standard brass
jumpers<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.880> there<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.300> actually<00:02:29.230> built<00:02:29.650> some

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
jumpers in there I actually built some

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.580 
jumpers in there I actually built some
jumpers<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.490> they<00:02:31.270> didn't<00:02:31.600> they<00:02:32.440> weren't

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
jumpers but they didn't they weren't

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380 
jumpers but they didn't they weren't
quite<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:32.830> flexible<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.550> I'd<00:02:33.700> hoped<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> had

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
quite as flexible as I'd hoped so I had

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
quite as flexible as I'd hoped so I had
to<00:02:34.800> rethink<00:02:35.800> um<00:02:36.040> doing<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.810> might<00:02:38.380> pick<00:02:38.830> up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
to rethink um doing that I might pick up

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.180 
to rethink um doing that I might pick up
a<00:02:39.160> card<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.489> solid<00:02:39.850> copper<00:02:40.180> jumpers<00:02:40.540> like<00:02:41.190> like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
a card a solid copper jumpers like like

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
it tends to pick up a lot of noise but I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.750 
it tends to pick up a lot of noise but I
found<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.170> switching<00:03:30.100> between<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.730> and

found that switching between that and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.940 
found that switching between that and
the<00:03:31.030> heimdal<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.720> have<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.350> which<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.799> a

the heimdal that I have here which is a

dost that that it didn't really make a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.520 
dost that that it didn't really make a
huge<00:03:39.700> amount<00:03:40.570> of<00:03:40.720> difference<00:03:41.110> as<00:03:41.290> far<00:03:41.320> as

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
huge amount of difference as far as

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.729 
huge amount of difference as far as
picking<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.010> noise<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.019> I've<00:03:44.019> kept<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> red

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
picking up noise so I've kept the red

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.160 
picking up noise so I've kept the red
down<00:03:44.920> here<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.579> might<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> switch<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.900> I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
down here that might be a switch that I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.710 
down here that might be a switch that I
will<00:03:47.590> do<00:03:47.769> along<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.250> lines<00:03:48.459> neck<00:03:49.329> for<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.570> while

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
will do along the lines neck for a while

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.650 
will do along the lines neck for a while
here<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.310> as<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.549> can<00:03:51.640> see<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.299> mention

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
here so as you can see the to mention

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.229 
here so as you can see the to mention
the<00:03:52.780> heimdal<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:54.190> up<00:03:54.370> behind<00:03:54.730> all<00:03:54.940> going

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the heimdal here and up behind all going

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.610 
the heimdal here and up behind all going
down<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:56.519> here<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.930> a<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> again<00:04:02.380> one

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
down and here is a this is a again one

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.880 
down and here is a this is a again one
of<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.850> cables<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.299> built<00:04:04.570> here<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.410> this<00:04:05.769> is

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
of the cables I built here and this is

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.310 
of the cables I built here and this is
also<00:04:06.070> using<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.030> same<00:04:07.239> similar<00:04:07.900> braiding

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
also using the same similar braiding

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.590 
also using the same similar braiding
technique<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:08.950> used<00:04:09.250> on<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.239> speaker

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
technique that I used on the speaker

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.069 
technique that I used on the speaker
cables<00:04:10.959> which<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:12.630> 10-10-10<00:04:13.630> wire<00:04:13.810> braid

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
cables which is a 10-10-10 wire braid

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.370 
cables which is a 10-10-10 wire braid
five<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.680> each<00:04:14.760> pole<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.510> one<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> ten<00:04:17.200> wire

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
five on each pole this one is a ten wire

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.909 
five on each pole this one is a ten wire
braid<00:04:17.680> also

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
braid also

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.860 
braid also
but<00:04:19.129> but<00:04:19.519> a<00:04:19.549> much<00:04:19.759> smaller<00:04:20.060> gauge<00:04:20.269> wire<00:04:20.509> the

the wire on the speaker cables is I

the wire on the speaker cables is I
think<00:04:23.509> I<00:04:23.689> believe<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:24.939> 18<00:04:25.939> gauge<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:27.430> this

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
think I believe is 18 gauge and this

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.300 
think I believe is 18 gauge and this
wire<00:04:28.669> here<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.860> each<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.009> them<00:04:31.129> is

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
wire here is is each of them is

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.570 
wire here is is each of them is
approximately<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:33.050> believe<00:04:34.009> 20<00:04:34.789> 28<00:04:35.449> gauge<00:04:35.810> or

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
approximately I believe 20 28 gauge or

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.330 
approximately I believe 20 28 gauge or
26<00:04:37.580> gauge<00:04:37.849> something<00:04:38.240> along<00:04:38.419> those<00:04:38.599> lines<00:04:38.689> and

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
26 gauge something along those lines and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.540 
26 gauge something along those lines and
it's<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.479> is<00:04:41.599> a<00:04:41.629> solid<00:04:42.050> core<00:04:42.340> 28<00:04:43.340> gauge

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
it's a this one is a solid core 28 gauge

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.360 
it's a this one is a solid core 28 gauge
cable<00:04:43.819> and<00:04:44.379> five<00:04:45.379> on<00:04:45.529> each<00:04:45.590> Pole<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.159> it

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
cable and five on each Pole and it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.800 
cable and five on each Pole and it
sounds<00:04:46.610> really<00:04:46.639> good<00:04:46.849> I'm<00:04:47.360> really<00:04:47.389> quite

sounds really good I'm really quite
happy<00:04:48.169> with<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.439> way<00:04:48.529> that<00:04:48.710> one<00:04:48.889> sounds<00:04:49.310> down

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
happy with the way that one sounds down

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.350 
happy with the way that one sounds down
here<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:52.370> one<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:52.729> another<00:04:52.969> one<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:53.270> my

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
here this one here another one of my

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.559 
here this one here another one of my
cables<00:04:54.580> well<00:04:55.580> not<00:04:55.729> really<00:04:55.879> actually<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.360> one

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
cables well not really actually this one

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.360

answers<00:05:03.319> same<00:05:03.979> place<00:05:04.159> I<00:05:04.310> picked<00:05:04.490> up<00:05:04.669> those

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
answers same place I picked up those

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.300 
answers same place I picked up those
nerve<00:05:05.659> audio<00:05:06.020> things<00:05:06.469> I<00:05:06.650> think<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.949> believe<00:05:07.099> in

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
nerve audio things I think I believe in

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.890 
nerve audio things I think I believe in
nerve<00:05:07.490> audio<00:05:07.819> is<00:05:07.879> one<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.180> their<00:05:08.270> own<00:05:08.419> their

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
nerve audio is one of their own their

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.829 
nerve audio is one of their own their
own<00:05:09.050> companies<00:05:09.529> so<00:05:10.069> yeah<00:05:10.279> this<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:11.449> uses

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:11.839 
own companies so yeah this this uses

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.740 
own companies so yeah this this uses
some<00:05:12.199> some<00:05:12.529> can't<00:05:13.219> really<00:05:13.370> see<00:05:13.639> it<00:05:13.699> here<00:05:13.969> CMC

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
some some can't really see it here CMC

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.619 
some some can't really see it here CMC
RCA<00:05:15.259> connectors<00:05:15.860> walking<00:05:16.669> ones<00:05:16.879> so<00:05:17.360> it's<00:05:17.449> hard

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
RCA connectors walking ones so it's hard

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.579 
RCA connectors walking ones so it's hard
to<00:05:17.659> pull<00:05:17.900> out<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:20.589> synergistic

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
to pull out and this synergistic

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.050 
to pull out and this synergistic
research<00:05:22.099> cable<00:05:22.460> which<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.699> really<00:05:22.939> good

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
research cable which is really good

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.929 
research cable which is really good
actually<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.509> quite<00:05:23.870> like<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.110> cable<00:05:24.939> back

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
actually I quite like the cable back

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:29.200 
actually I quite like the cable back
over<00:05:26.330> here<00:05:27.069> connecting<00:05:28.069> the<00:05:28.310> output<00:05:28.759> from<00:05:29.089> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
over here connecting the output from the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.200 
over here connecting the output from the
preamp<00:05:29.569> to<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.589> amplifiers<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.610> have<00:05:32.060> the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
preamp to the the amplifiers I have the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.179 
preamp to the the amplifiers I have the
nor<00:05:32.389> das<00:05:32.569> fray<00:05:32.930> as<00:05:33.349> you<00:05:33.620> can<00:05:33.740> see<00:05:33.889> it's<00:05:34.069> the

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
nor das fray as you can see it's the

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.269 
nor das fray as you can see it's the
green<00:05:34.460> ones<00:05:34.879> on<00:05:35.210> to<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.449> demo<00:05:35.629> cable<00:05:36.279> this

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
green ones on to the demo cable this

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.550 
green ones on to the demo cable this
one's<00:05:37.490> also<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.759> locking<00:05:38.120> cable<00:05:38.270> but<00:05:38.629> so<00:05:39.469> you

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
one's also a locking cable but so you

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.929 
one's also a locking cable but so you
can<00:05:39.680> use<00:05:39.830> see<00:05:40.550> it<00:05:40.639> uses<00:05:40.819> the<00:05:41.409> WBT<00:05:43.750> next-gen

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
can use see it uses the WBT next-gen

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.269 
can use see it uses the WBT next-gen
copper<00:05:47.319> next-gen<00:05:48.319> copper<00:05:48.710> connectors<00:05:48.979> the

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:49.279 
copper next-gen copper connectors the

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.659 
copper next-gen copper connectors the
lightweight<00:05:49.639> one<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:50.740> all<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.919> power<00:05:52.129> cables

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
lightweight one and all the power cables

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.510 
lightweight one and all the power cables
are<00:05:52.909> of<00:05:53.149> my<00:05:53.389> own<00:05:53.539> design

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
are of my own design

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.929 
are of my own design
using<00:05:55.520> various<00:05:56.229> ie<00:05:57.229> C's<00:05:57.589> and<00:05:57.939> hospital-grade

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
using various ie C's and hospital-grade

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.149 
using various ie C's and hospital-grade
connectors<00:05:59.539> so<00:06:00.439> you<00:06:00.500> can<00:06:00.649> see<00:06:00.830> some<00:06:01.009> of<00:06:01.039> these

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
connectors so you can see some of these

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.740 
connectors so you can see some of these
are<00:06:01.839> ginormous<00:06:03.099> just<00:06:04.099> because<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.759> wanted<00:06:05.689> to

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
are ginormous just because I wanted to

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.019 
are ginormous just because I wanted to
make<00:06:06.259> them<00:06:06.469> look<00:06:06.589> ginormous<00:06:06.830> they're<00:06:07.430> pretty

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
make them look ginormous they're pretty

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.779 
make them look ginormous they're pretty
much<00:06:08.240> our<00:06:08.419> regular<00:06:08.839> I<00:06:09.310> wasn't<00:06:10.310> regular<00:06:10.610> but

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
much our regular I wasn't regular but

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.999 
much our regular I wasn't regular but
pretty<00:06:11.270> much<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.479> regular<00:06:11.810> sized<00:06:12.319> cable<00:06:12.919> at

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
pretty much a regular sized cable at

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.689 
pretty much a regular sized cable at
least<00:06:13.189> underneath<00:06:14.120> here<00:06:14.360> a<00:06:15.399> few<00:06:16.399> different

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
least underneath here a few different

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.149 
least underneath here a few different
designs<00:06:16.819> and<00:06:17.180> I've<00:06:17.330> tried<00:06:17.539> out<00:06:17.750> but<00:06:18.560> this<00:06:18.919> one

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
designs and I've tried out but this one

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.290 
designs and I've tried out but this one
is<00:06:19.279> a<00:06:19.310> fat<00:06:19.879> chunky<00:06:20.649> overlay<00:06:21.649> on<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:21.979> so<00:06:22.789> I<00:06:23.180> just

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
is a fat chunky overlay on it so I just

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.959 
is a fat chunky overlay on it so I just
wanted<00:06:23.689> to<00:06:23.750> impress<00:06:24.500> some<00:06:25.009> friends<00:06:25.430> and

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
wanted to impress some friends and

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.690 
wanted to impress some friends and
whatnot<00:06:26.149> so<00:06:26.839> I<00:06:27.019> give<00:06:27.800> an<00:06:27.919> extra<00:06:28.339> jacket

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
whatnot so I give an extra jacket

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.550 
whatnot so I give an extra jacket
most<00:06:30.000> of<00:06:30.150> them<00:06:30.270> are<00:06:30.390> more<00:06:30.600> along<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:31.020> lines<00:06:31.380> of

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
most of them are more along the lines of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.680 
most of them are more along the lines of
this<00:06:31.650> in<00:06:32.190> terms<00:06:32.370> of<00:06:32.550> sizing<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:35.420> that's<00:06:36.420> pretty

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
this in terms of sizing so that's pretty

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.070 
this in terms of sizing so that's pretty
much<00:06:36.870> it<00:06:37.080> for<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.350> cabling<00:06:37.710> here

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
much it for the cabling here

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.590 
much it for the cabling here
so<00:06:40.080> yeah<00:06:40.770> I<00:06:40.800> hope<00:06:40.980> you<00:06:41.070> guys<00:06:41.450> found<00:06:42.450> this
