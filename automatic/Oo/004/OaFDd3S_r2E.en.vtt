00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
really tell but it's just like really

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.330 
really tell but it's just like really
bright<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.360> really<00:02:21.720> me<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:23.070> lime

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
bright like it's really me on like lime

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.710

green<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.180> makes<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> look<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
green it kind of makes you look like a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.030 
green it kind of makes you look like a
traffic<00:02:25.140> code<00:02:25.320> if<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> wear<00:02:25.740> them<00:02:25.860> together

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
traffic code if you wear them together

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.580 
so that's kind of why I'd wear them
separately

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
