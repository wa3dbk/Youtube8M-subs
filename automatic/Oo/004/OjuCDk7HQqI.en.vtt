been a peak causing a major problems
gonna<00:01:17.040> float<00:01:17.400> downstairs<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.170> gonna

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gonna float downstairs all this is gonna

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460 
gonna float downstairs all this is gonna
be<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> problem<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.210> easy<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> stop

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
be a problem so the easy way to stop

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.550 
be a problem so the easy way to stop
this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> find<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.299> source<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this is you have to find the source and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
this is you have to find the source and
stop<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:28.009> let's<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.520> ahead<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
stop it so let's just go ahead and and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
stop it so let's just go ahead and and
try<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> click<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
try to click on this but if you do this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
try to click on this but if you do this
where<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> source<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:33.990> now

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
where the source was that you just now

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
where the source was that you just now
put<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> water<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.850> first<00:01:36.060> floor

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
put the water down on your first floor

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
put the water down on your first floor
so<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.590> better<00:01:37.829> way<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.180> find

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so the better way to do this is to find

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.260 
so the better way to do this is to find
that<00:01:39.780> source<00:01:40.200> stone<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.909> another

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that source stone and just put another

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.139 
that source stone and just put another
stone<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.930> top<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> stop<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.220> flow<00:01:47.149> okay

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
stone on top of it to stop the flow okay

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
stone on top of it to stop the flow okay
well<00:01:48.299> shows<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.259> oh<00:01:49.439> you

bucket<00:03:25.940> oh<00:03:26.150> look<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.019> that's<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.919> much

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
bucket oh look at that that's a much

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.339 
bucket oh look at that that's a much
easier<00:03:28.280> way<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.730> do<00:03:29.000> it

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
easier way to do it

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.500 
easier way to do it
so<00:03:30.980> my<00:03:31.190> four-year-old<00:03:31.609> just<00:03:31.910> figure<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.209> much

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
so my four-year-old just figure out much

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.180 
so my four-year-old just figure out much
easier<00:03:32.540> way<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.079> do<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.379> than<00:03:33.530> what<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:33.799> show

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
easier way to do it than what I do show

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.400 
easier way to do it than what I do show
yourself<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.329> just<00:03:35.359> give<00:03:35.720> me<00:03:35.750> these<00:03:35.900> two

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
yourself you just give me these two

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.550 
yourself you just give me these two
methods<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.340> stop<00:03:37.819> water<00:03:38.660> flow<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.440> use

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
methods to stop water flow you can use

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.710 
methods to stop water flow you can use
my<00:03:39.799> complicated<00:03:40.519> method<00:03:40.849> or<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.540> could<00:03:41.690> just

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
my complicated method or you could just

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.379 
my complicated method or you could just
use<00:03:41.959> Jax's<00:03:42.560> very<00:03:42.769> simple<00:03:43.190> method<00:03:46.030> okay<00:03:47.030> well

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
use Jax's very simple method okay well

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.109 
use Jax's very simple method okay well
we'll<00:03:47.540> see<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.720> next<00:03:47.930> time
