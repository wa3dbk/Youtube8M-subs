doors on and I've made these hinges so
how<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.120> those<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.840> get<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.050> piece<00:03:19.560> of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
how to do those is just get a piece of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:33.880 
how to do those is just get a piece of
paper<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.820> part<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:22.280> fold<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:23.610> half<00:03:27.950> okay

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.470 

so<00:03:34.890> fold<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.730> half<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.410> mean<00:03:38.480> place

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so fold it in half like that mean place

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.180 
so fold it in half like that mean place
it<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.780> inside<00:03:40.310> after<00:03:41.310> work<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:42.110> and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
it on the inside after work right and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.650 
it on the inside after work right and
what<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.310> want<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.610> now<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.060> fold<00:03:45.540> it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
what you want to do now is just fold it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.470 
what you want to do now is just fold it
back<00:03:45.900> again<00:03:46.970> over<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.140> ridge<00:03:49.140> near<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.940> then

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
back again over the ridge near and then

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.699 
back again over the ridge near and then
you<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.780> need<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.140> fold<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.620> back<00:03:52.860> again<00:03:57.709> so

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
you just need to fold it back again so

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.750 
you just need to fold it back again so
basically<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.489> looks<00:03:59.670> like<00:04:00.060> they're<00:04:01.760> okay

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760
