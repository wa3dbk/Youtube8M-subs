example of how to do Square Foot

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.099 
example of how to do Square Foot
Gardening<00:00:04.700> so<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:06.000> one<00:00:06.240> square<00:00:06.569> foot<00:00:06.810> here

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
Gardening so I have one square foot here

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.919 
Gardening so I have one square foot here
that<00:00:07.379> has<00:00:07.529> nothing<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.599> it's<00:00:09.599> next<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
that has nothing in it and it's next to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
that has nothing in it and it's next to
a<00:00:09.990> tomato<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.710> since<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.340> next<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
a tomato and since it's next to the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.270 
a tomato and since it's next to the
tomatoes<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.599> there's<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.259> trellis<00:00:13.769> support

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
tomatoes and there's a trellis support

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.220 
tomatoes and there's a trellis support
system<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.940> wanted<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> put<00:00:15.870> something<00:00:16.080> here

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
system I wanted to put something here

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
system I wanted to put something here
that<00:00:16.560> would<00:00:16.710> trellis<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:20.369> using<00:00:23.390> sugar

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
that would trellis so I'm using sugar

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.519 
that would trellis so I'm using sugar
snap<00:00:24.720> peas<00:00:26.420> it<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.570> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> last<00:00:27.960> minute<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
snap peas it was kind of last minute I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
snap peas it was kind of last minute I
probably<00:00:28.890> would<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.130> got<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> me<00:00:29.609> maybe<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
probably would have got it me maybe a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
probably would have got it me maybe a
different<00:00:30.390> variety<00:00:30.949> may<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.160> organic

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
different variety may be an organic

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.080 
different variety may be an organic
variety<00:00:33.469> but<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.739> good<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.760> gonna<00:00:35.940> be

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
variety but it's all good it's gonna be

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
variety but it's all good it's gonna be
way<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.329> organic<00:00:36.930> than<00:00:37.079> any<00:00:37.230> commercially

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
way more organic than any commercially

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
way more organic than any commercially
grown<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.760> pesticides<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.899> junk

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
grown with pesticides and all that junk

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
grown with pesticides and all that junk
on<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.730> gonna<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.969> better<00:00:42.149> anyways

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
on it so it's gonna be better anyways

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
on it so it's gonna be better anyways
alright<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> works<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
alright so how it works is you have a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.029 
alright so how it works is you have a
square<00:00:44.760> foot<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.320> plant<00:00:46.620> more<00:00:46.860> in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
square foot and you can plant more in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
square foot and you can plant more in
here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.059> another<00:00:48.270> video<00:00:48.710> because

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
here and that's in another video because

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.310 
here and that's in another video because
of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> soil<00:00:50.219> system<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.180> irrigation<00:00:51.690> system

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
of the soil system the irrigation system

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
of the soil system the irrigation system
and<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> lack<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.820> weeds<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.629> steal<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and the lack of weeds that steal the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
and the lack of weeds that steal the
nutrients<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> plant<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.340> can

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
nutrients from the plant so you can

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.500 
nutrients from the plant so you can
plant<00:00:57.390> differently<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.879> works<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
plant differently so that works as this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.160 
plant differently so that works as this
says<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> depth<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> 2<00:01:02.520> inches<00:01:02.879> thin<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> 6

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
says so to a depth of 2 inches thin to 6

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
says so to a depth of 2 inches thin to 6
inches<00:01:05.570> harvest<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:07.760> 70<00:01:08.760> days<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.750> average

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
inches harvest in 70 days so an average

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
inches harvest in 70 days so an average
soil<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> full<00:01:10.710> Sun<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.729> full<00:01:11.909> Sun<00:01:12.090> right

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
soil in full Sun we have full Sun right

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
soil in full Sun we have full Sun right
now<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:13.680> late<00:01:14.689> summer<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> full<00:01:16.259> crop<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
now in late summer for a full crop so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.510 
now in late summer for a full crop so
seeds<00:01:17.040> 2<00:01:17.310> inches<00:01:17.700> apart<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.740> double<00:01:19.740> rows<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
seeds 2 inches apart and double rows so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090 
seeds 2 inches apart and double rows so
they<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.780> inches<00:01:22.080> apart<00:01:22.259> now

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
they want you so two inches apart now

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
they want you so two inches apart now
here's<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> traditional<00:01:24.299> garden

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here's where the traditional garden

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.990 
here's where the traditional garden
waste<00:01:24.840> seeds<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> normally<00:01:26.700> do

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
waste seeds because what you normally do

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
waste seeds because what you normally do
is<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.420> sew<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:28.020> inches<00:01:28.320> apart

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is you would sew this two inches apart

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
is you would sew this two inches apart
then<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.390> four<00:01:30.689> inches<00:01:30.960> tall

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
then when these get to four inches tall

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.130 
then when these get to four inches tall
or<00:01:31.229> whatever<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> package<00:01:32.490> says<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.810> thin

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
or whatever the package says you thin

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
or whatever the package says you thin
them<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.710> six<00:01:34.979> inches<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> hole

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
them to six inches so if you have a hole

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.450 
them to six inches so if you have a hole
if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> plant<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> whole<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:40.460> every

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
if you plant this whole thing every

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
if you plant this whole thing every
other<00:01:41.670> P<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.600> gonna<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.869> yanking<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
other P you're gonna be yanking out and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.520 
other P you're gonna be yanking out and
that's<00:01:44.280> food<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.090> wasting<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that's food that's just wasting so in a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
that's food that's just wasting so in a
square<00:01:46.799> foot<00:01:47.040> gardening<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.820> no

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
square foot gardening there is no

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.100 
square foot gardening there is no
thinning<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.680> never<00:01:50.070> waste<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.610> seed

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
thinning so you never waste a seed

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.389 
thinning so you never waste a seed
that's<00:01:52.110> what<00:01:52.500> cool<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:53.070> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that's what cool about it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.030 
that's what cool about it
so<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> thin

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so how you do it is you use the thin

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
so how you do it is you use the thin
number<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.390> two<00:01:57.840> inches<00:01:58.110> apart

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
number you don't do the two inches apart

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
number you don't do the two inches apart
you<00:01:59.189> find<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.759> where<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.090> thin<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you find how where you thin it to and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
you find how where you thin it to and
that's<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> number<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.799> six<00:02:02.130> inches

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that's the number you go by six inches

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.899 
that's the number you go by six inches
and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.299> formula<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:04.619> use

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
and then there's a little formula to use

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
and then there's a little formula to use
and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.360> there's<00:02:06.509> sort<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> two<00:02:06.810> different

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and then there's sort of two different

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800 
and then there's sort of two different
formulas<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.239> trellising

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
formulas because if you're trellising

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.190 
formulas because if you're trellising
it's<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.289> different

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.220 

sorry<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> saw<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> strawberries<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.230> what

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
sorry I saw the strawberries so what

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.200 
sorry I saw the strawberries so what
we're<00:02:19.350> gonna<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> grid<00:02:21.120> that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
we're gonna do is you have a grid that

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.030 
we're gonna do is you have a grid that
the<00:02:21.330> whole<00:02:21.480> bed<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> grid<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.890> how<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the whole bed is a grid and then how you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.950 
the whole bed is a grid and then how you
plant<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.970> break<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.360> down<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.570> even

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
plant is you break it down to even

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.800 
plant is you break it down to even
further<00:02:25.230> grids<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.340> Tomatoes<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.480> per

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
further grids so Tomatoes is one per

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.530 
further grids so Tomatoes is one per
grid<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.490> lettuce<00:02:30.000> over<00:02:30.300> here

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
grid but you get like lettuce over here

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.390 
grid but you get like lettuce over here
and<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.880> instance<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.360> lettuce<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:34.190> four<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and for instance this lettuce is four to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.300 
and for instance this lettuce is four to
a<00:02:35.430> grid<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:38.450> draw<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.720> line<00:02:40.050> there<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.160> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
a grid so you draw a line there and you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.550 
a grid so you draw a line there and you
have<00:02:41.490> grid<00:02:41.820> square<00:02:42.780> square<00:02:43.140> square<00:02:43.170> square

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
have grid square square square square

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.640 
have grid square square square square
and<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.520> plant<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:46.230> one's<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and you plant in there this one's the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.560 
and you plant in there this one's the
same<00:02:46.860> way<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.730> draw<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> line<00:02:48.180> down<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.450> middle

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
same way you draw a line down the middle

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.620 
same way you draw a line down the middle
down<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.410> one<00:02:49.830> two<00:02:50.130> three<00:02:50.520> four<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> some

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
down there one two three four and some

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.230 
down there one two three four and some
of<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.840> are<00:02:51.930> six<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:52.560> right<00:02:52.680> here<00:02:52.830> six

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
of them are six this one right here six

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.860 
of them are six this one right here six
you'll<00:02:54.240> see<00:02:54.890> get<00:02:55.890> two<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.430> got<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.450> line<00:02:57.840> here

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you'll see get two it's got a line here

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.730 
you'll see get two it's got a line here
a<00:02:58.440> line<00:02:58.890> here<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.460> two<00:03:00.060> lines<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:01.260> so

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
a line here and two lines like that so

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560 
a line here and two lines like that so
it<00:03:01.830> actually<00:03:02.100> forms<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.670> two<00:03:02.910> three<00:03:03.270> four

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
it actually forms one two three four

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.020 
it actually forms one two three four
five<00:03:03.870> six<00:03:04.170> seven<00:03:04.560> eight<00:03:04.740> nine<00:03:04.800> that's<00:03:05.670> nine

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
five six seven eight nine that's nine

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.890 
five six seven eight nine that's nine
lettuce<00:03:06.570> right<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.190> see<00:03:08.900> how

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
lettuce right here so you can see how

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
lettuce right here so you can see how
you<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.230> grow<00:03:10.380> more<00:03:10.680> all<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.970> we're

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you can grow more all right so we're

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.840 
you can grow more all right so we're
gonna<00:03:12.180> do<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:13.740> plant<00:03:13.980> these<00:03:14.160> we're<00:03:14.760> gonna

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
gonna do is to plant these we're gonna

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.790 
gonna do is to plant these we're gonna
do<00:03:15.090> draw<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> grid<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:16.650> we're

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
do draw a grid and because we're

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.979 
do draw a grid and because we're
trellising<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> we're<00:03:18.270> gonna<00:03:18.420> plant<00:03:18.660> four

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
trellising it we're gonna plant four

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:19.780 
trellising it we're gonna plant four
beans

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
beans

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.220 
beans
we're<00:03:20.790> gonna<00:03:20.910> put<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:21.989> one

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
we're gonna put one here one here one

normally with this number sort of six
inches<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:29.190> can<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.520> sew<00:03:29.850> two<00:03:29.910> more<00:03:30.360> if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
inches you can actually sew two more if

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.890 
inches you can actually sew two more if
it<00:03:30.780> was<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> normal<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> lettuce<00:03:33.090> but

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it was a normal like a lettuce but

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.479 
it was a normal like a lettuce but
because<00:03:34.290> we're<00:03:34.470> gonna<00:03:34.620> Travis<00:03:35.010> them<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.310> want

to get them in the center so they'll hit

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.340 
to get them in the center so they'll hit
the<00:03:37.080> strings<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:40.010> let's<00:03:41.010> go<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:42.350> tripod
