we will discuss some of the tools that

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.200 
we will discuss some of the tools that
will<00:01:00.830> help<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.100> construct<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.820> bench<00:01:02.000> work

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
will help you construct the bench work

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.140 
will help you construct the bench work
easily<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.870> safely<00:01:03.220> we'll<00:01:04.220> assume<00:01:04.520> that<00:01:04.790> you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
easily and safely we'll assume that you

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:16.350 
easily and safely we'll assume that you
have<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> basic<00:01:05.750> knowledge<00:01:06.080> of<00:01:06.350> safe<00:01:06.620> tool<00:01:06.920> use

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.760 

we'll<00:01:17.360> show<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.600> how<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.870> correctly<00:01:18.380> measure

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
we'll show you how to correctly measure

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.040 
we'll show you how to correctly measure
and<00:01:19.040> cut<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.310> wood<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:20.210> save<00:01:20.450> time<00:01:20.810> and

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
and cut the wood to save time and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.620 
and cut the wood to save time and
materials<00:01:27.220> then<00:01:28.220> we'll<00:01:29.000> describe<00:01:29.360> how<00:01:29.570> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
materials then we'll describe how to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.480 
materials then we'll describe how to
build<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> leg<00:01:30.170> assemblies<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.340> they're

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
build the leg assemblies so they're

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:42.219 
build the leg assemblies so they're
square<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.090> level<00:01:40.390> once<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.570> assemblies<00:01:42.080> are

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
square and level once the assemblies are

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.440 
square and level once the assemblies are
completed<00:01:42.740> for<00:01:42.979> one<00:01:43.160> module<00:01:43.610> we'll<00:01:44.270> begin

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
completed for one module we'll begin

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.620 
completed for one module we'll begin
construction<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.619> L<00:01:45.770> girders<00:01:46.250> then<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
construction of the L girders then the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.210 
construction of the L girders then the
more<00:01:47.810> difficult<00:01:48.050> part<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.680> joining<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
more difficult part of joining the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.310 
more difficult part of joining the
modules<00:01:49.610> together<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:50.300> be<00:01:50.420> covered<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
modules together will be covered so the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.620 
modules together will be covered so the
job<00:01:51.530> will<00:01:51.680> seem<00:01:51.890> much<00:01:52.100> easier<00:01:52.550> we'll<00:01:53.300> make<00:01:53.479> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
job will seem much easier we'll make the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.310 
job will seem much easier we'll make the
layout<00:01:53.780> more<00:01:54.200> portable<00:01:54.710> by<00:01:54.860> adding<00:01:55.190> casters

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
layout more portable by adding casters

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.109 
layout more portable by adding casters
next<00:01:57.320> we'll<00:01:57.710> attach<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.340> ella<00:01:58.520> girders<00:01:58.910> to

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
next we'll attach the ella girders to

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.230 
next we'll attach the ella girders to
the<00:01:59.509> leg<00:01:59.660> assemblies<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:01.400> supplies<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.119> will
