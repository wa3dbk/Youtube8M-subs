feel it with this and you also feel it
with<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> slugs<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.870> definitely<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:59.160> next

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
with the slugs so definitely my next

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
with the slugs so definitely my next
investment<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> knox

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
investment is going to be the knox

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
investment is going to be the knox
pecker<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.460> stock<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.809> claim

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
pecker up stock they do claim

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
pecker up stock they do claim
ninety-five<00:01:05.790> percent<00:01:06.000> reduction<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
ninety-five percent reduction in the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.280 
ninety-five percent reduction in the
recoil<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.330> kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> doubt<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:10.140> much

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
recoil I kind of doubt that very much

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
recoil I kind of doubt that very much
however<00:01:10.710> i've<00:01:11.100> used<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.570> tried<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.200> at

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
however i've used one I've tried it at

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
however i've used one I've tried it at
the<00:01:13.409> gun<00:01:13.619> range<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.670> feel<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.420> less

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the gun range and you do feel a lot less

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
the gun range and you do feel a lot less
so<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.979> next<00:01:17.220> investment<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.970> goes<00:01:18.210> for

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so my next investment that goes for

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.520 
so my next investment that goes for
about<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.770> hundred<00:01:19.890> forty<00:01:20.310> five<00:01:20.610> dollars<00:01:21.530> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
about one hundred forty five dollars so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.649 
about one hundred forty five dollars so
I'm<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.040> investing<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.240> that's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I'm going to be investing in that that's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.130 
I'm going to be investing in that that's
my<00:01:24.869> next<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.369> also<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.759> tactical<00:01:27.630> carry
