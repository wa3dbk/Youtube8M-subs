of the episode 5 50 I listened for like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.170 
of the episode 5 50 I listened for like
40<00:01:15.770> k<00:01:15.890> because<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.280> was<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> only<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
40 k because it was the only one on the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.539 
40 k because it was the only one on the
market<00:01:17.360> but<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:17.990> reality<00:01:18.409> he<00:01:18.740> sells<00:01:19.130> work<00:01:19.369> I

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
market but in reality he sells work I

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.960 
market but in reality he sells work I
think<00:01:19.880> 22k<00:01:20.570> in<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.869> end<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.290> still<00:01:21.619> about<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.460> 21

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
think 22k in the end so still about a 21

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
think 22k in the end so still about a 21
k<00:01:23.180> profit<00:01:23.720> just<00:01:23.990> off<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.409> one<00:01:24.619> player<00:01:24.890> which

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
k profit just off that one player which

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.370 
k profit just off that one player which
is<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:25.369> absolutely<00:01:25.790> insane<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.049> only

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
is just absolutely insane the only

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.320 
is just absolutely insane the only
reason<00:01:27.619> I<00:01:27.860> listed<00:01:28.220> him<00:01:28.369> for<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:28.729> much<00:01:28.939> just

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
reason I listed him for that much just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.120 
reason I listed him for that much just
because<00:01:29.780> he<00:01:30.049> was<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.229> only<00:01:30.470> one<00:01:30.619> at<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.920> time

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
because he was the only one at the time

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.940 
because he was the only one at the time
but<00:01:31.760> it<00:01:31.939> was<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:32.330> because<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:32.840> was<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.710> late

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
but it was just because I was on so late

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.070 
but it was just because I was on so late
so<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:34.670> why<00:01:34.790> there<00:01:34.970> was<00:01:35.000> mine<00:01:35.900> was<00:01:36.049> the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
so that's why there was mine was the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.200 
so that's why there was mine was the
only<00:01:36.200> one<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.710> market<00:01:36.880> but<00:01:37.880> then<00:01:38.180> I

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
only one on the market but then I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.210 
only one on the market but then I
decided<00:01:38.659> his<00:01:38.930> lowers<00:01:39.259> price<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.799> he<00:01:39.860> does<00:01:40.009> end

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
decided his lowers price and he does end

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.190 
decided his lowers price and he does end
up<00:01:40.340> selling<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:41.600> someone<00:01:41.869> else<00:01:41.990> put

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
up selling just because someone else put

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.380 
up selling just because someone else put
him<00:01:42.350> up<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:42.470> like<00:01:42.710> 25<00:01:43.490> k<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.000> was<00:01:44.119> like<00:01:44.240> okay

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
have a video I tend to get still been

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.219 
have a video I tend to get still been
asking<00:02:01.430> how<00:02:02.119> do<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.600> method<00:02:03.049> and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
asking how do you do this method and

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.710 
asking how do you do this method and
basically<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.340> have<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:04.939> video<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.299> explains

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
basically I have a video that explains

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.499 
basically I have a video that explains
it<00:02:06.290> all<00:02:06.590> pretty<00:02:06.950> well<00:02:07.189> I<00:02:07.399> would<00:02:07.520> say<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.939> it

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
it all pretty well I would say and it

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.899 
it all pretty well I would say and it
still<00:02:09.170> works<00:02:09.409> like<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.280> fief<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.640> still

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
still works like and the fief is still

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.300 
still works like and the fief is still
working<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.140> definitely<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> method<00:02:13.220> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
working so it's definitely a method to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.830 
working so it's definitely a method to
try<00:02:13.549> out<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:13.999> guys<00:02:14.150> haven't<00:02:14.359> already<00:02:14.540> I'm
