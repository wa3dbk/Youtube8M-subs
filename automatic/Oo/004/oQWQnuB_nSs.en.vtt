that's<00:00:54.239> generally<00:00:54.780> used<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.320> packaging

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that's generally used for packaging

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
that's generally used for packaging
cases<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
cases because this has more give and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
cases because this has more give and
that<00:00:58.770> means<00:00:59.100> less<00:00:59.520> damage<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> case

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that means less damage to the case

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
that means less damage to the case
during<00:01:01.050> shipping<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:02.100> let<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.430> remove<00:01:02.730> the
