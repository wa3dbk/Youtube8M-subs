00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
be 11 smith machine ok let's first talk

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
be 11 smith machine ok let's first talk
about<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.940> bar<00:00:45.149> itself<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.170> all

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
about the bar itself that's where all

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
about the bar itself that's where all
the<00:00:46.260> business<00:00:46.680> takes<00:00:46.920> place<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.300> hooked<00:00:48.570> on

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the business takes place it's hooked on

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
the business takes place it's hooked on
by<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> Jay<00:00:49.620> hooks<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> side<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
by the Jay hooks here on the side and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
by the Jay hooks here on the side and
how<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> works<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> push<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
how that works is when you push up you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.810 
how that works is when you push up you
rotate<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.760> wrists<00:00:54.030> forward<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:56.280> unhook<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
rotate your wrists forward to unhook it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
rotate your wrists forward to unhook it
do<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.510> bench<00:00:57.719> press<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.739> bring<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
do your bench press and then bring it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.869 
do your bench press and then bring it
back<00:00:59.039> bring<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.140> locks<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.710> place

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
back bring it down it locks it in place

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.039 
back bring it down it locks it in place
we're<00:01:02.879> set<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we're set up here with the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.469 
we're set up here with the
counterbalance<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.070> place<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> bar

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
counterbalance in place so the bar

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.590 
counterbalance in place so the bar
itself<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.200> almost<00:01:07.860> free-floating<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.790> far<00:01:09.510> as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
itself is almost free-floating as far as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
itself is almost free-floating as far as
up<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
up and down if you do not have the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
up and down if you do not have the
counterbalance<00:01:11.970> option<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.930> bar<00:01:13.170> itself

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
counterbalance option the bar itself

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
counterbalance option the bar itself
weighs<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.430> 30<00:01:14.790> pounds<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> get-go

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
weighs about 30 pounds from the get-go

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
weighs about 30 pounds from the get-go
so<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.619> bench<00:01:16.799> press<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.189> 30

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so right there your bench press in 30

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.999 
so right there your bench press in 30
pounds<00:01:17.900> attach<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.930> counterbalance<00:01:19.680> system

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pounds attach the counterbalance system

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.670 
pounds attach the counterbalance system
you<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.970> 2<00:01:21.570> pounds<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.020> force<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you got about 2 pounds of force going up

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
you got about 2 pounds of force going up
and<00:01:22.890> maybe<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.880> pounds<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.270> force<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.810> down

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and maybe two pounds of force going down

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
and maybe two pounds of force going down
and<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> counter<00:01:26.250> balances<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and that kind of counter balances the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
and that kind of counter balances the
bar<00:01:27.390> itself<00:01:27.479> why<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.729> let's<00:01:29.729> say

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bar itself why do we do that let's say

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.340 
bar itself why do we do that let's say
you<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.030> someone<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.600> facility<00:01:30.840> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you have someone in your facility that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
you have someone in your facility that
can't<00:01:31.590> even<00:01:31.680> bench<00:01:31.950> press<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.579> bar<00:01:32.729> itself<00:01:32.820> 30

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
can't even bench press the bar itself 30

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
can't even bench press the bar itself 30
pounds<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.409> allows<00:01:34.710> them<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> start<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.579> a

pounds this allows them to start in a
smaller<00:01:36.000> weight<00:01:36.240> maybe<00:01:36.810> five<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.380> each<00:01:37.470> end

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
smaller weight maybe five in each end

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.550 
smaller weight maybe five in each end

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
with the spring steel coil it also goes

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.940 
with the spring steel coil it also goes
up<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:42.980> down<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.760> bar<00:03:44.660> comes<00:03:44.989> down<00:03:45.290> you

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
up and down so as the bar comes down you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.309 
up and down so as the bar comes down you
got<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.130> little<00:03:46.220> bit<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.519> cushion<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.930> guess

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
got a little bit of a cushion to I guess

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.350 
got a little bit of a cushion to I guess
lessen<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.830> blow<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.970> weight<00:03:50.120> coming

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
lessen the blow of the weight coming

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.850 
lessen the blow of the weight coming
down<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.630> way<00:03:50.840> but<00:03:51.440> these<00:03:51.680> will<00:03:51.769> be

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
down this way but these will be

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.440 
down this way but these will be
positioned<00:03:52.340> more<00:03:52.550> down<00:03:52.790> right<00:03:53.120> about<00:03:53.209> your

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
positioned more down right about your

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.509 
positioned more down right about your
chest<00:03:53.780> level<00:03:53.959> as<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.680> bring<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.920> bar<00:03:55.069> down<00:03:55.100> so

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
chest level as you bring the bar down so

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.500 
chest level as you bring the bar down so
if<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.670> brought<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.090> down<00:03:56.799> here<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:59.360> would

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
if I brought this down here it would

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.970

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
your plate for storage so based on how

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.159 
your plate for storage so based on how
much<00:04:31.640> weight<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.210> hold<00:04:32.390> that's<00:04:32.900> really<00:04:33.110> up

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
much weight it can hold that's really up

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.650 
much weight it can hold that's really up
to<00:04:33.289> you<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:34.250> depends<00:04:34.520> on<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.880> size<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.539> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
to you that depends on the size of the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.630 
to you that depends on the size of the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
plates you have of course they take up

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.330 
plates you have of course they take up
the<00:04:37.850> distance<00:04:38.210> as<00:04:38.360> far<00:04:38.539> as<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.039> width
