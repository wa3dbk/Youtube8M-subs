00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.920
 various electronic devices 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.200
 audio is one of the most promising 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.270
 directional line of in-ear headphones 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.699
 Forces the piston already includes several 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.680
 models and the most popular and successful 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.570
 piston 2 and piston 3 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.790
 online shop mystery dots com 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.949
 sent us a couple for a test link in 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.980
 description we listened to them compared 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.090
 and ready to share your impressions 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.400
 headphones come in unpretentious 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.559
 packing box contents wrapped in 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.210
 cardboard petal inscriptions on which rarely 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.809
 will say something if you don't know 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.090
 Chinese 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.460
 inside we find plastic cases 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.500
 in which there is a winding 3 pairs 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.200
 interchangeable ear cushions as well as the second 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.870
 generation of pistons clamp worth noting 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.640
 that in April 2014 xiaomi released 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 on sale updated version of piston 2 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
 the so -called piston 2 1 she got 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.020
 slightly longer cable and modified 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.910
 nozzles for sound identical with us on 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.770
 review an updated version of the old you 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.450
 Now you will not find anywhere but 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.880
 so as not to get confused we will call him 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.649
 just piston 2 if you don't have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 special carrying bags then 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.459
 rubber pads can be used 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.679
 for transporting accessories piston 2 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.420
 completely recessed into the coil about the case of 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.670
 fine silicone nozzles will cling 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.270
 the contents of pockets and bags more active 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.130
 collect 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.349
 and villi if pay attention to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.700
 replaceable ear cushions then you will notice 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.440
 piston 2 is additionally completed 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.390
 sml sizes 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.840
 whereas piston 3 is accompanied 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.700
 nozzles xs s l if you put them next 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.349
 then you can see that piston elf 2 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 more than piston 3 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.550
 nozzles defaults are also slightly higher than the second 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.500
 generation weight difference is 2 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.539
 grams in favor of piston 3 however due to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740
 plastic does not, on the contrary, seem easier than 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.780
 metal piston 2 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.819
 if you just look at the headphones then 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.709
 we can say that the piston 3 with the fold 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.840
 should improve sit in your ears since 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.259
 seems to be more ergonomic but not in my 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.940
 case 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.250
 piston 2 is holding me much 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.509
 more confident and when walking cod head 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.670
 does not fall out at all 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
 piston 3 can't boast the same 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 deep fit because of the shape 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.130
 which means you can forget juicy bass 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.209
 besides not even active movement 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.340
 head and body 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.290
 makes 3 pistons lose fit 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.239
 maybe your case will be different 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.840
 especially if you are not broad hearing 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.060
 channel 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.950
 so I advise you to order both pairs 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.629
 inexpensive to choose more convenient 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.700
 author to give his half with 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.310
 beautiful ears sell colleagues with 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.470
 burdock or leave yourself beloved pro 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 stock long use both 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.580
 generations do not deliver discomfort to 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.010
 in terms of practicality and durability, they 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.230
 plus or minus are equal winding cables look 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.780
 securely and longitudinal notches on the body 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 piston 2 tends to get clogged with mud not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.799
 neglect cleaning the control panel 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 has undergone significant changes in 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.940
 the second caps with the central key for 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.590
 play pauses are on one 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 side and volume buttons 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 on the other they are large recessed into the hull 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.910
 and pressed with more effort than 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.380
 narrow buttons piston 3 towering over 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.540
 corps going in one row 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.459
 u piston 2 to touch almost miss 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.989
 impossible from bullets piston 3 can 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.849
 cause inconvenience to users with 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.980
 thumbs up there for the microphone 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.379
 third generation clearer interlocutor 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.430
 I liked the voice more 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.590
 In general, I do not use earplugs 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.680
 preferring danang 600 for home and 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.150
 creative argo on board us for travel 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.620
 sound evaluation is always very subjective and 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.780
 we case is no exception 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.730
 no measurements and specifications 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.170
 will replace the real listening myself 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.510
 initially relied on charts and tables 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.410
 from reviews and tests mistakenly buying 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.780
 several headphones 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.519
 so I will not ship you the numbers I 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 listened to the composition of different genres in flac 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.010
 but smartphone meizu mx4 pro from computer 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.560
 through DAC amplifier audi inst mx2 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.630
 In short, the sound from the piston 2 as a whole 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.790
 did not like more of the second generation 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.220
 alive and juicy bass unnecessarily 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.260
 push deep into the ears wider 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.540
 panorama balanced middle and 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 comfortable high but they lack 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.980
 transparency while listening to piston 3 me not 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.829
 left feeling that the tracks do not gloss us 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.319
 and in some kind of jammed mp3 160 plays 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.870
 dirty middle is excessively high 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.570
 bright bass is not enough if you press 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.820
 we eat something normal pop lesson 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.250
 electronics definitely sound better on 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.710
 piston 2 whereas piston 3 is suitable for 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.200
 vocals of classical lung music 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.210
 ambient for movies should also be given away 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.270
 piston 2 preference due to more 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.950
 wide stage and bass from china caps 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.370
 forces go less than $ 20 for 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.409
 a piece 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.210
 is a very interesting offer 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.860
 against the background of Russian prices for sony products 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.750
 sennheiser djebel 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.400
 and other brands in this segment 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.150
 impossible requires incredible quality 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.759
 sounding 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.830
 but piston 3 and the more piston 2 is worth 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.569
 each ruble invested in them and even 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.520
 Poland is really great 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.110
 headphones for your price at least you 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.479
 get good workmanship 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.729
 and the sound will be much better than the sets 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.460
 Headphones of your smartphone including 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.020
