frustrated<00:01:20.020> about<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.920> fact<00:01:21.160> that<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.459> will

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
frustrated about the fact that it will

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.430 
frustrated about the fact that it will
not<00:01:21.789> run<00:01:22.319> Netflix

I figured out and so I'm going to
illustrate<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.509> in<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.380> video<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.679> can
