o to use the code graduates have them
sign<00:07:46.540> up<00:07:46.570> and<00:07:46.780> get<00:07:46.900> instant<00:07:47.260> access<00:07:47.350> into<00:07:47.830> the

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 
sign up and get instant access into the

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.950 
sign up and get instant access into the
main<00:07:48.040> straightaway<00:07:48.400> as<00:07:49.120> well<00:07:49.390> so<00:07:49.780> that's

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 
main straightaway as well so that's

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.340 
main straightaway as well so that's
really<00:07:50.110> good<00:07:50.290> stuff<00:07:50.380> to<00:07:50.560> check<00:07:50.740> out<00:07:50.890> well
