00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
I can show what is going to be replacing

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.780 
I can show what is going to be replacing
it<00:00:06.839> at<00:00:07.020> least<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> time<00:00:07.529> being<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.220> here

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it at least for the time being and here

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.670 
it at least for the time being and here
it<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:15.500> good<00:00:16.500> place<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.859> start<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> top

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
it is a good place to start at the top

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
it is a good place to start at the top
much<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> original<00:00:20.460> saw<00:00:21.090> right

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
much of this is the original saw right

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.000 
much of this is the original saw right
here<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:22.039> just<00:00:23.039> cleaned<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.680> fix<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.890> up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
here I just cleaned it up and fix it up

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.330 
here I just cleaned it up and fix it up
to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> point<00:00:26.519> where<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:28.099> nearly<00:00:29.099> new

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to the point where it's very nearly new

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.420 
to the point where it's very nearly new
added<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> outfeed<00:00:30.990> table<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:32.070> 12

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
added this outfeed table it's about 12

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
added this outfeed table it's about 12
inches<00:00:32.669> deep<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:35.180> really<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.300> covers

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
inches deep and really it just covers

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
inches deep and really it just covers
the<00:00:36.989> motor<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.500> even<00:00:37.890> wanted<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> stick<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.820> too

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the motor I even wanted to stick out too

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
the motor I even wanted to stick out too
far<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.379> didn't<00:00:40.710> want<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.100> saw<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
far because I didn't want this saw to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
far because I didn't want this saw to
take<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.969> too<00:00:42.180> much<00:00:42.210> space<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.440> give<00:00:43.559> me<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
take up too much space and it give me a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.069 
take up too much space and it give me a
little<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.370> rip<00:00:44.730> capacity<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> added

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
little bit more rip capacity I added

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.770 
little bit more rip capacity I added
this<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.829> wooden<00:00:47.520> side<00:00:47.789> table<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this other wooden side table on the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.959 
this other wooden side table on the
right<00:00:48.960> side<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> saw<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.610> homemade

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
right side of the saw I use my homemade

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
right side of the saw I use my homemade
fence<00:00:51.329> system<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> other<00:00:52.260> side<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:53.039> as

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
fence system from the other side here as

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
fence system from the other side here as
well<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.090> only<00:00:54.300> change<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> made<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> fence

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
well the only change I made to the fence

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
well the only change I made to the fence
itself<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> had<00:00:56.879> plywood<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> both

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
itself was that I had plywood to both

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
itself was that I had plywood to both
sides<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.280> both<00:00:59.550> sides<00:00:59.850> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sides so I can use it on both sides of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
sides so I can use it on both sides of
the<00:01:00.149> blade<00:01:00.239> saw<00:01:00.960> originally<00:01:01.590> had<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> toggle

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the blade saw originally had a toggle

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
the blade saw originally had a toggle
switch<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.120> further<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
switch and I was further in on the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520 
switch and I was further in on the
cabinet<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> hard-to-reach<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> fix<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
cabinet and hard-to-reach so to fix that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
cabinet and hard-to-reach so to fix that
I<00:01:08.010> added<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.180> twenty<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.979> pole<00:01:11.280> switch<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I added a twenty and two pole switch and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990 
I added a twenty and two pole switch and
mounted<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.229> plywood<00:01:13.590> box<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.430> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
mounted into this plywood box and it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
mounted into this plywood box and it
sticks<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.570> far<00:01:15.930> enough<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> easily

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
sticks out far enough that I can easily

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
sticks out far enough that I can easily
reach<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> original<00:01:21.330> base<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> saw

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
reach it the original base on the saw

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
reach it the original base on the saw
was<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:22.979> unstable<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.060> thought

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
was a little bit unstable and I thought

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
was a little bit unstable and I thought
that<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> time<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that if I'm going to take the time to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.730 
that if I'm going to take the time to
fix<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:28.110> build<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.560> better

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
fix it up I might as well build a better

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.940 
fix it up I might as well build a better
one<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.729> used<00:01:30.270> plywood<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.650> home<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
one so I used plywood from my home a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
one so I used plywood from my home a
table<00:01:32.340> saw<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.820> made<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> new<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.049> i<00:01:34.430> shortened

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
table saw and made a new one i shortened

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030 
table saw and made a new one i shortened
leveling<00:01:35.939> legs<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.540> old<00:01:36.780> saw<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.530> put

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
leveling legs from my old saw and put

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.929 
leveling legs from my old saw and put
them<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.520> one

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
them on this one

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
them on this one
and<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.659> add<00:01:39.810> mass<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.680> stability<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.520> saw

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and to add mass and stability to the saw

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
and to add mass and stability to the saw
I<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> base<00:01:42.899> big<00:01:43.320> enough<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I made the base big enough so that the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
I made the base big enough so that the
concrete<00:01:44.700> side<00:01:45.299> table<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.140> old<00:01:46.320> saw

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
concrete side table from my old saw

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
concrete side table from my old saw
could<00:01:46.890> fit<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:48.180> make<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> possible<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
could fit in here to make it possible to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
could fit in here to make it possible to
move<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.470> Saudis<00:01:50.040> aliy<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.750> removable

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
move the Saudis aliy this is removable

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.069 
move the Saudis aliy this is removable

collection here is with a bin when I
bought<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> side<00:02:00.149> had<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> three-quarter

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
bought the side had a three-quarter

horsepower motor on

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.139 
horsepower motor on
and<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.500> replaced<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.100> motor<00:02:04.399> with<00:02:04.909> this

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
and I replaced that motor with this

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.139 
and I replaced that motor with this
motor<00:02:05.479> from<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> Delta<00:02:06.740> side<00:02:07.159> it's<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.820> woman

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
motor from the Delta side it's a woman

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.509 
motor from the Delta side it's a woman
to<00:02:08.209> have<00:02:08.360> horsepower<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.379> added<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.280> simple

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
to have horsepower I added a simple

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.880 
to have horsepower I added a simple
tensioner<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.540> stop<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.379> motor<00:02:12.590> from

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
tensioner to stop the motor from

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.759 
tensioner to stop the motor from
climbing<00:02:13.459> up<00:02:13.610> when<00:02:13.879> it's<00:02:14.030> under<00:02:14.300> load<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
climbing up when it's under load and I

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.040 
climbing up when it's under load and I
replaced<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.459> rubber<00:02:16.849> belt<00:02:17.209> with<00:02:17.660> one<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
replaced the rubber belt with one of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.410 
replaced the rubber belt with one of
these<00:02:18.170> link<00:02:18.560> bells<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:20.180> cuts

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
these link bells and that really cuts

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.509 
these link bells and that really cuts
down<00:02:20.599> on<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.989> amount<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.319> vibration<00:02:21.890> so

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
down on the amount of vibration so

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.000 
down on the amount of vibration so
that's<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.790> look<00:02:22.910> at<00:02:23.030> my<00:02:23.150> new<00:02:23.269> saw<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that's a look at my new saw as it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000 
that's a look at my new saw as it
happens<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.760> one<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.120> still<00:02:27.010> temporary

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
happens this one is still temporary

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.490 
happens this one is still temporary
until<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.760> get<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> other<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:29.420> built<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
until I get the other one built the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.949 
until I get the other one built the
Delta<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.069> will<00:02:31.190> be<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> bigger<00:02:31.959> more

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
Delta that will be a bigger more

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.949 
Delta that will be a bigger more
elaborate<00:02:33.620> saw<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:35.329> will<00:02:35.450> have<00:02:35.599> a<00:02:35.630> few

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
elaborate saw and it will have a few

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.140 
elaborate saw and it will have a few
more<00:02:36.079> features<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.920> guess<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> only<00:02:38.030> thing

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
more features I guess the only thing

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:55.680 
more features I guess the only thing
left<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.049> make<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> cut

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.400 

now<00:02:56.830> see<00:02:57.830> some<00:02:57.890> work<00:02:58.160> pretty<00:02:58.370> good<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:59.410> did

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
now see some work pretty good I did

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.510 
now see some work pretty good I did
thanks<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.040> watching

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.490 

wait<00:03:04.520> that's<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:04.819> all<00:03:04.940> I've<00:03:05.780> got<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.020> couple<00:03:06.319> of

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
wait that's not all I've got a couple of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.949 
wait that's not all I've got a couple of
tests<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.069> did<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.700> check<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.060> accuracy<00:03:08.599> I

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
tests that I did to check for accuracy I

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.120 
tests that I did to check for accuracy I
put<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> good<00:03:10.130> 10-inch<00:03:10.640> blade<00:03:10.819> in<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.510> saw<00:03:12.130> I'm

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
put a good 10-inch blade in the saw I'm

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.300 
put a good 10-inch blade in the saw I'm
pretty<00:03:13.730> sure<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.120> that's<00:03:14.390> flat<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.190> now<00:03:16.190> I'm

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
pretty sure that that's flat and now I'm

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.880 
pretty sure that that's flat and now I'm
going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.520> check<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.880> run<00:03:17.030> out<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> Arbor

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
going to check the run out on the Arbor

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.390 
going to check the run out on the Arbor
I'm<00:03:19.090> turning<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.269> by<00:03:20.750> pulling<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.040> belt

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I'm turning it by pulling on the belt

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:34.350 
I'm turning it by pulling on the belt
I'm<00:03:22.730> not<00:03:22.910> actually<00:03:23.150> touching<00:03:24.019> your<00:03:24.200> Arbor

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.759 

looks<00:03:35.360> like<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.660> have<00:03:35.870> about<00:03:36.019> three<00:03:36.940> thousands

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
looks like I have about three thousands

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.660 
looks like I have about three thousands
and<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:41.319> can<00:03:42.319> live<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:42.799> for<00:03:43.340> those<00:03:43.459> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
and I can live with that for those that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.740 
and I can live with that for those that
don't<00:03:43.819> really<00:03:44.180> know<00:03:44.360> what<00:03:44.660> 3000<00:03:45.560> says<00:03:46.750> sheet

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
don't really know what 3000 says sheet

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.320 
don't really know what 3000 says sheet
of<00:03:47.870> standard<00:03:48.260> papers<00:03:48.650> about<00:03:49.090> 4000<00:03:50.090> thick

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
of standard papers about 4000 thick

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.690 
of standard papers about 4000 thick
something<00:03:51.230> else<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.530> wanted<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:51.860> look<00:03:52.040> at<00:03:52.310> was

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
something else I wanted to look at was

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.130 
something else I wanted to look at was
as<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.810> blade<00:03:54.080> tilts<00:03:54.830> how<00:03:55.819> far<00:03:56.480> does<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.959> move

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
as the blade tilts how far does it move

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.800 
as the blade tilts how far does it move
off<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:58.160> center<00:03:58.850> axis<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.510> the<00:04:00.280> tabletop<00:04:01.280> and

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
off the center axis of the tabletop and

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.140 
off the center axis of the tabletop and
I<00:04:02.810> was<00:04:02.959> concerned<00:04:03.320> about<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.890> because

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
I was concerned about that because

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.630 
I was concerned about that because
changing<00:04:05.150> out<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.829> Arbor<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.160> bearings

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
changing out the Arbor and the bearings

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.400 
changing out the Arbor and the bearings
could<00:04:08.630> affect<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.680> I'm<00:04:10.100> just<00:04:10.160> going<00:04:10.459> to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
could affect that so I'm just going to

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.890 
could affect that so I'm just going to
change<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.799> from<00:04:12.829> 45<00:04:13.609> now<00:04:13.940> I've<00:04:14.150> got<00:04:14.329> my<00:04:14.510> ruler

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
change it from 45 now I've got my ruler

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.890 
change it from 45 now I've got my ruler
right<00:04:15.230> up<00:04:15.380> against<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.890> tooth<00:04:16.660> I'm<00:04:17.660> going<00:04:17.840> to

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
right up against the tooth I'm going to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:27.550 
right up against the tooth I'm going to
rotate<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:18.950> 90<00:04:19.459> degrees

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:37.900 

I<00:04:32.530> think<00:04:33.530> that's<00:04:33.830> perfectly<00:04:34.900> dead-on
