00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this particular interface you don't have

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.300 
this particular interface you don't have
to<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:44.729> ahead<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.439> once<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.770> said<00:01:46.950> flip

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to go ahead and once like I said flip

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.570 
to go ahead and once like I said flip
open<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
open the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.440 
open the
the<00:01:49.150> cover<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:51.220> then<00:01:51.400> we<00:01:51.520> would<00:01:51.610> go<00:01:51.760> back<00:01:52.030> it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
the cover and then we would go back it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.970 
the cover and then we would go back it
doesn't<00:01:52.840> go<00:01:52.930> back<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.350> camera<00:01:53.590> interface

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
doesn't go back to the camera interface

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.370 
doesn't go back to the camera interface
it<00:01:54.400> goes<00:01:54.550> back<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.180> standard<00:01:55.840> interface

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
it goes back to the standard interface

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.950 
it goes back to the standard interface
and<00:01:56.680> have<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.100> action<00:01:57.460> meme<00:01:57.670> memo<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.450> you're
