 there are links in the description hello 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 Today we are talking about a blue tooth or such 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.710
 bluetooth data transfer method 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.510
 bluetooth bluetooth by the way did you know that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 bluetooth name was given to this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.109
 type in honor of king harold of denmark 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 bluetooth which united 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.620
 Scandinavian land than and went into 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 viking history i.e. analogy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
 understandable king united lands a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.489
 bluetooth invented in 1998 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.100
 bluetooth group with reg 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 combined all file transfer devices 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 or information for a short distance 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 it's not just bluetooth prerogative 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.829
 modern devices can be found 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.260
 such file transfer methods as nfc and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 even the infrared port but uses them wrong 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.789
 often not for such bluetooth volumes 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 the thing is good and I think each of us to them 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.329
 enjoyed so disassemble that of 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.369
 themselves technology represents these they are not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 I will instead be with you now 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.299
 consider how it turns out that our 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100
 files in the air fall from one 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.010
 phone to another at the heart of work 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.490
 bluetooth and radio frequencies lie but not all 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 of them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 but only those who are in a narrow 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 frequency range from 2402 to 2480 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 megahertz this range and also called a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 and sm 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 and it is used in industry 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 medicine and science 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 but let's look inside our 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 device on board with transistors and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 there are small wire tracks 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.509
 nondescript type this is bluetooth 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.939
 often they build Wi-Fi or 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.829
 even f fm receiver to constructively 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.930
 take up less space and in which case 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.360
 one could just replace one chip 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.970
 others from the chip goes to the dam big 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 antenna in the form of a track it radiates 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 radio signal on the required purity 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.329
 however, in modern devices everything 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.640
 more often used with aussi in which already 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.469
 Bluetooth is built in constructively it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.049
 impossible to see since he is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.420
 essentially a part of a crystal that combines 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.160
 imagine a video accelerator and other 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 bluetooth embed items 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.030
 directly into the crystal or endure 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 his individual types decides 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.450
 as a processor manufacturer for example 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.459
 not everyone is up to date 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.800
 from mediatek equipped with bluetooth in 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.410
 crystal why mediatek releases and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 individual bluetooth chips this is mt 66 1266 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.030
 2266 26 which can be freely bought on 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.580
 the same aliexpress and they cost about 10 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 and 15 dollars but let's take a closer look. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.209
 Consider the process of transferring them as 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.980
 we just selected the file to transfer 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.720
 the processor includes bluetooth and it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.459
 starts to monitor all available 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.260
 device in the visible range 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.330
 bluetooth on the other end 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 doing the same thing is worth noting 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.860
 that bluetooth is not only a receiver but 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.540
 and the transmitter however he cannot 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.850
 both receive and transmit 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.750
 files are just files because if 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.790
 talk about using 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.310
 bluetooth headset this sound can go 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.870
 both at the reception and at the transfer but 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.730
 that 's another story 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.800
 so after we mated ours 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 devices in bluetooth us coit 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.970
 magic happens one of bluetooth av 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.310
 becomes the transmitter and the second 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 receiver with bluetooth transmitter 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.660
 forms a pattern of frequency oscillations 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.690
 which changes 1600 times per second 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.880
 taking the value of one of the available 79 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.010
 by frequency this pattern transmitter 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.110
 hands over the receiver so understand friend 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.760
 friends can only those devices that 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.769
 tuned to the same pattern 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.019
 gears for devices 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.470
 transmitted information will be normal 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.910
 noise is the transmission algorithm called 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.590
 pseudo-random immediately before 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.660
 transfer files bluetooth transmitter 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.260
 breaks data into bluetooth packets 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.420
 receiver 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.310
 These packets are then received by the processor. 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.709
 the receiver accepts these packets 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.019
 puts them in one file and puts it 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.120
 in the permanent memory of the device all this 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.709
 it takes about a few seconds 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.820
 Of course, depending on the size 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.370
 file being transferred 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.440
 but so was not always probably many of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.450
 you remember the times when file transfer 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.070
 on the bluetooth was still the maracay 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.500
 and not all devices were compatible 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.450
 among themselves and if the elji were transferred to 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.870
 Nokia for example it is generally in full 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.670
 blockage 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.250
 it was all about bluetooth versions 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.470
 for example bluetooth 1.0 was wild 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.709
 brake and few of us have seen it in 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.019
 live as well as bluetooth 1.1 and 1.2 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.729
 which differed little among themselves 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.239
 and basically fixed bugs friend 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.120
 friend 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.490
 bluetooth 2.0 fixed many bugs 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.740
 and added support and gear for 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.660
 speeding up data transfer and since 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.940
 bluetooth has acquired an adequate appearance 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.650
 universal love and mass worship 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.430
 by far the most relevant 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.440
 is bluetooth 4.1 it is very fast and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.210
 very energy efficient he 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.830
 so energy efficient that it can 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.139
 work for years on a single charge 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.120
 penlight battery with bluetooth 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.520
 with ah ji really tried and over 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.710
 data and work security 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.810
 together with the networks le r in general he 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.789
 so many buns that all is simply unreal 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
 this is listed in one issue so 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.750
 You can read more about all this . 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.699
 the links in the description are all bluetooth and 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.770
 regardless of the version compatible between 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.710
 themselves but if connect for example 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.470
 bluetooth 4 1 with bluetooth 3.0 then work 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.960
 they will be at bluetooth 3.0 speeds then 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.400
 there is a younger one also we often 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.380
 faced with the fact that some 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.870
 gamepads can only work with 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.580
 bluetooth 30 or higher this is due to 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.470
 hardware speed limit 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.810
 receive and transmit old bluetooth av 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.210
 so even with full compatibility 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.710
 made gamepads writes on everyone 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.930
 case on the box such restrictions 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.520
 I also managed to solve the riddle 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.870
 why bluetooth gamepads can 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.000
 work incorrectly with some 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.090
 old processors from mediatek this 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.009
 connected to the processors and gamepads themselves 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.810
 there nothing to blame it's all about 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.610
 bluetooth implementation curve 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.169
 however, it can be cured programmatically. 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.240
 though not without hemorrhoids 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.039
 and finally, I would like to answer 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.990
 a couple of interesting questions from the internet 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.759
 which may occur in a person not 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.280
 dedicated to the subtleties of mobile 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.099
 no technology can not download bluetooth 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.680
 no phone can not replace bluetooth 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.870
 to a newer version bluetooth 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.909
 you can pick up a virus but only if you 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.009
 you yourself are accepting files from unknown 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.020
 sources the virus itself sneak in 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.150
 bluetooth to you can not but even 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.949
 if you took the virus you need it also 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.659
 self-establish yes and not a fact 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.060
 that this virus will work on your 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.250
 device correctly in general do not fool 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.500
 head which one of the above 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.479
 can make a bluetooth conclusion 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.800
 very cool stuff that is convenient and 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.230
 useful to use in everyday 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.760
 of life 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.440
 bluetooth combined not only everything 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.200
 mobile devices our and all 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.910
 personal computers laptops 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.500
 peripherals printers and much more 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.330
 sections of our lives easier and 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.310
 use of gadgets is more convenient 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.530
 prospects for development theoretically 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.020
 unlimited from bluetooth speakers and 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.360
 gamepads to webcams in tablets and 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.160
 medical devices but that's all 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.350
 now you know about bluetooth and more 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.330
 more sure to share this video 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.400
 with friends so they know the whole truth about 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.710
 blue tooth come to comment my 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.930
 video on andy forum dot ru and get 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.490
 for that money of course subscribe 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.450
 on the channel so as not to miss the release of new 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.700
 video 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:08.260
 this is useful and most importantly free for everyone 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.260
 Thank you all for your attention. 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.680
 strange just for the name was 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.630
 bluetooth is chosen because of the land 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.970
 united not only he but also such 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.430
 historical figures as great ashoka 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.080
 Otto von Bismarck day Genghis Khan at the end 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.270
 ends though Genghis Khan probably not 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.730
 fits but it sounds cool
