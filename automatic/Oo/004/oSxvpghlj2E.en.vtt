00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.150
 just announced arjo s7 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 everything better is already available 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.690
 you can use it as normal to not 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.130
 but i get a way how it does 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.290
 can get and I am going to tell you in this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 explain video 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 The first thing to do is your iPhone 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.630
 connect with itunes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.630
 so plugin in your macbook or your computer 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 so for example you the latest version 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 of itunes you have what to do next 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.230
 is to make a backup of all stops 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.140
 you do your iphone states by making up 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.300
 copy yourself and what you then 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 does is make sure everything is on you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
 iPhone is preserved 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 So if something goes wrong you can do everything on 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 putting back what you are going to do is you 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 iphone restore that recovered completely 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 set as new iphone 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 you are going to do this because your arms are 7 on one 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 iPhone must clean out and only then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.379
 can restore your backup 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 so you ensure that you are the newest 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.070
 version of the recipe 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.170
 you make a copy and lesson from Aachen 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 touch iphone then there is nothing on you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 iphone and you have the latest software 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 that you are currently out is a 6 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 point a point three and for the iphone 5 6 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.640
 point a point 4 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 then click on the website in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.369
 description 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.290
 then you have to scroll down 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.380
 and then the download links stand for this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 all your s7 and look closely at a 10 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
 vice that you have so if your iphone 4 that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 of course you should not file for it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.189
 the iphone 4s toneless for the iphone 5 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.689
 that of course also applies to being 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 iPhone 5 then you must of course 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 not to the iphone file via 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.970
 the outcome always goes for meat and not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 in front of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.619
 cdna well i own an iphone 4s so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.619
 I click on download here 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.710
 then you still have to link to a website 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.399
 file on state and from there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399
 you have to download 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 so you click on the check mark here 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.659
 click on download and and some file 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 downloaded when you downloaded the file 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.799
 shit back to itunes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 you have to click there looking for updates 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.729
 you did not just click on you hold the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 option key press mac and the shift 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 key on windows 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.060
 if you do that then the i opens one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.739
 screen I have put myself in a folder 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 you click it already you click open 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.880
 well then timewise on your iphone 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.500
 the set if installed you can do it 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 just put back from a backup 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 so then you have all your files again 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.950
 then you have poor cvdk 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.749
 if all goes well you already have wax 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.459
 just a bit better and you have all the cool features 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.480
 that others also all you were here 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.219
 to date 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.959
 The can be hard for new version 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.120
 this version also shows some drugs 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.230
 but now you mainly have a different way 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.010
 you would have to wait until the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.150
 autumn 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.950
