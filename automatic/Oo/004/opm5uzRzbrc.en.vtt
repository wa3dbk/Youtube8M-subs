00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.050
 hello friends chefs and cooks today is 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.199
 the eve of my birthday and what better 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.840
 way of celebrating it but preparing a 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.240
 exquisite sweet for tomorrow before 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 we all have to do what is the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.750
 pasta frola which is the base mass for 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.830
 make a lot of Italian sweets for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.830
 example the coast or 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.590
 these ingredients for pasta frola 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 are 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 flour 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 to sugar 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.640
 Butter 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.020
 eggs 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.570
 we will be leavening tonight but 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.850
 it is not necessary to make it more terror 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.650
 the in any case in any case 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 we will also throw lemon peel 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.700
 grated 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 and that these are the ingredients 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.620
 make the pasta frola the first thing that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 we have to do to prepare our 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.920
 frola paste is crushed together 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 butter and sugar 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 so let's throw the butter in 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 one container 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.650
 with sugar 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.409
 two 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.359
 do not 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.719
 and we are going to crush it with our 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.719
 departure 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.069
 ah ah 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.409
 well we have obtained a uniform mass of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.440
 butter and sugar and we're not going to 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.250
 add the other ingredients before 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.640
 we all add the shell of our 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.640
 lemon 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.710
 and then we will add the games 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 of our three new a new what 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.730
 we throw whole and the others we lie down 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.390
 just the gent so let's separate 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.560
 before all the yolk of the clear 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.489
 ah 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.489
 ah 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.960
 now we mix everything and then we add the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 flour 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.500
 here 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 to 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.980
 before measuring the flour we mix 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 our little bags of yeast 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.860
 in such a way to be able to report everything 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.090
 to talk about this classic pasta 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.640
 red does not need yeast but in this 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.950
 case we need to use it because the pie 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.439
 it requires it now little by little we go 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.110
 visiting our flour 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.120
 next to the yeast with everything else 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.519
 the eggs the butter the sugar and the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.650
 last until we have a mass 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.010
 uniform let's add the little flour 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.010
 to little 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.560
 At first we can mix with 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.120
 a spoon a fork but after 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.120
 we will have to resort to hands 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.599
 yes 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.040
 now we start working the dough with 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.310
 the hands for that suits us before 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 state 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.260
 make them flour hands so no 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.370
 the dough hits us a lot and we start 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.650
 mix the flour 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.650
 and also with his hands 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.130
 when the mass does not stick to the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.030
 hands means that double pasta is 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.030
 practically done 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.270
 if you see that he is still sticking 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.270
 you are adding a little flour 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.840
 you see how the dough is watered a lot 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.840
 less to the hands 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.660
 although when our future is 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.970
 practically uniform it no longer sticks 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.970
 hands we have the platform made 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.260
 as you see the mass of that era 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:27.760
 of this kind so it does not stick 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.040
 but it is very malleable and very uniform 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.710
 so nothing here we have our pasta 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.390
 Rola made and this will help us 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.390
 many types of sweets
