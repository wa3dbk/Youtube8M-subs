I<00:00:11.450> had<00:00:12.450> an<00:00:12.660> email<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.139> other<00:00:13.170> day<00:00:13.320> guys<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I had an email the other day guys in

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.810 
I had an email the other day guys in
high<00:00:15.330> school<00:00:15.630> taking<00:00:15.870> wealthy<00:00:16.410> class<00:00:16.700> and<00:00:17.700> he

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
high school taking wealthy class and he

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
high school taking wealthy class and he
said<00:00:18.029> man<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.290> play<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
said man just got to play with the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.130 
said man just got to play with the
plasma<00:00:19.950> cutter<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.700> it<00:00:20.849> is<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.300> cool

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
plasma cutter and it is so cool

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.139 
plasma cutter and it is so cool
but<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.739> instructor<00:00:23.279> said<00:00:23.550> something<00:00:23.970> about

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
but the instructor said something about

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.569 
but the instructor said something about
a<00:00:24.239> new<00:00:24.540> beware<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> heck<00:00:26.610> is<00:00:26.790> nibbler<00:00:27.419> and

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
a new beware the heck is nibbler and

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.060 
a new beware the heck is nibbler and
could<00:00:29.579> I<00:00:29.669> compare<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> two<00:00:30.509> of<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:31.070> that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
could I compare the two of them that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.810 
could I compare the two of them that
sounds<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.489> fun

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
sounds like fun

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.630 
sounds like fun
I<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:37.850> you're<00:00:38.850> fine<00:00:39.089> enough<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.609> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I know you're fine enough so this is a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.349 
I know you're fine enough so this is a
plasma<00:00:42.239> torch<00:00:42.449> plasma<00:00:43.140> cutter<00:00:43.379> torch<00:00:43.999> it<00:00:44.999> runs

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
plasma torch plasma cutter torch it runs

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.540 
plasma torch plasma cutter torch it runs
on<00:00:45.660> electricity<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> compressed<00:00:48.480> air<00:00:49.550> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
on electricity and compressed air and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
on electricity and compressed air and
when<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> air<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.600> through<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.929> gun

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
when the air comes up through the gun

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
when the air comes up through the gun
there's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.399> chamber<00:00:54.149> inside<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.929> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
there's a little chamber inside here it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
there's a little chamber inside here it
makes<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> air<00:00:56.039> swirl<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.409> inside<00:00:58.769> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
makes the air swirl and then inside this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
makes the air swirl and then inside this
little<00:00:59.190> tip<00:00:59.550> there's<00:00:59.999> a<00:01:00.089> nozzle<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
little tip there's a nozzle that this is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
little tip there's a nozzle that this is
the<00:01:01.649> nozzle<00:01:02.069> and<00:01:02.519> there's<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.819> tip<00:01:03.059> inside

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the nozzle and there's a tip inside

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
the nozzle and there's a tip inside
there<00:01:03.749> and<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.559> electrical<00:01:05.070> arc

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
there and you get an electrical arc

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.219 
there and you get an electrical arc
going<00:01:05.700> across<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.870> that's<00:01:07.080> what

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
going across that and that's what

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
going across that and that's what
creates<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> plasma<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.910> get<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
creates the plasma and then you get the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
creates the plasma and then you get the
flame<00:01:09.420> coming<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:11.240> great<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.740> thicker

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
flame coming out great for thicker

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
flame coming out great for thicker
metals<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.940> one<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.300> cut<00:01:15.510> up<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.870> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
metals this one will cut up to a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
metals this one will cut up to a
quarter-inch<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.570> fast<00:01:18.870> but<00:01:19.800> it's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
quarter-inch it's very fast but it's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.340 
quarter-inch it's very fast but it's
kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.190> messy<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.750> enough<00:01:22.050> I<00:01:22.170> can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
kind of messy not like enough I can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.110 
kind of messy not like enough I can
actually<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> settle<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.310> torch<00:01:23.580> messy

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
actually do to settle and torch messy

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.020 
actually do to settle and torch messy
but<00:01:24.480> you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.530> look<00:01:25.950> over<00:01:26.160> here<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> just

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
but you'll see look over here so I just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.930 
but you'll see look over here so I just
grew<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.510> little<00:01:30.780> pattern<00:01:31.230> here<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
grew out a little pattern here and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.770 
grew out a little pattern here and
plasma<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.300> side

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
plasma on one side

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:51.150 
plasma on one side
nibbler<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> other<00:01:34.590> box

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.910 

real<00:01:52.160> quick

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.160 

right

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260 

this<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.890> what<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.220> get<00:02:00.400> when<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.760> cut<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.090> all

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
this is what you get when you cut it all

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.560 
this is what you get when you cut it all
off

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
off

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.530 
off
here<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> Daggett<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:06.060> denying<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.180> have<00:02:07.390> to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
here the Daggett is denying it have to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.340 
here the Daggett is denying it have to
come<00:02:07.720> back<00:02:07.930> in<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.530> drive<00:02:09.009> all<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.340> smooth

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
come back in and drive all that smooth

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.320 
come back in and drive all that smooth
let's<00:02:11.350> grind<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> backside<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.580> get<00:02:13.060> the

let's grind on the backside to get the
get<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.050> slag<00:02:14.380> off<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> little

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
get the slag off and you get a little

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.870 
get the slag off and you get a little
distortion<00:02:17.350> from<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> heat<00:02:18.220> especially<00:02:18.490> on

they<00:02:49.330> don't<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.630> take<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> little<00:02:50.019> chunk<00:02:50.290> out

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
they don't just take a little chunk out

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.449 
they don't just take a little chunk out
as<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.860> go<00:02:50.980> swipe<00:02:51.489> nibbles<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:54.130> really

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
as you go swipe nibbles really really

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.699 
as you go swipe nibbles really really
messy<00:02:55.030> there's<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.690> lot<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.080> little<00:02:56.350> sharp

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
messy there's a lot of little sharp

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.800 
messy there's a lot of little sharp
pieces<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.519> fall<00:02:57.790> out<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.239> bottom<00:02:58.660> as

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
pieces that fall out of the bottom as

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.800 
pieces that fall out of the bottom as
you're<00:02:58.959> working<00:02:59.140> lawn<00:02:59.560> here<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.660> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you're working lawn here and you have to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.960 
you're working lawn here and you have to
keep<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.200> lubricated<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.579> like<00:03:03.790> some

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
keep this lubricated so if you like some

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.539 
keep this lubricated so if you like some
wd-40<00:03:04.780> or<00:03:05.110> cutting<00:03:05.470> fluid<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.190> something<00:03:06.459> like

wd-40 or cutting fluid or something like

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.449 
wd-40 or cutting fluid or something like
that<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:07.299> not<00:03:07.420> only<00:03:07.600> keep<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.980> die<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that to not only keep the die and the

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.170 
that to not only keep the die and the
punch<00:03:09.549> cool<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.370> make<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.549> cut<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.850> little

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
punch cool but to make a cut a little

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.199 
punch cool but to make a cut a little
easier<00:03:13.510> where<00:03:14.110> with<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> plasma<00:03:14.500> cutter<00:03:15.209> just

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
easier where with the plasma cutter just

00:03:16.209 --> 00:04:14.940 
easier where with the plasma cutter just
go<00:03:16.510> for<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.870> yeah<00:03:17.860> what's<00:03:18.280> it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.259 

see<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> lot<00:04:16.160> faster<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:18.440> think<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.549> lot<00:04:19.760> faster

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
see a lot faster I I think a lot faster

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.629 
see a lot faster I I think a lot faster
than<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.540> plasma<00:04:20.989> cutter<00:04:21.170> as<00:04:22.040> far<00:04:22.250> as<00:04:22.400> getting

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
than the plasma cutter as far as getting

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.640 
than the plasma cutter as far as getting
in<00:04:22.880> there<00:04:23.030> where<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.240> want<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.630> go<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:24.530> a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
in there where you want to go it's a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.740 
in there where you want to go it's a
little<00:04:24.919> more<00:04:25.160> controllable<00:04:25.910> I<00:04:26.150> think<00:04:26.419> because

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
little more controllable I think because

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.740 
little more controllable I think because
you<00:04:27.500> can<00:04:27.740> stop<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.310> work<00:04:28.550> along<00:04:29.000> real<00:04:29.300> slow

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
you can stop and work along real slow

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.540 
you can stop and work along real slow
and<00:04:29.780> easy<00:04:30.260> right<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.770> there<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.220> just

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
and easy right in there and just just

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:51.520 
and easy right in there and just just
shave<00:04:32.419> that<00:04:32.900> portion<00:04:33.380> away<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:34.070> like<00:04:34.220> this

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.950 

it's<00:04:52.530> not<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:52.919> a<00:04:52.949> pair<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.250> shears<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.930> a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
it's not like a pair of shears like a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.260 
it's not like a pair of shears like a
pair<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.199> scissors<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.889> can't<00:04:56.610> sit<00:04:56.849> here<00:04:56.880> and

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
pair of scissors you can't sit here and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.960 
pair of scissors you can't sit here and
just<00:04:57.569> follow<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.199> line<00:04:58.470> off<00:04:58.860> you'll<00:04:59.550> put<00:04:59.759> the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
just follow a line off you'll put the

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.379 
just follow a line off you'll put the
dye<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:00.870> bind<00:05:01.259> and<00:05:02.220> snap<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.880> off<00:05:03.000> right<00:05:03.270> at

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
dye and bind and snap it off right at

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.360 
dye and bind and snap it off right at
the<00:05:03.419> base<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:04.169> just<00:05:04.470> for<00:05:04.680> coming<00:05:04.949> in<00:05:05.130> from

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
the base it's just for coming in from

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.610 
the base it's just for coming in from
the<00:05:05.490> open<00:05:05.610> edge<00:05:05.970> you're<00:05:06.840> just<00:05:07.020> taking<00:05:07.440> your

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
the open edge you're just taking your

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.850 
the open edge you're just taking your
little<00:05:07.889> bits<00:05:08.069> of<00:05:08.130> material<00:05:09.500> it's<00:05:10.500> kind<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.740> fun

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
little bits of material it's kind of fun

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.409 
little bits of material it's kind of fun
to<00:05:10.889> play<00:05:11.099> with<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:11.910> great<00:05:12.030> for<00:05:12.210> loyal

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
to play with it it's great for loyal

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:34.390 
to play with it it's great for loyal
sharp<00:05:12.720> corners<00:05:13.229> you<00:05:14.220> can<00:05:14.490> could<00:05:14.669> be

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.160 

they<00:05:35.400> all<00:05:35.550> have<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:35.760> purpose<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.330> guess<00:05:36.510> the

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
they all have a purpose I guess the

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.810 
they all have a purpose I guess the
plasma<00:05:37.560> cutter<00:05:37.680> emerged<00:05:38.100> for<00:05:38.250> thicker<00:05:38.460> metal

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
plasma cutter emerged for thicker metal

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.250 
plasma cutter emerged for thicker metal
and<00:05:39.560> nibbler<00:05:40.560> for<00:05:40.920> thin<00:05:41.160> metal<00:05:41.810> when<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:42.840> tried

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
and nibbler for thin metal when I tried

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.250 
and nibbler for thin metal when I tried
this<00:05:43.500> on<00:05:43.740> stainless<00:05:44.370> steel<00:05:44.850> who<00:05:45.660> a<00:05:45.870> boy<00:05:46.110> that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
this on stainless steel who a boy that

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.800 
this on stainless steel who a boy that
was<00:05:46.320> bad<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.860> broke<00:05:47.220> these<00:05:47.370> off<00:05:47.640> just<00:05:48.120> left<00:05:48.570> and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
was bad I broke these off just left and

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.300 
was bad I broke these off just left and
right<00:05:48.990> there<00:05:49.440> was<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.620> little<00:05:49.950> too<00:05:50.100> heavy

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
right there was a little too heavy

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.030 
right there was a little too heavy
little<00:05:51.030> too<00:05:51.270> hard<00:05:51.630> for<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> nibbler<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.860> run

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
little too hard for the nibbler to run

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.420 
little too hard for the nibbler to run
through<00:05:54.110> that's<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.260> difference<00:05:55.590> can<00:05:56.280> you

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
through that's the difference can you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.190 
through that's the difference can you
hold<00:05:56.640> up<00:05:56.790> your<00:05:57.000> finished<00:05:57.360> product<00:05:57.780> there<00:05:57.990> so

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
hold up your finished product there so

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.840 
hold up your finished product there so
we<00:05:58.320> can<00:05:58.530> solve<00:05:59.390> God<00:06:00.390> it's<00:06:00.630> not<00:06:00.780> in<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:01.140> book

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340 

this<00:06:05.850> he<00:06:06.000> said<00:06:06.240> here's<00:06:06.690> where<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:06.960> plasma

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
this he said here's where the plasma

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.740 
this he said here's where the plasma
cutter<00:06:07.500> cut<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:08.670> you<00:06:08.790> can<00:06:08.940> see<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:09.300> heat

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
cutter cut and you can see the heat

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.510 
cutter cut and you can see the heat
distortion<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:10.890> can<00:06:11.010> see<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.280> burning

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
distortion you can see the burning

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.550 
distortion you can see the burning
that's<00:06:11.940> on<00:06:12.090> there<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:13.050> here's<00:06:13.320> where<00:06:13.530> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
that's on there and here's where the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.820 
that's on there and here's where the
nibbler<00:06:14.070> cut<00:06:14.340> no<00:06:15.000> difference<00:06:15.540> in<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.830> color

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
nibbler cut no difference in the color

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.210 
nibbler cut no difference in the color
of<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.130> steel<00:06:17.460> ball<00:06:18.380> now<00:06:19.380> you<00:06:19.440> turn<00:06:19.950> it<00:06:20.070> over

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
of the steel ball now you turn it over

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.000 
of the steel ball now you turn it over
and<00:06:20.400> you<00:06:20.550> look<00:06:20.700> at<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.880> backside<00:06:21.680> see<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.860> is

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
and you look at the backside see this is

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.600 
and grind this off again smooth this
down<00:06:29.760> to<00:06:30.180> get<00:06:30.330> rid<00:06:30.510> of<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.690> slag<00:06:30.980> and<00:06:31.980> I'd<00:06:32.460> have

down to get rid of the slag and I'd have
