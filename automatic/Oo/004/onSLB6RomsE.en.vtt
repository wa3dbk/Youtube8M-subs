00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:14.399
 I guess I can not use fakes like Titans after all. 

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.185
 I'll remember it! 

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:34.628
 Next time, I'll beat him this Hades! 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.478
 That's it! We must celebrate this victory! 

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:42.276
 There is really no need. 

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.228
 Hm ... 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.881
 Hey, why not an appointment? 

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:48.962
 Huh ?! 

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:56.009
 I must continue my journey and, besides, I am still a trainee ... 

00:00:56.076 --> 00:01:00.115
 I guess you're right, I'm an apprentice warrior myself. 

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:00.762
 Huh? 

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:02.783
 Well, what do you say about that ... 

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.444
 We will make an appointment when I became a warrior! 

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.619
 J-I can not make such a promise! 

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.905
 Awesome! Now it's decided, I must take my training seriously! 

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:26.787
 Aw ... It's already over? And I just finished my training. 

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:31.097
 Aqua? What is going on? You are all red 

00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:33.852
 C-it's nothing ... 

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.947
 You're also trying to become a hero, are not you? 

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.105
 It's not enough to be strong to be a hero, you know? 

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.203
 I know. 

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:46.314
 I may not become a hero if I only focus on my strength. 

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:49.974
 I realized that, after seeing you, you and Zack. 

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:53.573
 It seems like your heart is on the right track. 

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.751
 I know you'll become a hero someday! 

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:03.067
 Terra, I know that one day you too. 

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.937
 You can use the D-link with Zack. 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.980
 Mark of Hero A Keyblade with a powerful attacking power. High critical hit rate. 

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.582
 That's it! 

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.195
 I will be the leader! 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.639
 Aw, I was so close! 

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.551
 It was for lost boys! 

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:41.984
 To fart! 

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:48.026
 But the rules are the rules, if you found the map first 

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.769
 you will be the leader. 

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:51.968
 Leader? 

00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:53.562
 From our expedition! 

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:58.867
 We go on the treasure hunt! And it's the treasure map. 

00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:04.463
 Girls can not join you say? 

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:07.668
 Why not? More the merrier, the merrier! 

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:13.203
 I have more important things to do, so I go back. 

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:17.746
 It's not great ... but the rules are absolute. 

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:22.209
 This means that all we can do is forget our treasure hunt. 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.080
 I guess we can not do anything about it. I'll join you for a while. 

00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:33.674
 Yay! 

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.431
 That's where we are. 

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:45.691
 And the place where there is an X is where there is the treasure. 

00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:48.302
 It does not matter! Let's go there! 

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:51.484
 Oh yes! I did not even ask for our chef's name! 

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:56.365
 I'm Peter Pan, and the jealous little girl is bell! 

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:58.018
 And you are? 

00:03:58.144 --> 00:03:59.463
 I am Aqua. 

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.531
 So YOU â€‹â€‹ARE Aqua! 

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:05.276
 Well, first we go to Mermaid Lagoon! 

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.116
 Okay. 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.471
 I found you, Peter Pan! 

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:41.476
 Today is surely the day you will live your end! 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:47.319
 I'm in a hurry today Captain, we'll fight again. 

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:51.826
 I do not fight at your convenience! Give me back my treasure! 

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:53.488
 Who is it? 

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:57.963
 Oh, it's only Crochet, this stingy pirate. Do not pay attention to him. 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.770
 Why do you - how dare you make fun of me! 

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:03.553
 Fly! 

00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.204
 This is the captain's signal! 

00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:10.611
 Fire! 

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:20.733
 We'll get a shot if we stay here, RUN! 

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:26.747
 What is it? 

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:29.774
 The X on the map marks the place, up there ... 

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:37.406
 Do not worry! With a little fairy dust and we can easily fly up. 

00:05:37.488 --> 00:05:42.248
 But, I have never flown so high .. 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.869
 And if we fell? 

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:47.026
 Since when are you shy cats? 

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:50.316
 it's not a little hard for them? 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.278
 You stay outside of that, Aqua. 

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.826
 If you want to find the treasure, you must be brave! 

00:05:55.882 --> 00:05:58.802
 Y-yes ... 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.180
 Do your thing, bell! 

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:03.125
 Hurry up and we'll go! 

00:06:08.124 --> 00:06:09.764
 Follow Clochette! 

00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:32.165
 Is not that where we should be? 

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:35.185
 We did the whole island for nothing! 

00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:39.271
 It was not for nothing. 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.290
 If we had found the treasure as easily, it would not have been funny ... 

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.942
 I guess I've underestimated you a bit. 

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:50.362
 You led the boys for their good, did not you? 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.668
 Oh it's nothing ... 

00:06:53.255 --> 00:06:56.335
 You're coming too late, Peter Pan! 

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:59.495
 I already have my treasure. 

00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:02.081
 Hook! 

00:07:02.127 --> 00:07:05.207
 Open the chest, Fly! 

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.048
 Aye aye, Cap'in '! 

00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:11.632
 What is Monsieur Mouche? 

00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:15.792
 Captain ... the treasure .... 

00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:18.123
 What the treasure ???! 

00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:23.209
 What is this trash ?! 

00:07:23.247 --> 00:07:27.848
 It's our treasure! 

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:30.705
 Where is the treasure that was there first ?! 

00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:33.585
 Everything has disappeared. 

00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:35.757
 Faded away?! 

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:39.365
 You will not get away with it this time, get ready! 

00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:45.141
 Hm? What is it? This .. ticking. 

00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:50.863
 He is back! 

00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:53.962
 Move back! Stay here! 

00:07:56.605 --> 00:07:58.965
 Captain!
