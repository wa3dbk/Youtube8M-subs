00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
ten I'm giving this I'm giving this a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.940 
ten I'm giving this I'm giving this a
seven<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.880> could<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.120> better<00:03:36.950> you

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
seven you know it could be better you

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.530 
seven you know it could be better you
know<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.099> could<00:03:38.250> have<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.579> know<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.940> thought

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
know they could have you know I thought

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.440 
know they could have you know I thought
it<00:03:39.630> would<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:39.959> more<00:03:40.169> tastier<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.639> so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
it would be a little more tastier so so

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.289 
it would be a little more tastier so so
but<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.630> was<00:03:42.750> able<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.079> use<00:03:43.260> will<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.650> lose<00:03:43.829> fat

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
but I was able to use will you lose fat

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.809 
but I was able to use will you lose fat
cuz<00:03:45.299> fat<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.720> flavor<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.370> want<00:03:47.489> flavor

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
cuz fat is flavor and you want flavor

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.809 
cuz fat is flavor and you want flavor
add<00:03:48.150> fat<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:48.989> butter<00:03:49.829> that's<00:03:50.130> why<00:03:50.280> yeah

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
add fat you want butter that's why yeah

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.009 
add fat you want butter that's why yeah
when<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.060> add<00:03:51.209> butter<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.510> everything<00:03:51.810> cuz

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
when you add butter to everything cuz

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.240 
when you add butter to everything cuz
it's<00:03:52.139> fat<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.620> makes<00:03:52.950> everything<00:03:53.160> taste

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's fat it makes everything taste

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's fat it makes everything taste
better<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:54.359> that's<00:03:54.989> why<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.280> less<00:03:56.459> fat

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
better so that's why so it's less fat

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.949 
better so that's why so it's less fat
less<00:03:57.090> flavor<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.609> makes<00:03:59.790> sense<00:04:00.030> but

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
less flavor and so that makes sense but

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.349 
less flavor and so that makes sense but
your<00:04:01.169> that's<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.280> payoff<00:04:02.459> you're<00:04:02.910> eating<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
your that's the payoff you're eating a

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.210 
your that's the payoff you're eating a
little<00:04:03.569> healthier<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:03.989> that's<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.319> yang<00:04:04.560> so

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
little healthier so that's it yang so

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.350 
little healthier so that's it yang so
