is<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.539> peaceful<00:00:46.840> good

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860

I'm<00:00:49.340> not<00:00:49.730> sure<00:00:49.970> which<00:00:50.330> one<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.540> would<00:00:50.780> be

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
I'm not sure which one that would be

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.890 
I'm not sure which one that would be
because<00:00:52.130> there<00:00:52.460> are<00:00:52.640> quite<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.030> few

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.010 

so<00:01:01.380> that<00:01:01.590> quite<00:01:01.830> possibly<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.730> red

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.889 

I<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:09.159> for<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> fact<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.630> previous

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
I know for a fact that the previous

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.310 
I know for a fact that the previous
owner<00:01:12.840> thought<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.439> problem<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:17.049> this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
owner thought that the problem with this

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.139 
owner thought that the problem with this
being<00:01:17.830> pushed<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.970> like<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.630> was<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.350> switch

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
being pushed in like that was the switch

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.330 
being pushed in like that was the switch
so<00:01:22.149> he<00:01:22.330> bought<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.570> new<00:01:22.899> switch<00:01:23.350> from<00:01:23.619> Panasonic

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
so he bought a new switch from Panasonic

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.950 
so he bought a new switch from Panasonic
arts<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.860> don't<00:01:27.700> know<00:01:28.030> if<00:01:28.179> maybe<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
arts and I don't know if maybe the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.880 
arts and I don't know if maybe the
switches<00:01:29.439> bad<00:01:30.330> but<00:01:31.330> as<00:01:31.539> you<00:01:31.750> clearly<00:01:32.049> saw<00:01:32.560> I
