00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 if you are flying with the voices that have been heard of how it can be a 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.460
 forward a valencia player knowing that next year is going to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.059
 chop 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.609
 cesena bothered because 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.969
 the above all because of how I am not equal to another player another person does not care 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.949
 no but throughout my life 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.550
 I have worked with a lot of honor with a lot of noise with a lot of humility and and to be said 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.039
 that I play not just a season like somebody could have said yes no 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.829
 one match 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.599
 without having one hundred percent 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.839
 more the expectations put in team that valence because it hurts very much 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.950
 but good 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.610
 tell people that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.130
 according to that he respects the opinions but that is an absolute barbarity is a 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.740
 person like me 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.910
 it can not happen and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.940
 i has spent the base has signed a villa 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870
 he has a staff that he already knows what he was thinking about 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.810
 your game is good for barsa too 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.830
 and the Madrid tab to mouriÃ±o I think will bring crazy to all 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 manolo abel or lower rank saying no beyond 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.760
 I have to say that he wants mourinho I think because of his statistics and on the other hand 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.940
 obsess 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.480
 a great trainer has shown this with massera not being able to sign not very 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.040
 happy to have signed for him the barista condendo of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.960
 but he has raised to enter that I have and in this case otherwise I can not 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.110
 say more than this one 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 or some journalists criticize the bbva league 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.440
 e that is a Scottish league forest madrid and Barcelona here we give ourselves 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.600
 how we have come to the end of this season in the bbva league 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.230
 This is the best league in the world 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.670
 I believe that yes no I believe that yes indeed you can year after year you will see 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 as there are very few players in our league who showed up in other leagues 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.470
 in his car the last few years more and as there are other players for with the 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.380
 best players in this case from other leagues come to ours by 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.970
 so that makes 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.810
 that the league is better than it has not been competitive except in this case for the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.830
 league by madrid barsa 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.800
 but it's because the madrid is based spectacular state not in any other league 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 they would have made that same score 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.760
 and in fact they have broken records both mother and basso therefore not 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.920
 you can not talk about what is worse than another because it's less 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.330
 competitive company are less competitive both
