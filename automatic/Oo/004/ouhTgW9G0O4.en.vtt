00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.580 
is fantastic news and at first I was
kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> knew<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.500> going

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
kind of a bit like I knew it was going

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
kind of a bit like I knew it was going
to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> announced<00:00:46.950> Forza<00:00:47.670> horizon<00:00:47.760> 2<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to be announced Forza horizon 2 but I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
to be announced Forza horizon 2 but I
was<00:00:48.750> always<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.160> didn't<00:00:50.370> know

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
was always on it because I didn't know

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
was always on it because I didn't know
if<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.329> announced<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.989> only

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
if it was going to be announced for only

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
if it was going to be announced for only
Xbox<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> guess<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> thought

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
Xbox one I guess that's what I thought

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
Xbox one I guess that's what I thought
it<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.960> released<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.440> only<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it was going to be released for only but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
it was going to be released for only but
it's<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.210> 360<00:00:57.780> also<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it's not it's going to be on 360 also so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
it's not it's going to be on 360 also so
that<00:00:58.230> means<00:00:58.500> i<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.800> fall<00:00:59.219> back<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that means i can actually fall back if I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
that means i can actually fall back if I
can't<00:00:59.969> afford<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.449> Xbox<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> time<00:01:01.199> and

obviously it's gonna be set in a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
obviously it's gonna be set in a
location<00:01:46.020> where<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.040> location<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.640> not

Louisiana<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> lot<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.110> rumors<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.560> been

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
Louisiana like a lot of rumors have been

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980 
Louisiana like a lot of rumors have been
suggesting<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.700> actually<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
suggesting is actually going to be in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
suggesting is actually going to be in
South<00:01:52.409> Europe<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> weird<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
South Europe which is kind of weird in a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
South Europe which is kind of weird in a
good<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.890> hasn't<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.490> i've

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
good way because it hasn't really i've

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149 
good way because it hasn't really i've
already<00:01:57.030> seen<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> before<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.350> i<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.920> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
already seen that before so i think is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
already seen that before so i think is
good<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.790> they're<00:02:00.060> doing<00:02:00.240> somewhere

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
good that they're doing somewhere

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030 
good that they're doing somewhere
different<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.170> usually<00:02:01.380> games<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.009> just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
different because usually games are just

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.420 
different because usually games are just
america<00:02:02.729> america<00:02:03.240> america<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.130> no<00:02:05.130> else

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
america america america and no else

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.940 
america america america and no else
really<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.420> having<00:02:07.020> somewhere<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.439> europe<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
really so having somewhere in europe is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.940 
really so having somewhere in europe is
great<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.849> different<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.450> cool<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
great it's it's different it's cool and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
because 4 sir 5 had less cars that I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.940 
because 4 sir 5 had less cars that I
believe<00:02:23.090> than<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.780> Forza<00:02:24.140> 4<00:02:24.349> game<00:02:24.590> before<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
believe than the Forza 4 game before the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.789 
believe than the Forza 4 game before the
three<00:02:25.159> games<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.599> but<00:02:26.599> hopefully<00:02:27.409> this<00:02:27.590> time

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
three games and but hopefully this time

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.990 
three games and but hopefully this time
they've<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.069> managed<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.579> finally<00:02:28.790> get

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
they've actually managed to finally get

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300 
they've actually managed to finally get
all<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> cars<00:02:29.599> in<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:30.200> forza<00:02:30.650> horizon<00:02:30.769> and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
all the cars in for forza horizon and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.130 
all the cars in for forza horizon and
that<00:02:32.120> would<00:02:32.359> be<00:02:32.480> awesome<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:32.959> did<00:02:33.109> that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that would be awesome if they did that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.080 
that would be awesome if they did that
because<00:02:33.409> more<00:02:34.159> cars<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.670> better<00:02:34.790> it's<00:02:35.060> a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
because more cars the better it's a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.610 
because more cars the better it's a
racing<00:02:35.299> game<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:35.959> girls<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.379> better

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
footage on the IGM blog I've rushed

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.449 
footage on the IGM blog I've rushed
through<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.680> at<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.739> supposed<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.099> be<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.190> kind

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
through it at the supposed to be a kind

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.520 
through it at the supposed to be a kind
of<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.670> video<00:02:55.879> preview<00:02:56.659> so<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.139> can<00:02:57.409> actually

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
of a video preview so you can actually

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.649 
of a video preview so you can actually
have<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.129> look<00:02:58.549> at<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:59.120> they're<00:02:59.269> doing<00:02:59.569> with

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
have a look at what they're doing with

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.449 
have a look at what they're doing with
the<00:02:59.810> game<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.200> see<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.310> so
