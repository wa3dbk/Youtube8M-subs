he was symbolizing something

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440

it<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.160> his<00:00:32.430> cabinet<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:32.969> background<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it was his cabinet in the background and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
it was his cabinet in the background and
it<00:00:33.540> got<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:33.930> attention<00:00:34.020> from<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.219> design<00:00:35.610> how

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
it got my attention from the design how

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.420 
it got my attention from the design how
it<00:00:36.059> looked<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.140> away<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it looked like right away and it's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180 
it looked like right away and it's
because<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.850> one-piece<00:00:39.450> construction<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because it's one-piece construction so I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
because it's one-piece construction so I
cannot<00:00:41.460> he<00:00:41.700> did<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> sticker<00:00:43.020> sign

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cannot he did there was a sticker sign

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
cannot he did there was a sticker sign

one-piece<00:01:10.740> construction<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.580> no

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
one-piece construction so we have no

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
one-piece construction so we have no
seals<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.450> leak<00:01:12.630> through<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.470> body<00:01:13.710> itself

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
seals to leak through on the body itself

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
seals to leak through on the body itself
which<00:01:14.460> happens<00:01:14.939> often<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> Sebastian

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
which happens often with the Sebastian

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.590 
which happens often with the Sebastian
cabinet<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> reviews<00:01:18.390> very

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
cabinet you see it in the reviews very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.520 
cabinet you see it in the reviews very
often<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.909> problem<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.320> top

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
often the only only problem is the top

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.340 
often the only only problem is the top
glass<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.520> top<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.689> always<00:01:24.960> leak

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
glass the top thing and then always leak

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
glass the top thing and then always leak
somehow<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> big

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
somehow and as you see there is a big

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280 
somehow and as you see there is a big
step<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.829> filled<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> phone<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
step of filled with the phone and it's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
step of filled with the phone and it's
not<00:01:31.470> closed<00:01:31.770> off<00:01:31.950> completely<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
not closed off completely so you have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
not closed off completely so you have
kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> filter<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
kind of like a filter in the back it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
kind of like a filter in the back it's
not<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> filter<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.880> mesh<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
not a filter it's just a little mesh so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.050 
not a filter it's just a little mesh so
the<00:01:37.049> air<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.380> escape<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:38.100> why<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the air can escape that's why you see I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
the air can escape that's why you see I
hooked<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.740> collector<00:01:41.250> system

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
hooked up that that's collector system

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
hooked up that that's collector system
right<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> blow<00:01:43.439> out

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
right there so it's going to blow out

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.440 
right there so it's going to blow out
there<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> dust<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.240> there

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
there the dust it will go right in there

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
there the dust it will go right in there
and<00:01:45.479> there's<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.320> more<00:01:46.560> hole<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and there's one more hole there which I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.100 
and there's one more hole there which I
just<00:01:47.790> connect<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> running<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
just connect that it's not the running I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.319 
just connect that it's not the running I
can<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.710> run<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:50.970> there

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
can actually run it but it's just there

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.030 
can actually run it but it's just there
to<00:01:51.689> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> plug<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> hole<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to kind of plug the hole and it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
to kind of plug the hole and it's
probably<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:54.479> much<00:01:54.600> same<00:01:54.899> thing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
probably for the pretty much same thing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.480 
probably for the pretty much same thing
like<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> lot<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> times

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
like that there you know a lot of times

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
like that there you know a lot of times
people<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> sank

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
people that do work with the sank

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190 
people that do work with the sank
sandblasters<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.939> v<00:02:00.060> blossoms<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.170> a

sandblasters or v blossoms they have a
filtration<00:02:01.530> system<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
filtration system we just kind of just

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.800 
filtration system we just kind of just
friends<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.869> vacuum<00:02:04.350> machine<00:02:05.329> hooked<00:02:06.329> up<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
friends your vacuum machine hooked up to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
friends your vacuum machine hooked up to
the<00:02:06.930> system<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.220> ones<00:02:08.459> where<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the system actually have ones where the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.999 
the system actually have ones where the
vacuum<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.690> sure<00:02:09.810> somehow<00:02:10.110> collects<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
vacuum make sure somehow collects the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.430 
vacuum make sure somehow collects the
dust<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.849> dump<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> back

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
dust so you can just dump it back

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.080 
dust so you can just dump it back
can<00:02:12.590> we<00:02:12.890> try<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> rather<00:02:13.370> could<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.880> right

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
can we try that rather could do right

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.600 
can we try that rather could do right
there<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.600> could<00:02:14.960> do<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.410> wanted<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.770> or<00:02:16.490> if

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
there I could do it if I wanted to or if

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.330 
there I could do it if I wanted to or if
I<00:02:16.730> didn't<00:02:17.330> use<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.530> vacuum<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.710> other<00:02:18.950> other

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
I didn't use that vacuum for other other

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.030 
I didn't use that vacuum for other other
stuff<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.850> but<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.570> if<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.810> really<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.650> it's

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
stuff go but so if I really like it it's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.730 
stuff go but so if I really like it it's
so<00:02:22.220> much<00:02:22.670> better<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.420> gun<00:02:23.960> itself<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.650> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
so much better the gun itself and the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.920 
so much better the gun itself and the
way<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.070> beam<00:02:25.250> works<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.390> much<00:02:26.540> better<00:02:26.600> than

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
way the beam works so much better than

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.610 
way the beam works so much better than
the<00:02:27.080> old<00:02:27.230> one

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the old one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.160 
the old one
also<00:02:28.130> nice<00:02:28.280> thing<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.850> simple<00:02:29.360> regular

but we have the I always buy the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 
but we have the I always buy the
fluorescent<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.150> there's<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.240> fluorescence

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
fluorescent so there's a fluorescence

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.120 
fluorescent so there's a fluorescence
hopefully<00:02:48.260> children<00:02:48.620> shouldn't<00:02:48.920> cut

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130

good<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:54.890> far<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.160> ran<00:02:55.700> couple<00:02:56.030> pairs<00:02:56.210> with

good so far I ran couple pairs with

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.200 
good so far I ran couple pairs with
steel<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.720> titanium<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:58.490> much<00:02:58.910> better

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210

do it since then so in what four or five
months<00:03:49.519> something<00:03:50.060> like<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.709> three<00:03:51.709> four

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
months something like that three four

months something like that three four
months<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:53.290> me<00:03:54.290> working<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.220> shop<00:03:55.459> every

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
months of me working in the shop every

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.810 
months of me working in the shop every
day<00:03:56.000> they<00:03:56.930> were<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.440> two<00:03:57.620> tanks<00:03:58.160> there<00:03:58.489> was

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
day they were in the two tanks there was

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.509 
day they were in the two tanks there was
pretty<00:03:59.150> much<00:03:59.239> like<00:04:00.050> gone<00:04:00.410> two<00:04:00.830> gallons<00:04:01.340> of

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
pretty much like gone two gallons of

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.400 
pretty much like gone two gallons of
liquid<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.330> bottom<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> tanks<00:04:03.200> we're

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
liquid on the bottom of the tanks we're

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.900 
liquid on the bottom of the tanks we're
just<00:04:03.620> insane<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.580> is<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:04.910> lot<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.610> have<00:04:07.880> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
just insane that is a lot so I have a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.790 
just insane that is a lot so I have a
few<00:04:08.150> here<00:04:08.420> filled<00:04:08.810> air<00:04:09.110> and

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
few here filled air and

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.170 
few here filled air and
they<00:04:09.950> have<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.190> do<00:04:10.280> domain<00:04:10.580> things<00:04:10.790> more<00:04:11.000> often

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
they have to do domain things more often

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.300 
they have to do domain things more often
because<00:04:11.510> it's<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:11.930> too<00:04:12.080> much<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.560> do<00:04:12.950> suspect

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
because it's just too much I do suspect

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.449 
because it's just too much I do suspect
that<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.760> lot<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.360> because<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that a lot of it is because of the

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.120 
that a lot of it is because of the
because<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.880> cool<00:04:17.450> mist<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.890> gets

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
because of the cool mist that it gets

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.920 
because of the cool mist that it gets
the<00:04:19.250> backdrop<00:04:19.700> when<00:04:19.880> I'm<00:04:19.970> doing<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.390> same

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the backdrop when I'm doing the same

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.600 
the backdrop when I'm doing the same
blasting<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.470> kind<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.769> maybe<00:04:21.920> backdraft

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
blasting it kind of maybe backdraft

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.180 
blasting it kind of maybe backdraft
liquid<00:04:23.480> from<00:04:23.690> there<00:04:23.930> into<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.650> house<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
liquid from there into the house you

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.980 
liquid from there into the house you
know<00:04:25.340> kind<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.640> like<00:04:25.790> put<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.510> there<00:04:26.750> and

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
know kind of like put it in there and

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.230 
know kind of like put it in there and
then<00:04:27.170> back<00:04:27.410> into<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> air<00:04:27.920> system<00:04:28.160> air<00:04:29.030> hoses

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
then back into the air system air hoses

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.720 
then back into the air system air hoses
all<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.050> way<00:04:30.170> back<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> compressor<00:04:31.190> but

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
all the way back to the compressor but

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.910 
all the way back to the compressor but
I'm<00:04:32.030> not<00:04:32.600> sure<00:04:32.840> I'm<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.050> respecting<00:04:33.590> it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
I'm not sure I'm just respecting it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.650 
I'm not sure I'm just respecting it
because<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.280> liquid<00:04:34.430> in<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.730> tanks<00:04:35.090> was<00:04:35.360> kind

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
because the liquid in the tanks was kind

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.200 
because the liquid in the tanks was kind
of<00:04:35.750> whitish<00:04:35.960> which<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.770> cooling<00:04:37.640> liquid<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:38.030> use

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
of whitish which is cooling liquid I use

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.960 
of whitish which is cooling liquid I use
for<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.500> another<00:04:39.710> reason<00:04:39.980> why<00:04:40.460> what<00:04:40.940> I

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
for that so another reason why what I

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
for that so another reason why what I
did<00:04:41.420> next<00:04:42.290> was<00:04:44.080> actually<00:04:45.850> bypass<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.660> little

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
did next was actually bypass the little

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.450 
did next was actually bypass the little
mouse<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.800> there

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
mouse on there

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.410 
mouse on there
the<00:04:49.730> on/off<00:04:50.290> screw<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.650> left<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.550> open<00:04:52.790> but<00:04:53.360> I

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
the on/off screw I left that open but I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.350 
the on/off screw I left that open but I
put<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.780> regular<00:04:53.990> valve<00:04:54.710> there<00:04:55.160> first<00:04:55.760> off<00:04:55.970> it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
put the regular valve there first off it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.900 
put the regular valve there first off it
is<00:04:56.630> just<00:04:56.660> annoying<00:04:57.410> after<00:04:57.950> all<00:04:58.100> day<00:04:58.400> with

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
is just annoying after all day with

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.340 
is just annoying after all day with
fingers<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.780> when<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.050> kind<00:05:00.230> of

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
fingers you know when that kind of

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.230 
fingers you know when that kind of
sleeper<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.770> little<00:05:01.070> bit<00:05:01.220> from<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.910> cooling

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
sleeper a little bit from the cooling

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.660 
sleeper a little bit from the cooling
system<00:05:02.600> coolant<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.740> turn<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.340> little<00:05:04.520> knob

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
system coolant to turn the little knob

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.090 
system coolant to turn the little knob
here<00:05:04.820> so<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:05.840> know<00:05:06.050> just<00:05:06.350> regular<00:05:06.470> small

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
was a good grinder water cooling system

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.350 
was a good grinder water cooling system
is<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.070> second<00:05:22.430> best<00:05:22.669> thing<00:05:22.820> for<00:05:23.150> the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000 
is the second best thing for the
grinding<00:05:23.810> steel<00:05:24.110> for<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.530> working<00:05:24.710> with<00:05:24.950> the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
grinding steel for the working with the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.040 
grinding steel for the working with the
steel<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.340> combine<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:26.210> is<00:05:26.360> just<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:26.810> good

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
steel you combine it is just that good

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.320 
steel you combine it is just that good
trust<00:05:27.440> if<00:05:27.710> you're<00:05:27.860> doing<00:05:28.040> you<00:05:28.400> know<00:05:28.550> if<00:05:29.150> you

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
trust if you're doing you know if you

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.650 
trust if you're doing you know if you
want<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.630> work<00:05:29.780> fast<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:31.280> wanna<00:05:32.270> have<00:05:32.450> a

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
want to work fast and and wanna have a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.870 
want to work fast and and wanna have a
guarantee<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.380> not<00:05:33.770> overheating<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.460> really

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
guarantee of not overheating it really

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.980 
guarantee of not overheating it really
is<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.210> important<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:37.390> that's<00:05:38.390> it<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.930> know

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
is that important and that's it you know

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.560 
is that important and that's it you know
that<00:05:39.290> thing<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:40.580> that<00:05:40.820> should<00:05:40.970> actually<00:05:41.090> stop

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
that thing so that should actually stop

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.040 
that thing so that should actually stop
anything<00:05:42.430> possible<00:05:43.430> going<00:05:44.120> back<00:05:44.450> drive<00:05:44.750> there

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
anything possible going back drive there

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.320 
anything possible going back drive there
plus<00:05:45.650> easier<00:05:46.100> for<00:05:46.340> me<00:05:46.460> turning<00:05:46.850> on<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.240> off

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
plus easier for me turning on and off

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.290 
plus easier for me turning on and off
and<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.169> think<00:05:48.470> so<00:05:49.040> far<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.640> I<00:05:49.730> said<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.090> far

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
and I think so far like I said so far

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.860 
and I think so far like I said so far
I'm<00:05:50.390> impressed

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
I'm impressed

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.220 
I'm impressed
see<00:05:51.560> I'll<00:05:51.800> see<00:05:52.100> how<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.310> goes<00:05:52.840> another<00:05:53.840> thing<00:05:54.140> I

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
see I'll see how it goes another thing I

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.500 
see I'll see how it goes another thing I
have<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.470> take<00:05:54.650> care<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.890> have<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.610> get<00:05:55.820> extra

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
have to take care of have to get extra

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.270 
have to take care of have to get extra
the<00:05:57.430> they're<00:05:58.430> like<00:05:58.700> a<00:05:58.810> plastic<00:05:59.810> cover<00:06:00.280> lens

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
the they're like a plastic cover lens

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.030 
the they're like a plastic cover lens
let's<00:06:01.940> say<00:06:02.120> lens<00:06:02.419> kind<00:06:02.780> of<00:06:02.960> plastic<00:06:03.440> on<00:06:03.830> the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
let's say lens kind of plastic on the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.560 
let's say lens kind of plastic on the
bottom<00:06:04.160> of<00:06:04.460> it<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:04.610> I<00:06:04.790> have<00:06:04.940> to<00:06:05.060> get<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.270> couple

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
bottom of it so I have to get a couple

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.390 
bottom of it so I have to get a couple
more<00:06:05.690> of<00:06:05.750> those<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.320> when<00:06:06.500> that<00:06:06.740> one<00:06:06.980> goes<00:06:07.160> but

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
more of those so when that one goes but

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.430 
more of those so when that one goes but
I<00:06:07.430> can<00:06:07.669> replace<00:06:07.970> it<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.330> not<00:06:08.540> mess<00:06:08.750> up<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
I can replace it and not mess up the the

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.500 
I can replace it and not mess up the the
plastic<00:06:09.680> glass<00:06:10.100> but<00:06:10.700> also<00:06:10.850> as<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.300> see

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
plastic glass but also as you see

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.780 
plastic glass but also as you see
another<00:06:11.900> nice<00:06:12.140> thing<00:06:12.440> about<00:06:12.470> even<00:06:13.340> if<00:06:13.460> you<00:06:13.580> do

that<00:06:28.880> is<00:06:29.539> by<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.810> way<00:06:30.020> about<00:06:31.390> 170,000<00:06:32.390> I<00:06:32.510> think

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
that is by the way about 170,000 I think

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.080 
that is by the way about 170,000 I think
something<00:06:33.530> like<00:06:33.650> that<00:06:33.860> so<00:06:34.010> it<00:06:34.130> is<00:06:34.190> about<00:06:34.520> it's

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
something like that so it is about it's

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.420 
something like that so it is about it's
almost<00:06:35.330> twice<00:06:35.600> twice<00:06:36.229> the<00:06:36.410> money<00:06:36.590> of<00:06:36.860> the<00:06:36.890> my

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
almost twice twice the money of the my

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.480 
almost twice twice the money of the my
previous<00:06:37.850> one<00:06:38.169> but<00:06:39.169> it's<00:06:39.410> pretty<00:06:39.620> good<00:06:39.919> the

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
previous one but it's pretty good the

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.480 
previous one but it's pretty good the
legs<00:06:40.729> are<00:06:40.910> hollow<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.960> the<00:06:42.380> it<00:06:42.710> can<00:06:42.950> collect

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
legs are hollow the the it can collect

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.330 
legs are hollow the the it can collect
there<00:06:43.789> but<00:06:44.479> nice<00:06:45.289> thing<00:06:45.590> is<00:06:45.770> compared<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.280> the

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
there but nice thing is compared to the

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.000 
there but nice thing is compared to the
other<00:06:46.430> one<00:06:46.640> it<00:06:47.210> comes<00:06:48.020> to<00:06:48.169> the<00:06:48.289> corn

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
other one it comes to the corn

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.340 
other one it comes to the corn
altogether<00:06:49.910> the<00:06:50.330> other<00:06:50.479> one<00:06:50.630> was<00:06:50.810> just<00:06:50.840> kinda

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
altogether the other one was just kinda

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.350 
altogether the other one was just kinda
like<00:06:51.380> that<00:06:51.710> way<00:06:51.950> it<00:06:52.400> didn't<00:06:52.729> come<00:06:52.940> from<00:06:53.150> the

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
like that way it didn't come from the

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.480 
like that way it didn't come from the
side<00:06:53.630> as<00:06:53.840> well<00:06:54.020> so<00:06:54.260> it<00:06:54.380> collects<00:06:55.100> right<00:06:55.340> there

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
side as well so it collects right there

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.370 
side as well so it collects right there
and<00:06:55.669> there's<00:06:55.850> a<00:06:55.910> the<00:06:57.039> the<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:59.240> suction<00:06:59.810> pipe

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
and there's a the the the suction pipe

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.350 
and there's a the the the suction pipe
goes<00:07:00.800> all<00:07:01.039> the<00:07:01.070> way<00:07:01.190> down<00:07:01.280> so<00:07:01.700> pretty<00:07:02.270> much

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
goes all the way down so pretty much

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.719 
goes all the way down so pretty much
guarantee<00:07:02.810> that<00:07:02.840> always<00:07:03.410> gonna<00:07:03.620> get<00:07:03.890> fed<00:07:04.550> it

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
guarantee that always gonna get fed it

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.460 
guarantee that always gonna get fed it
down<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.090> the<00:07:05.180> bottom<00:07:05.360> where<00:07:05.930> it's<00:07:06.050> sucking<00:07:06.260> up

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
down to the bottom where it's sucking up
