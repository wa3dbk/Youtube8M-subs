that's<00:01:10.920> often<00:01:11.920> these<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.189> most<00:01:12.310> coverage<00:01:12.820> is

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
that's often these the most coverage is

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.609 
that's often these the most coverage is
the<00:01:13.630> area<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:13.960> tends<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.259> have<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.409> lot<00:01:14.590> of

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
the area that tends to have a lot of

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.770 
the area that tends to have a lot of
redness<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.970> start<00:01:16.270> there

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
redness if you start there

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.350 
redness if you start there
and<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.500> blend<00:01:17.740> out<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.820> don't<00:01:19.090> need<00:01:19.210> as

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
and then blend out and don't need as

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:34.860 
and then blend out and don't need as
much<00:01:19.539> coverage<00:01:19.899> around<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.920> outside

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.330 

so<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> matte<00:01:36.410> finish<00:01:36.590> foundation

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
so this is a matte finish foundation

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.940 
so this is a matte finish foundation
which<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.520> perfect<00:01:38.120> if<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.870> saw<00:01:39.050> some<00:01:39.350> oily
