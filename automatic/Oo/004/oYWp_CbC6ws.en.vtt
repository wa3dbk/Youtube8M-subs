this<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.179> demonstrate<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:04.200> little

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
this video is to demonstrate a little

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.000 
this video is to demonstrate a little
bit<00:00:04.830> more<00:00:05.250> detail<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.720> use<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:06.990> scenes<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
bit more detail on the use of scenes and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.980 
bit more detail on the use of scenes and
layers<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.460> their<00:00:08.820> association<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.540> finishing

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
layers of their association in finishing

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.070 
layers of their association in finishing
the<00:00:10.139> drawing<00:00:10.730> if<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.910> look<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.480> model<00:00:12.780> we

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the drawing if you look at this model we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.350 
the drawing if you look at this model we
have<00:00:13.259> three<00:00:13.920> different<00:00:14.219> unique<00:00:14.790> parts<00:00:15.179> we

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
have three different unique parts we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.109 
have three different unique parts we
have<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> top<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.650> cross<00:00:16.920> bar<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.670> end<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
have a top the cross bar and an end I

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.880 
have a top the cross bar and an end I
have<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.510> ends<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.230> treating<00:00:19.590> those<00:00:19.710> as

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
have two ends but I'm treating those as

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.599 
have two ends but I'm treating those as
one<00:00:20.039> part<00:00:20.340> since<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.270> design

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
one part since it's just one design

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
one part since it's just one design
we'll<00:00:23.609> open<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> entity<00:00:24.500> information

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
we'll open up the entity information

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.689 
we'll open up the entity information
window<00:00:26.330> if<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.449> click<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.349> end<00:00:28.699> you'll

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
window if I click on the end you'll

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
window if I click on the end you'll
notice<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.619> put<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.099> on

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
notice that that is on I put that on

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
notice that that is on I put that on
layer<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> also<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.309> layer<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:36.290> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
layer a this one is also on layer a the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.850 
layer a this one is also on layer a the
cross<00:00:37.590> bar<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.399> layer<00:00:38.640> B<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> top<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
cross bar is on layer B and the top is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.639 
cross bar is on layer B and the top is
on<00:00:41.190> layer<00:00:41.399> C<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.149> each<00:00:42.480> individual<00:00:43.110> part<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.530> on

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
on layer C so each individual part is on

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
on layer C so each individual part is on
a<00:00:43.680> separate<00:00:44.129> layer<00:00:45.469> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> IPB

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a separate layer if you look at the IPB

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.610 
a separate layer if you look at the IPB
art<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> APB<00:00:50.600> we<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.870> these<00:00:52.199> three

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
art at the I APB we have these three

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.290 
art at the I APB we have these three
parts<00:00:53.039> plus<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.760> text<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.090> call-outs<00:00:57.090> on

parts plus the text for the call-outs on

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
parts plus the text for the call-outs on
that<00:00:57.420> part<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> layers<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that part if we look at the layers that

that part if we look at the layers that
are<00:00:59.309> being<00:00:59.579> displayed<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.600> layer<00:01:00.930> a

contains the text for this view if you
will<00:01:27.990> notice<00:01:28.430> we<00:01:29.430> view<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> assembly<00:01:30.509> view

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
will notice we view the assembly view

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.069 
will notice we view the assembly view
and<00:01:32.479> layers<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.720> B<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> C<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:35.070> invisible<00:01:35.869> but<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and layers a B and C are invisible but I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.090 
and layers a B and C are invisible but I
PB<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.009> turned<00:01:38.460> off<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.270> visible

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
PB one is turned off it is not visible

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.749 
PB one is turned off it is not visible
so<00:01:41.479> by<00:01:42.530> putting<00:01:43.530> things<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.130> unique<00:01:44.430> layers

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so by putting things in unique layers

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
so by putting things in unique layers
and<00:01:45.180> controlling<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.259> layers<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.740> visible

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and controlling which layers are visible

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.830 
and controlling which layers are visible
in<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.520> scenes<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.270> create<00:01:48.540> multiple

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
in which scenes I can create multiple

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.270 
in which scenes I can create multiple
views<00:01:50.119> again<00:01:51.320> we'll<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> assembly

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
views again we'll look at the assembly

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
views again we'll look at the assembly
view<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.110> layers<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.649> B<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.009> C<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.049> to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.559 
you'll notice this text is on a text
layer<00:02:25.880> likewise<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.270> go<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.950> scene<00:02:28.950> B<00:02:29.340> only<00:02:30.300> B
