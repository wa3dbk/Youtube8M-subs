00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
back in December of 1979 I had published

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
back in December of 1979 I had published
an<00:00:08.069> article<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.910> railroad<00:00:09.300> model

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
an article in the railroad model

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.750 
an article in the railroad model
craftsman<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.980> construction<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.640> a

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
craftsman about the construction of a

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.660 
craftsman about the construction of a
rotary<00:00:12.120> dumper<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.740> had<00:00:13.740> seen<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.100> ad<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.520> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
rotary dumper I had seen an ad in the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
rotary dumper I had seen an ad in the
railway<00:00:15.030> Age<00:00:15.269> magazine<00:00:15.840> back<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> 70s<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
railway Age magazine back in the 70s and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
railway Age magazine back in the 70s and
this<00:00:17.699> rotary<00:00:18.060> dumper<00:00:18.420> looked<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> was

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
this rotary dumper looked like it was

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.140 
this rotary dumper looked like it was
easily<00:00:19.500> modelled<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.250> made<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> work<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
easily modelled and made to work in a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240 
easily modelled and made to work in a
Cho<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:22.320> been<00:00:22.500> able<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.770> do<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
Cho and I've been able to do that

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.370 
Cho and I've been able to do that
so<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.030> stumpers<00:00:24.390> been<00:00:24.539> working<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.110> over

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so the stumpers been working for over

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.510 
so the stumpers been working for over
three<00:00:26.250> decades<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.199> now<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.410> jam<00:00:29.250> or<00:00:29.460> I

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
three decades now and now I use jam or I

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.130 
three decades now and now I use jam or I
to<00:00:29.580> control<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.570> I'll<00:00:30.750> show<00:00:30.930> you<00:00:30.990> how

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to control it so I'll show you how

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
to control it so I'll show you how
that's<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.579> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> just

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that's done but first I want to just

00:00:32.940 --> 00:01:09.050 
that's done but first I want to just
show<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> dumper<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.949> operation

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.609 

I<00:01:09.149> have<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.899> dumper<00:01:10.200> controlled<00:01:10.649> now<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
I have the dumper controlled now by a

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.389 
I have the dumper controlled now by a
lens<00:01:13.619> decoder<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.420> EMF<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
lens decoder with back EMF and I have a

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.330 
lens decoder with back EMF and I have a
flat<00:01:17.759> speed<00:01:18.119> table<00:01:18.539> programmed<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> going

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
flat speed table programmed in so going

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
flat speed table programmed in so going
up<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.789> down<00:01:20.820> whether<00:01:21.329> it's<00:01:21.450> limited<00:01:21.990> or

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
up or down whether it's limited or

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
up or down whether it's limited or
unloaded<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.829> like<00:01:23.250> cruise<00:01:23.549> control<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
unloaded it's like cruise control it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
unloaded it's like cruise control it
works<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.659> well<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:25.229> easier<00:01:25.619> than<00:01:25.799> using

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
works very well much easier than using

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
works very well much easier than using
diodes<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> resistors<00:01:27.479> under<00:01:28.439> DC<00:01:33.710> since<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
diodes and resistors under DC since the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
diodes and resistors under DC since the
dumper<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.220> controlled<00:01:35.970> by<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.420> locomotive

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
dumper is controlled by that locomotive

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
dumper is controlled by that locomotive
decoder<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.429> could<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.729> controlled<00:01:39.630> by<00:01:39.810> J<00:01:40.079> MRI

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
decoder it could be controlled by J MRI

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.320 
decoder it could be controlled by J MRI
as<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.940> put<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> couple

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
as well and I was going to put a couple

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.139 
as well and I was going to put a couple
of<00:01:42.509> switches<00:01:43.259> over<00:01:43.289> here<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.190> bash<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of switches over here on the bash of the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.820 
of switches over here on the bash of the
layout<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.539> control<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.440> thought<00:01:46.619> wait

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
layout and control it and I thought wait

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.980 
layout and control it and I thought wait
I've<00:01:47.640> got<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> control<00:01:48.240> panel<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I've got a control panel here on the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.130 
I've got a control panel here on the
tablet<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:52.020> I'll

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
tablet that can do this and so here I'll

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
tablet that can do this and so here I'll
tilt<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.610> 10<00:01:54.539> inch<00:01:54.569> tablet

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
tilt this up this is a 10 inch tablet

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.520 
tilt this up this is a 10 inch tablet
and<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:56.069> shown<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.959> Quaker<00:01:57.959> Junction

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and it's shown you the Quaker Junction

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.339 
and it's shown you the Quaker Junction
panel<00:01:59.069> here<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.539> what<00:02:00.539> I've<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
panel here and what I've got down at the

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.740 
panel here and what I've got down at the
bottom<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> panel<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:03.119> couple<00:02:03.539> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
bottom of the panel are a couple of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.529 
bottom of the panel are a couple of
switches<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.380> those<00:02:05.369> switches<00:02:05.700> control<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
switches and those switches control the

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.529 
switches and those switches control the
rotary<00:02:07.049> dumper<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.179> touching<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> switch

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
rotary dumper so touching this switch

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.410 
rotary dumper so touching this switch
here<00:02:09.899> shuts<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.099> dumper<00:02:11.489> basically

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
here shuts off the dumper basically

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
here shuts off the dumper basically
shutting<00:02:12.780> down<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.049> locomotive<00:02:13.680> turning<00:02:14.070> out

you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.150> see<00:03:06.329> but<00:03:06.569> there's<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> headlight

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you can see but there's a headlight

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.229 
you can see but there's a headlight
that's<00:03:08.010> come<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.609> it's<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> lower

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
that's come on it's in the lower

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.440 
that's come on it's in the lower
position<00:03:09.510> when<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> turn<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
position when we go to turn it to the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.740 
position when we go to turn it to the
upper<00:03:12.840> position<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:14.819> headlight<00:03:15.150> goes<00:03:15.359> to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
upper position that headlight goes to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.100 
upper position that headlight goes to
the<00:03:16.909> opposite<00:03:17.909> direction<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:18.659> can<00:03:18.900> kind

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the opposite direction so you can kind

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.619 
the opposite direction so you can kind
of<00:03:19.140> see<00:03:19.349> that<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.890> we'll<00:03:20.760> move<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:21.000> car<00:03:21.239> up<00:03:21.390> into

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
of see that so we'll move a car up into

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.430 
of see that so we'll move a car up into
position<00:03:21.750> here

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
position here

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:40.650 
position here
do<00:03:22.530> another<00:03:22.910> operation<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.180> dumper

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:04:13.160 

cars<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.840> position<00:03:44.020> start<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> dumper<00:03:45.470> up

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.990 

so<00:04:13.740> there's<00:04:13.920> lots<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.340> things<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.640> can<00:04:14.850> do

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
so there's lots of things you can do

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
with a MRI and the panel pro editor and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.239 
with a MRI and the panel pro editor and
editors<00:04:19.430> use<00:04:20.430> your<00:04:20.579> imagination
