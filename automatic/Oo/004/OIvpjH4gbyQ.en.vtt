00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.280
 200 meters of men of the second time half up 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.759
 maybe not everything is possible Sebastian Ernst five hundredths 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.550
 Seconds are missing this year for the German record on the outside line 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.669
 Prenzlauer is there he comes on the last stage 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.579
 more clearly in the lead Sebastian Ernst 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.579
 wait 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.060
 already words for what happened today 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 that's what it is for 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 have seven players 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 clearer last but if the deal that better 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 how bitter is it now because Obama situation should be drawn 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.650
 Pipa SUT 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.140
 would do 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510
 again 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.590
 although neither and no role 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 if you can break in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 how much electricity is traded and our column for the outdoor season report 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.480
 about the immediate 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.040
 and that still lasts 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 So never enjoy this German record like this with her 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.689
 Ladies and gentlemen Sebastian Ernst 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.769
 with an incredible who's here
