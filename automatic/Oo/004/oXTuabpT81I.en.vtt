00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.589
 This tutorial will teach you how to make 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 a nice origami tie as it is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.519
 well let's see how it is done what 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.010
 we will need to make this tie 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.620
 will be two squares of paper of the same 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.780
 color and full size 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.260
 first we will take a square of 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.690
 paper and what we will do is double it 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 the diagonal in this way and we unfold 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.710
 we take the tip to the center 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.769
 and this other tip likewise the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.769
 we take to the center 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 we push 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.829
 we unfold the tips and take the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.329
 tips 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.150
 about our fold we've made 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.830
 thus 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.830
 we do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 already bent the tips what we will do 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.110
 it will be again doubled 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.570
 getting this figure 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.180
 well what we will do is leave this figure 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.690
 a moment on the one hand and we will take the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.360
 another square bending the for the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.759
 diagonal 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 we unfold and we will carry these two 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.470
 tips on the center 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.270
 in this way we carry the other 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.490
 and we press well then 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 we took the figure we had already made 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.850
 and this tip we will place on the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:54.350
 line that we have to the center like this already when 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.540
 let's have that tip we'll take this and 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.540
 the tip will bend backwards 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.579
 in this way we doubled this figure 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.290
 obtaining this below what 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:15.269
 we will do will bend these two points 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.269
 in such a way that it is centered 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.050
 in this way when we see that they are already 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.050
 centered the tips we press 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 and we will double 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.920
 these two points inwards 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.580
 in this way well and finally we have already 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.320
 finished our origami tie 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.930
