a half ago and that eventually led to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.229 
a half ago and that eventually led to

the implementation of the system here in

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.200 
the implementation of the system here in
about<00:01:06.020> September<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.530> last<00:01:06.650> year<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:07.610> plastic

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
about September of last year so plastic

about September of last year so plastic
starts<00:01:08.630> out<00:01:08.810> as<00:01:09.710> oil<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:10.490> oil<00:01:10.520> byproducts

starts out as oil or oil byproducts

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.710 
starts out as oil or oil byproducts
which<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.650> carbon<00:01:13.580> molecule<00:01:13.700> chain<00:01:14.300> about

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
which have a carbon molecule chain about

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.270 
which have a carbon molecule chain about
eight<00:01:15.020> or<00:01:15.170> nine<00:01:15.200> long<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.860> during<00:01:16.220> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
eight or nine long and during the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.190 
eight or nine long and during the
process<00:01:16.400> of<00:01:16.850> making<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.450> plastic<00:01:17.900> those<00:01:18.080> are

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
process of making the plastic those are

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200 
process of making the plastic those are
combined<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:19.130> order<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.490> make<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> chain

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
combined in order to make a chain

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.880 
combined in order to make a chain
roughly<00:01:20.900> about<00:01:21.020> twenty-eight<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.590> carbon

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
roughly about twenty-eight to carbon

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.430 
roughly about twenty-eight to carbon
molecules<00:01:22.340> long<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.210> we're<00:01:23.360> doing<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.930> we

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
molecules long so what we're doing is we

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.150 
molecules long so what we're doing is we
are<00:01:24.710> chopping<00:01:25.370> those<00:01:25.670> chains<00:01:26.360> back<00:01:26.810> into<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
are chopping those chains back into the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.180 
are chopping those chains back into the
shorts<00:01:28.550> eight<00:01:29.300> or<00:01:29.450> nine<00:01:29.570> molecule<00:01:30.230> chains<00:01:30.530> in

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
shorts eight or nine molecule chains in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.310 
shorts eight or nine molecule chains in
order<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.550> create<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.910> oil<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.990> output<00:01:33.290> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
order to create the oil the output of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.940 
order to create the oil the output of
the<00:01:33.440> plus<00:01:33.620> Pro<00:01:33.890> machine<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:35.480> synthetic<00:01:36.110> mix

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the plus Pro machine is a synthetic mix

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.130 
the plus Pro machine is a synthetic mix
light<00:01:37.340> crude<00:01:37.730> oil<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.300> basically<00:01:38.720> very

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
light crude oil so it's basically very

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.380 
light crude oil so it's basically very
similar<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.860> diesel<00:01:39.980> how<00:01:40.730> much<00:01:40.850> some<00:01:41.060> gasoline

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
similar to diesel how much some gasoline

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.970 
similar to diesel how much some gasoline
it<00:01:41.600> is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
it is

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.510 
it is
but<00:01:42.580> when<00:01:43.300> we<00:01:43.390> mix<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.810> with<00:01:44.620> diesel<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.400> be

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
but when we mix it with diesel it can be

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.600 
but when we mix it with diesel it can be
burned<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.300> regular<00:01:47.080> furnace<00:01:47.290> or<00:01:47.710> yeah

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
burned in a regular furnace or yeah

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.120 
burned in a regular furnace or yeah
actually<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.180> diesel<00:01:49.600> engine<00:01:50.020> as<00:01:50.140> well<00:01:50.260> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
actually in a diesel engine as well the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.220 
actually in a diesel engine as well the
different<00:01:51.490> phases<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.940> Machine<00:01:52.210> goes<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.780> is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
different phases the Machine goes to is

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.740 
different phases the Machine goes to is
first<00:01:53.830> off<00:01:54.040> we<00:01:54.340> take<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> plastic<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.540> comes

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
first off we take the plastic that comes

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.370 
first off we take the plastic that comes
in<00:01:56.020> from<00:01:57.150> mixed<00:01:58.150> recycling<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.900> goes<00:01:59.110> through

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
in from mixed recycling it goes through

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.400 
in from mixed recycling it goes through
granulator<00:01:59.920> which<00:02:00.430> reduces<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.420> size<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
granulator which reduces the size and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.760 
granulator which reduces the size and
then<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:03.040> conveyor<00:02:03.580> transports<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.500> into<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
then the conveyor transports it into the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.560 
then the conveyor transports it into the
load<00:02:05.920> cell<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> machine<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.270> then<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
load cell of the machine and then it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.530 
load cell of the machine and then it
goes<00:02:07.750> into<00:02:07.990> an<00:02:08.260> extruder<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.400 
chambers is where the temperature is
brought<00:02:14.170> up<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.710> 450<00:02:15.310> degrees<00:02:15.340> Celsius<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.410> at

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
brought up to 450 degrees Celsius and at

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.310 
brought up to 450 degrees Celsius and at
that<00:02:17.980> point<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.430> 450<00:02:18.970> degrees<00:02:19.000> Celsius<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
that point at 450 degrees Celsius the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.720 
that point at 450 degrees Celsius the
plastic<00:02:20.800> starts<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.100> break<00:02:21.250> down<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
plastic starts to break down and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.050 
plastic starts to break down and
pyrolyze<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.290> then<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> condenser<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
pyrolyze and then in the condenser the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.000 
pyrolyze and then in the condenser the
temperature<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.570> brought<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.320> thought

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
temperature is brought down and thought

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.130 
temperature is brought down and thought
pyrolized<00:02:27.550> gas<00:02:27.760> condenses<00:02:28.390> into<00:02:28.540> oil<00:02:28.780> which

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
pyrolized gas condenses into oil which

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.410 
pyrolized gas condenses into oil which
collects<00:02:29.650> into<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.010> offtake<00:02:30.310> tanker<00:02:30.670> one<00:02:31.300> of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
collects into the offtake tanker one of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
collects into the offtake tanker one of
the<00:02:31.480> other<00:02:31.600> advantages<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.470> machine<00:02:32.860> is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the other advantages of this machine is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.030 
the other advantages of this machine is
that<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.810> lower<00:02:35.530> carbon

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that it is actually lower carbon

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.120 
that it is actually lower carbon
emissions<00:02:36.100> than<00:02:37.030> recycling<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:38.130> incineration

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
emissions than recycling or incineration

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.340 
emissions than recycling or incineration
so<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:39.910> machine<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.330> output<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.750> maximum<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
so this machine can output a maximum of

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.980 
so this machine can output a maximum of
10<00:02:41.560> liters<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:42.190> oil<00:02:42.310> per<00:02:42.760> hour<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.870> real

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
10 liters of oil per hour so it's a real

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.470 
10 liters of oil per hour so it's a real
simple<00:02:44.260> equation<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.070> works<00:02:45.280> out<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.550> one

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
simple equation that works out to one

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.900 
simple equation that works out to one
kilogram<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.930> plastic<00:02:47.470> plus<00:02:48.160> one<00:02:48.459> kilowatt

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
kilogram of plastic plus one kilowatt

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.150 
kilogram of plastic plus one kilowatt
hour<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.480> electricity<00:02:49.709> equals<00:02:50.709> one<00:02:50.860> liter<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
hour of electricity equals one liter of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.090 
hour of electricity equals one liter of
oil<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:52.240> 12<00:02:52.420> cents<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.810> liter<00:02:52.990> oil<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.920> is

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
oil so for 12 cents a liter oil that is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.340 
oil so for 12 cents a liter oil that is
pretty<00:02:54.430> darn<00:02:54.640> cheap<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.540> funding<00:02:56.140> came

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
pretty darn cheap the funding came

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.840 
pretty darn cheap the funding came
