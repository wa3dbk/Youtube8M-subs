00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 Of course, we were able to join the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.220
 bavaria here in 41 41 small differences 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 mooring in the lineup for the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 Plan can be played right here again 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.770
 on the one hand and martin it here in the center 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 the one reason for sure that you 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.950
 here in the center in london 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.720
 Of course, maybe something else 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.860
 stronger fighting when it is against the 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.809
 first pressure from you better 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 can hold against it also by the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.660
 also headball when I am 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
 forechecking game just come for a long time 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 balls around the first headballs too 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.840
 win away from the goal 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 and number two, I think that one over 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 the right side over casola in the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 defensive movement maybe not quite 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.219
 so good is here about philipp lame 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.739
 to exercise a great deal of pressure in an offensive 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 but can also be very offensive 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.219
 fast is the next of philipp lame 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 maybe better defended 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.820
 as rafinha was for plan then maybe 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 but still a bit faster 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.489
 then let's have a look what 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 the ten minutes has happened 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.399
 of course a lot of power tasted 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.289
 and of course with that 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.950
 faded elfmeter is the psyche 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.420
 of course a bit too 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
 went down so that you have seen 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.220
 that it is not always deeper behind 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.259
 you are pure and you just are not 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 do not organize more aggressive 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 just distributed in front but just 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.170
 passive back defends the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.110
 Of course, Bavaria has moved on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.939
 very obvious with the bavaria 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.380
 that the full backs are completely wide 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.909
 that means in the first ten 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.130
 minutes you did not have the chance 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.570
 to perform the position changes the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 Changes to the game structure 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.080
 playing system fc bavaria with us on the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 Youtube-channel already discussed 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.710
 that could not have been implemented 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.390
 be nerdy in the super under pressure 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.650
 has set then disappears 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 of course always the power of the psyche 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.880
 relax and then bayern comes in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 you play in and you see that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.659
 then here they really start theirs 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.549
 players to change the game structure 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.470
 that the teeth are here again and again against 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 the different movement here in 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.430
 the gaps here purely offer this here 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.710
 get ball around here with one 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.509
 vacancies are relatively central here in 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.130
 also relocate games 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.840
 and that's the way to go 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.579
 he happens that the toni kroos himself 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.110
 here here if you look at the chains 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.090
 here looks from the center here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 pulls out of his tens position 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.989
 pull out here gets the ball in one 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.579
 open position and then what we 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.140
 has often seen that the robben then 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.420
 starts to run through here in a tempo 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.610
 then the long ball comes in here 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 Zentrum Rhein this all just results 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.460
 out of ten here from the different 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.140
 move here 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.000
 to open and to open 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.170
 then somebody is toni kroos again 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.880
 playing great balls can be great as well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.020
 game is brutally dangerous 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.400
 no longer exercise the pressure 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.170
 then comes the long ball here on the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.470
 crawl in and then of course the red 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.850
 the map of course after the rule, too 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.070
 But the whole game is justified 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.080
 of course that means having assen 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.090
 then just have to take out one here 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.100
 not but it was summer they had there 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.520
 pulled back and then has just 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.530
 defended in a 441 and then it will 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.120
 of course harder and harder 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.040
 then I almost go to the front 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.960
 no relief and then 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.660
 these start in bavaria machinery 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.520
 that what you saw is that 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.620
 the pep guardiola also immediately then 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.330
 has responded to the second half and has 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 then right here the rafinha 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.140
 brought in and has the martinez 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.130
 taken out for even more playing power 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.570
 to contribute here 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.520
 also in matisse not excluded so 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.190
 back in boateng then already 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.510
 So yellow was loaded on the one hand here 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.980
 to take a risk that we too 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.840
 the red ones get the yellow red card 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.670
 martin is pulled back rafinha 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 brought in and rafinha me inside 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.230
 pulled in and then started now 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 just with the full-backs 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.820
 pulled in somehow to play 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.230
 -back of the two six- 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.360
 full back and now the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.830
 wingplayer has been seen the same 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.510
 he immediately refines himself to the center 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.070
 this could also orient 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.710
 Check youtube channel again 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.320
 with us spielsystem the bayern so that 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.330
 changed immediately and here from the 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.650
 center out where we already played 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.080
 have said that one here the 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.370
 foursome chain in the center close ties because 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.990
 the full back not just outside 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.970
 already im standing and i mean mine now 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.710
 wing players who come here shorter 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.310
 here again in open position 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.230
 bring 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.120
 and now either the alabas and one 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.550
 second has seen extremely just here 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.540
 running in front of the front here is running around the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.010
 to get ball 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.290
 the opponent of course to part 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.790
 must follow and then the ten here 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.109
 example has come out and here 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.060
 to exert pressure again 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.590
 then he starts was of course the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.540
 Change of position then you have completely 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.090
 Often the godfather and that looks 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.590
 Robben both were on one side then 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.910
 is the backtracking of philipp lame 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.160
 even from the center then again 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.900
 out and from the wing that the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.340
 pressure is getting bigger and bigger and 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.520
 then, of course, the bavaria is hardly too 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.520
 beat
