00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.949
 these are the new balance boards bryan 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.080
 from tetra are suitable for everyone 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.000
 External outdoor filter and we provide 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.220
 a surface for nitrate reductions 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.960
 Bacteria thereby become permanent 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.579
 optimal water values ​​in the aquarium 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.010
 what created the handling of the 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.489
 aquarium extremely simplified I can 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.350
 let's see how the world look like this 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.940
 white spots made of a special 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.620
 be made more 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.449
 bid by the form that the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 surface is going on or in stepped 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.710
 dismantling with their good settle on it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.539
 can and the polymer at the same time 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.789
 as nutrient sources for these papers 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.710
 the balance boards will be out in the field 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.870
 filled as far as possible that is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.120
 close in the outflow opening in this 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.059
 fall so it's the chief here corp 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.920
 I'll take that out remove that 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.500
 two tile in here are further 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.050
 and he put these samples flowing here 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.250
 then through the world of sports as 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.500
 Fist formula for the new facility 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 one falls outside that is one leg per 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.250
 2 liter aquarium 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.750
 the basket is then returned to the filter 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.209
 used and the balls should be with 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.770
 a fleece are covered with it 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.959
 removal of the balls resulting small 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.890
 particles are not in the motor of the filter 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.890
 get stuck 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.049
 another advantage of the balance board 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.659
 is that during the microbiological 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.700
 The depletion carbonate is formed 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.070
 thus the hair is worth in one 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.259
 optimal range stabilizes nitrate 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.899
 is an important nutrient plant and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.250
 unfortunately also for algae in the aquarium 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.159
 Feeding and metabolism of the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.649
 fish gets nitrate into the water is too 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 A lot of nitrate in the aquarium can not do it all 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.450
 taken up by aquatic plants 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.640
 become 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 the health surplus leads to 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.150
 unbalanced water is the value 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.430
 Change of water required 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.440
 with the help of the idrizi round 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.319
 Bacteria will increase in the nitrate 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 aquarium first prevented and after 12 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.700
 the nitrate concentration decreases for weeks 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.959
 even from there are thus through the use 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.910
 the balance boards less 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.340
 excess nutrients in the aquarium 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.989
 available 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 the balance gold will make you last longer 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.010
 optimal water values ​​thus the number 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.010
 the water change is minimized 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.319
 fish and plants are enjoying the best 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.319
 health
