00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
with it and i decided here I'm thinking
he's<00:01:38.610> probably<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:39.000> switch<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
he's probably gonna switch because it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.270 
he's probably gonna switch because it
usually<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
usually it would do that much to a

now this is a lead seating breloom so it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.200
