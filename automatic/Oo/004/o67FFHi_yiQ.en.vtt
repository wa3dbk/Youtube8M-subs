the outside layer so once it's rinse you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.370 
the outside layer so once it's rinse you
can<00:02:57.800> go<00:02:57.890> ahead<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.130> throw<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.430> in

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.030 

it<00:03:04.100> definitely<00:03:04.940> gives<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.050> energy<00:03:06.230> sometimes

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040

enzymes and nutrients try and drink it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.920 
enzymes and nutrients try and drink it
within<00:03:24.520> 20<00:03:25.520> minutes<00:03:25.610> after<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.450> juice<00:03:26.720> it
