 play games to make simonov 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.800
 two boxes to see enter quesnel them 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.699
 What images or anything they find 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 there we saw better tech at the showcase with 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.050
 retro games we classify all the games 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.909
 retro games gaming all the old games 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.809
 who may be ten years old people 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.900
 like to play it that reminds me of a 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.210
 little children is the reading plan 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.309
 for all a small lounge to come and read 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 quietly manga 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 comfortably seated and far away from 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 noises of video games one can also 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.380
 having fun with friends to discuss what 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.820
 it very user friendly it saddens me to sion 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.619
 to be safe from the rays 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.619
 if you want to isolate yourself a little bit 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 open more 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.670
 a second luminous scene we do not know 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 not answer echoing a little different 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.940
 but it's a principle kuate consoles 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.550
 ps3 and xbox am so this total defect 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.280
 six console points to play 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.730
 quietly everything is our friend 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.730
 it's pretty 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.189
 here is the service of too close the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.749
 two arcade bollards an arcade bollard 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.979
 who fall are ps2 or I'm for 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:03.020
 joy of the players and roland pacman 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.329
 special my wrongs all that a band that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.819
 turns on xbox in October challenge 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.399
 fight street fighter or such fight 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.230
 marvel versus capcom this is the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.330
 retro consoles so we saw the days we 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.030
 can play these games here so if he 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.379
 is the screen that goes with inevitably too 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.690
 we seemed too much on a big screen 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.090
 is not ugly enough 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.080
 so here at psg would have proposed here 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.319
 on the good old consoles like 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.690
 the nes the super year 64 gamecube the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:35.079
 megadrive the ps1 and ps2 they will finish 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.079
 as to contain it 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.090
 to finish the dance game we know 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.650
 what's called this way it's a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.780
 rhythm game we do we do not pose on 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.660
 the arrows to scroll the screen 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.620
 and when the arrow arrives on the ba must 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.120
 search will always be exposing 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.310
 keep the rhythm and dance 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.349
 this is the new dressing a screen in 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 the world that comes is free from agreement 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.310
 very good thank you
