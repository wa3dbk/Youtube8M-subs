karate<00:01:57.890> before

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
karate before

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:20.670 
karate before
yeah

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.870 

you're<00:02:21.680> doing<00:02:21.950> some<00:02:22.100> cool<00:02:22.280> stuff<00:02:22.520> where<00:02:22.730> you

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you're doing some cool stuff where you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.699 
you're doing some cool stuff where you
were<00:02:23.000> moving<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.870> were<00:02:23.990> moving<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.319> eyeballs

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
were moving you were moving the eyeballs

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.150 
were moving you were moving the eyeballs
individually<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:25.700> those<00:02:25.910> stops<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:27.160> realize

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
individually on those stops I realize

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.199 
individually on those stops I realize
that<00:02:28.190> might<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.090> nice<00:02:29.590> okay

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
that might be a nice okay

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.980 
that might be a nice okay
demonstration<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.300> how<00:02:32.450> much<00:02:32.630> control<00:02:32.959> you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
demonstration of how much control you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.320 
demonstration of how much control you
have<00:02:33.290> over<00:02:33.319> there<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.160> see<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.150> close

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
have over there I see if I can get close

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.610 
have over there I see if I can get close
to<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.569> after<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.840> smell<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.530> actually

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
to the after that smell is actually

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.530 
to the after that smell is actually
that's<00:02:39.620> gonna<00:02:39.800> be<00:02:39.950> cool<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.670> wish<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.330> slowed

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
down I can change yeah so so we we've

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.540 
down I can change yeah so so we we've
done<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.970> head<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.959> top<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.350> head<00:03:09.550> it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
done the head the top of the head it's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.610 
done the head the top of the head it's
in<00:03:10.730> more<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:12.170> points<00:03:12.440> are<00:03:12.530> now

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
in more I see the points are now

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.350 
in more I see the points are now
sticking<00:03:12.920> not<00:03:13.400> jittering<00:03:13.940> all<00:03:14.120> over<00:03:14.269> the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
sticking not jittering all over the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.160 
sticking not jittering all over the
place<00:03:14.540> tomorrow<00:03:14.780> man<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.239> first<00:03:20.570> breath

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
place tomorrow man so that first breath

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.310 
place tomorrow man so that first breath
maybe<00:03:21.440> pull<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.330> further<00:03:24.019> back<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
maybe pull the the a further back so

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.259 
maybe pull the the a further back so
that<00:03:24.739> she<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.040> has<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> bit<00:03:25.489> more<00:03:25.519> movement<00:03:26.120> on

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
that she just has a bit more movement on

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:37.840 
that she just has a bit more movement on
that<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.709> also<00:03:36.860> gone<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.280> little<00:03:37.519> bit<00:03:37.640> looser

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
that so it also gone a little bit looser

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.210 
that so it also gone a little bit looser
on<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.450> material<00:03:38.870> on<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.620> top<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.040> it

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
on the material on the top so that it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.570 
on the material on the top so that it
follows

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
follows

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.470 

okay<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.760> first<00:03:46.940> time<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.239> that's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
okay is that the first time that that's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.660 
okay is that the first time that that's
happened<00:03:47.950> that's<00:03:48.950> what<00:03:49.190> it's<00:03:49.310> supposed<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.610> be

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
happened that's what it's supposed to be

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.640 
happened that's what it's supposed to be
like<00:03:49.910> when<00:03:50.060> she<00:03:50.239> says<00:03:50.510> we'll<00:03:51.140> see<00:03:51.410> with

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
like when she says we'll see with

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.290 
like when she says we'll see with
whether<00:03:51.980> she<00:03:52.220> goes<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.489> play<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.819> drum<00:03:53.030> trail

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
whether she goes to play the drum trail

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.830 
whether she goes to play the drum trail
or<00:03:53.480> talk<00:03:53.660> more<00:03:54.020> yards<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.730> they<00:03:55.910> look<00:03:56.450> at<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
or talk more yards but they look at the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:10.000 
or talk more yards but they look at the
airplane<00:04:07.060> even<00:04:08.060> if<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:09.080> end<00:04:09.319> shape<00:04:09.620> ends<00:04:09.920> up

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
airplane even if the end shape ends up

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.180 
airplane even if the end shape ends up
slightly<00:04:10.340> smaller<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.180> think<00:04:11.390> that's<00:04:11.569> bad

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
slightly smaller and I think that's bad

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.800 
slightly smaller and I think that's bad
it's<00:04:13.190> like<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.880> emotions<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.720> then

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
it's like that the emotions and then

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.300 
it's like that the emotions and then
memories<00:04:15.290> yeah

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
memories yeah

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.759 
memories yeah

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
or something that we're giving it a

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.550 
or something that we're giving it a
shape<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.209> color<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.169> we<00:04:21.290> haven't

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
shape to and a color to that we haven't

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.510 
shape to and a color to that we haven't
seen<00:04:22.040> before
