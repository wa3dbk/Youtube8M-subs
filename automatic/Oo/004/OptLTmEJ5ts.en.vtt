while<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> quick<00:01:03.239> scan<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
while we just do a quick scan of the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
while we just do a quick scan of the
environment<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.540> yeah<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.990> hit

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
environment there and yeah just hit

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.550 
environment there and yeah just hit
loading<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.979> problem<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.470> some

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
loading the problem is this for some

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.539 
loading the problem is this for some
reason<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:13.500> quite<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> slow<00:01:14.040> loading<00:01:14.280> mad<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
reason it is quite a slow loading mad I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
reason it is quite a slow loading mad I
presume<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> entities

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
presume it's because of all the entities

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760 
presume it's because of all the entities
that<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.530> around<00:01:16.890> constantly<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.470> each<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that are around constantly and each so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
that are around constantly and each so
you<00:01:19.830> might<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.400> some<00:01:20.610> difficulties<00:01:21.150> playing

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you might have some difficulties playing

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.410 
you might have some difficulties playing
this<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.110> wear<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> bad<00:01:25.020> pc

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
this if you wear if you have a bad pc

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
this if you wear if you have a bad pc

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
well as you can say it's pretty killed

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.219

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:44.749 

yeah<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.390> error<00:01:39.390> air<00:01:42.799> but<00:01:43.799> i<00:01:44.189> think

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
bugs but i guess these guys are working

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.270 
bugs but i guess these guys are working
on<00:01:49.470> these<00:01:49.860> trees<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.490> epic<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:52.130> really<00:01:53.130> like

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
on these trees look epic i really like

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
on these trees look epic i really like
this<00:01:53.810> there's<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:54.960> cool

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this there's some cool

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.730 
this there's some cool
addictions<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:57.729> sure<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.140> under<00:01:59.380> some<00:01:59.560> water

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
addictions for sure and under some water

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.599 
addictions for sure and under some water
ones<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.520> know<00:02:00.579> could<00:02:00.850> maybe<00:02:01.030> use<00:02:01.270> work

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
ones that you know could maybe use work

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.950 
ones that you know could maybe use work
but<00:02:03.609> all<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.880> all<00:02:03.969> I<00:02:04.030> think<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.420> has<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.600> lot<00:02:04.750> of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
but all in all I think it has a lot of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.469 
but all in all I think it has a lot of
potential<00:02:05.319> it's<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.829> really<00:02:06.009> really<00:02:06.399> cool<00:02:06.520> not

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.000 

the<00:02:10.479> only<00:02:10.569> downsides<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.290> would<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.769> far

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the only downsides I would have so far

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.170 
the only downsides I would have so far
are<00:02:13.260> some<00:02:14.260> some<00:02:15.069> framedrops<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
are some some framedrops and then the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.900 
are some some framedrops and then the
other<00:02:19.209> problem<00:02:19.780> i<00:02:19.900> will<00:02:19.959> have<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.910> just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
other problem i will have is a just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.490 
other problem i will have is a just
similar<00:02:22.060> generation<00:02:22.780> seems<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.110> little<00:02:23.290> bit

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
similar generation seems a little bit

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.050 
similar generation seems a little bit
