00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
the during the way I think yes there's a

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.269 
the during the way I think yes there's a
chance<00:04:56.469> they<00:04:56.619> could<00:04:56.679> get<00:04:56.889> rid<00:04:57.039> of<00:04:57.099> him<00:04:57.189> I

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:07.469 
scenario well we said this Panama team
was<00:05:05.919> potentially<00:05:06.429> a<00:05:06.489> contender<00:05:07.089> coming<00:05:07.359> into

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
was potentially a contender coming into

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.479 
was potentially a contender coming into
this<00:05:07.569> tournament<00:05:07.839> a<00:05:08.139> huge<00:05:08.619> win<00:05:08.889> in<00:05:09.219> game<00:05:09.459> one

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:09.489 
this tournament a huge win in game one

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:11.969 
this tournament a huge win in game one
Simon<00:05:10.089> are<00:05:10.419> they<00:05:10.749> competing<00:05:11.259> with<00:05:11.529> the<00:05:11.619> US<00:05:11.829> and

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
Simon are they competing with the US and

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.619 
Simon are they competing with the US and
Mexico<00:05:12.339> for<00:05:12.489> the<00:05:12.579> championship<00:05:12.939> now<00:05:13.179> I<00:05:13.359> think

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
Mexico for the championship now I think

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.959 
Mexico for the championship now I think
especially<00:05:13.959> if<00:05:14.469> Mexico<00:05:15.039> is<00:05:15.249> on<00:05:15.549> a<00:05:15.579> downward

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
especially if Mexico is on a downward

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.539 
especially if Mexico is on a downward
slide<00:05:16.569> in<00:05:16.929> this<00:05:17.259> tournament<00:05:17.559> they<00:05:18.129> can<00:05:18.369> maybe

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:18.549 
slide in this tournament they can maybe

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.549 
slide in this tournament they can maybe
have<00:05:18.819> some<00:05:19.149> hope<00:05:19.419> but<00:05:19.599> i<00:05:19.659> don't<00:05:20.199> think<00:05:20.319> that

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:20.559 
have some hope but i don't think that

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.989 
have some hope but i don't think that
other<00:05:20.829> teams<00:05:21.099> are<00:05:21.219> going<00:05:21.309> to<00:05:21.369> take<00:05:21.549> alberto

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:21.999 
other teams are going to take alberto

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.909 
other teams are going to take alberto
quintero<00:05:22.149> lightly<00:05:22.779> or<00:05:22.899> gabby<00:05:23.439> told<00:05:23.679> us<00:05:23.769> for

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
quintero lightly or gabby told us for

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.529 
quintero lightly or gabby told us for
that<00:05:24.099> matter<00:05:24.339> I<00:05:24.549> don't<00:05:24.879> think<00:05:24.939> cantera<00:05:25.389> will

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
that matter I don't think cantera will

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.569 
that matter I don't think cantera will
do<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.779> damage<00:05:26.019> he<00:05:26.289> did<00:05:26.319> against<00:05:26.679> Mexico<00:05:27.159> to

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:27.579 
do the damage he did against Mexico to

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:29.639 
do the damage he did against Mexico to
other<00:05:27.789> teams<00:05:28.179> so<00:05:28.629> I<00:05:28.869> think<00:05:29.019> they'll<00:05:29.409> get<00:05:29.619> out

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:29.649 
other teams so I think they'll get out

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:31.679 
other teams so I think they'll get out
of<00:05:29.859> the<00:05:29.949> group<00:05:30.129> they<00:05:30.489> might<00:05:30.729> finish<00:05:30.999> first<00:05:31.419> but

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 
of the group they might finish first but

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.209 
of the group they might finish first but
I<00:05:32.049> don't<00:05:32.409> know<00:05:32.589> necessarily<00:05:32.769> they<00:05:33.159> were

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
I don't know necessarily they were

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.619 
I don't know necessarily they were
contender<00:05:33.609> for<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:33.789> title<00:05:33.819> remember<00:05:34.479> this

the<00:06:26.229> field<00:06:26.439> but<00:06:26.799> they've<00:06:26.979> struggled<00:06:27.489> scoring

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
goals at key moments I think Roger Rojas

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.919 
goals at key moments I think Roger Rojas
is<00:06:29.979> a<00:06:30.129> good<00:06:30.579> commodity<00:06:31.239> and<00:06:31.389> then<00:06:31.719> Ronnie

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:31.929 
is a good commodity and then Ronnie

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.229 
is a good commodity and then Ronnie
Martinez<00:06:32.409> both<00:06:32.589> of<00:06:32.769> them<00:06:32.919> 12<00:06:33.879> are<00:06:33.939> the<00:06:33.999> top
