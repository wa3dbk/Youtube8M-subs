00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
from the last video the manifolds that

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.029 
from the last video the manifolds that
was<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> big<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.560> were<00:00:28.680> talking<00:00:28.980> about

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
was the big thing we were talking about

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.420 
was the big thing we were talking about
we<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> manifolds<00:00:30.420> clocked<00:00:31.219> angled<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
we got the manifolds clocked angled and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.010 
we got the manifolds clocked angled and
welded<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.600> they<00:00:33.660> turned<00:00:33.899> out

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
welded back on and they turned out

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.639 
welded back on and they turned out
pretty<00:00:34.140> good

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
pretty good

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
pretty good
lots<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> clearance<00:00:35.719> that's<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.020> did

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
lots of clearance that's what we did

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.720 
lots of clearance that's what we did
today<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.710> bolted<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> check

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
today we just bolted them up to check

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.819 
today we just bolted them up to check
the<00:00:38.850> clearance<00:00:39.170> everything<00:00:40.170> looks<00:00:40.350> good<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the clearance everything looks good I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.080 
the clearance everything looks good I
get<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> better<00:00:42.000> shot

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.060 

check<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.900> other<00:00:48.050> side

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.030 

think<00:00:53.070> Knicks<00:00:53.250> pay<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:54.290> DHT<00:00:55.290> high-temp

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
think Knicks pay some DHT high-temp

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.530 
think Knicks pay some DHT high-temp
paint<00:00:57.290> yeah<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.469> harness<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.860> be<00:00:58.980> moved

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.030 

EGR<00:01:03.540> valve<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.140> cut<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> welded

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
EGR valve we just cut it off and welded

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.820 
EGR valve we just cut it off and welded
it<00:01:05.129> shut<00:01:06.140> same<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.470> side<00:01:07.530> though

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it shut same thing on this side though

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.790 
it shut same thing on this side though
the<00:01:07.860> flange<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.520> clocked<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.800> it

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
the flange is just clocked to where it

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.920 
the flange is just clocked to where it
would<00:01:10.950> clear<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> frame<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.450> angled<00:01:12.780> in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
would clear the frame and then angled in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:35.969 
would clear the frame and then angled in
and<00:01:13.650> weld<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.009> on<00:01:14.630> regular<00:01:15.630> MIG<00:01:15.930> welder

the notch in the top of it but these

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.880 
the notch in the top of it but these
mounts<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:59.080> had<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.259> install<00:01:59.500> these<00:01:59.619> today

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
mounts we had to install these today

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.010 
mounts we had to install these today
they're<00:02:00.130> motor<00:02:00.610> mount<00:02:00.790> adapter<00:02:00.880> plates<00:02:01.360> they

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
they're motor mount adapter plates they

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.710 
they're motor mount adapter plates they
set<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.409> engine<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.759> inch<00:02:03.970> further<00:02:04.390> back

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
set the engine one inch further back

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.469 
set the engine one inch further back
than<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> previous<00:02:05.440> plates<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.369> had<00:02:06.580> we

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
than the previous plates that we had we

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.820 
than the previous plates that we had we
didn't<00:02:07.630> realize<00:02:07.899> those<00:02:08.110> central<00:02:08.500> mounting

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
didn't realize those central mounting

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.070 
didn't realize those central mounting
plates<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.250> were<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.459> before<00:02:09.929> left<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
plates that were on before left the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
plates that were on before left the
engine<00:02:11.200> an<00:02:11.410> inch<00:02:11.620> too<00:02:12.040> far<00:02:12.250> forward<00:02:12.550> engine

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
engine an inch too far forward engine

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 
engine an inch too far forward engine
and<00:02:13.090> transmission<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.140> drive<00:02:14.590> shaft

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
and transmission so the drive shaft

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
and transmission so the drive shaft
stuck<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> transmission<00:02:16.330> an<00:02:16.420> inch

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
stuck out of the transmission an inch

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.370 
stuck out of the transmission an inch
too<00:02:16.810> far<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:19.239> today<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.630> lifted<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.170> side

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
too far but today we lifted up one side

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.020 
too far but today we lifted up one side
at<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> time<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.070> easiest<00:02:21.340> way<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.489> found<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.850> do

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
at a time the easiest way I found to do

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.140 
at a time the easiest way I found to do
that<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:23.890> put<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> cherry<00:02:24.519> picker<00:02:24.700> put<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
that is we put the cherry picker put a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210 
that is we put the cherry picker put a
chain<00:02:25.360> on<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.540> side<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.989> engine<00:02:26.140> took<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
chain on one side of the engine took the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.570 
chain on one side of the engine took the
bolt<00:02:27.400> out<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.760> side<00:02:28.230> pulled<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
bolt out of this side pulled up this

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.680 
bolt out of this side pulled up this
side<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:30.940> engine<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.330> way<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.630> could

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
side of the engine so that way we could

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.660 
side of the engine so that way we could
get<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.930> there<00:02:31.959> take<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> clamshell<00:02:32.530> off<00:02:32.980> take

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
get in there take the clamshell off take

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.860 
get in there take the clamshell off take
the<00:02:33.760> plate<00:02:33.940> off<00:02:33.970> put<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> new<00:02:34.420> one<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.780> set

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the plate off put a new one on and set

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.170 
the plate off put a new one on and set
it<00:02:34.959> down<00:02:34.989> vice<00:02:35.890> versa<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.790> put<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> bolt

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it down vice versa when we put the bolt

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.210 
it down vice versa when we put the bolt
back<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.410> other<00:02:38.590> side<00:02:40.980> put<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> bolt

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
back in go to the other side put a bolt

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.100 
back in go to the other side put a bolt
on<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.489> outer<00:02:42.610> side<00:02:42.850> pick<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> up<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.019> we<00:02:44.079> just

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
on the outer side pick it up so we just

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.259 
on the outer side pick it up so we just
Rock<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.470> engine<00:02:44.890> over<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.820> change<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
Rock the engine over and change out the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.750 
Rock the engine over and change out the
plate<00:02:46.769> got<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.890> engine<00:02:48.130> moved<00:02:48.280> back<00:02:48.459> an<00:02:48.610> inch

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
plate got the engine moved back an inch

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.590 
plate got the engine moved back an inch
now<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.570> drive<00:02:50.110> shaft<00:02:50.350> looks<00:02:50.590> good<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.540> can

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
now the drive shaft looks good you can

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.990 
now the drive shaft looks good you can
see<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.010> about<00:02:54.220> perfect<00:02:54.610> distance<00:02:54.880> as

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
see but it's about perfect distance as

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.440 
see but it's about perfect distance as
it<00:02:55.120> should<00:02:55.269> be<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.239> aimes

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it should be now now that it's aimes

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.330 
it should be now now that it's aimes
back<00:02:59.100> for<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> crossmember<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:01.780> had<00:03:02.100> moved<00:03:03.100> it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
back for the crossmember we had moved it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460 
back for the crossmember we had moved it
back<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.690> see<00:03:04.870> right<00:03:05.019> here<00:03:05.200> I'll<00:03:05.320> show<00:03:05.440> you

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
back so you see right here I'll show you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.970 
back so you see right here I'll show you
a<00:03:05.590> picture<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.070> here<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.940> had<00:03:10.829> cut<00:03:11.829> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
a picture of it here but we had cut it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.410 
a picture of it here but we had cut it
slid<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.549> back<00:03:12.579> in<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.030> welded<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.299> back

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
slid it back in and welded it back

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.220 
slid it back in and welded it back
together<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.840> both<00:03:13.959> sides<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.519> can<00:03:15.519> see<00:03:15.670> there

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
together on both sides you can see there

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.590 
together on both sides you can see there
so<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:18.070> had<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.430> bit<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.640> room<00:03:18.790> still<00:03:18.940> in

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
so it had a little bit of room still in

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.120 
so it had a little bit of room still in
the<00:03:19.810> slot<00:03:20.049> here<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.500> now<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.890> we've<00:03:21.010> moved

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the slot here but now that we've moved

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.930 
the slot here but now that we've moved
the<00:03:21.280> engine<00:03:21.579> back<00:03:22.350> an<00:03:23.350> inch<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:24.400> maxed<00:03:24.790> out

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the engine back an inch it's maxed out

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.000 
the engine back an inch it's maxed out
so<00:03:25.180> we've<00:03:25.299> got<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.510> wall<00:03:25.660> off<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.989> hole<00:03:26.170> give

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
so we've got the wall off that hole give

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.350 
so we've got the wall off that hole give
it<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.220> little<00:03:27.400> slack<00:03:27.610> there<00:03:27.910> we're<00:03:28.090> putting

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
it a little slack there we're putting

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.580 
it a little slack there we're putting
some<00:03:28.450> pressure<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.900> trans<00:03:29.230> mount<00:03:29.410> right

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
some pressure on that trans mount right

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
some pressure on that trans mount right
now

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
now

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.610 
now

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
also today the other big thing that we

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.099 
also today the other big thing that we
accomplished<00:03:33.070> was<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> Ellis<00:03:33.640> -<00:03:33.820> cam<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.930> got

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
accomplished was the Ellis - cam we got

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.990 
accomplished was the Ellis - cam we got
it<00:03:35.230> nailed<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.100> -<00:03:36.280> cam<00:03:36.489> slipped<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
it nailed this - cam slipped in the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.360 
it nailed this - cam slipped in the

front LS - covers on there right now but

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.250 
front LS - covers on there right now but
he's<00:03:39.519> gonna<00:03:39.640> pull<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:39.940> back<00:03:40.060> off<00:03:40.209> clean<00:03:41.079> it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
he's gonna pull it back off clean it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.070 
he's gonna pull it back off clean it
paint<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.910> notice<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.329> cam<00:03:43.660> sensors<00:03:43.989> in

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
paint it you notice the cam sensors in

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.890 
paint it you notice the cam sensors in
the<00:03:44.170> front<00:03:44.260> now<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> LS<00:03:45.580> 2<00:03:45.790> cam<00:03:46.599> gears

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
since the LS - cam doesn't have the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.290 
since the LS - cam doesn't have the
reluctor<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.879> back<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.120> the
