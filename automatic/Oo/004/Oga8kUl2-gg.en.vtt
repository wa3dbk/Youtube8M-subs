together<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.299> look<00:02:31.450> totally

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
together to make a look totally

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.839 
together to make a look totally
realistic<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.950> create<00:02:33.220> environment<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
realistic to create environment it

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:49.910 
realistic to create environment it
actually<00:02:34.180> didn't<00:02:34.420> exist

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.650 

we<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.069> now<00:02:51.220> completed<00:02:51.520> our<00:02:51.910> second<00:02:52.330> shot<00:02:52.510> of

we have now completed our second shot of
the<00:02:52.720> day<00:02:52.900> which<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.680> vehicle<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.459> front<00:02:54.490> of

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the day which is the vehicle in front of

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.240 
the day which is the vehicle in front of
the<00:02:55.480> hotel<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:56.380> one<00:02:56.620> actually<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:57.160> very

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
the hotel this one actually is very

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.570 
the hotel this one actually is very
complicated<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:58.740> what<00:02:59.740> we've<00:02:59.920> done<00:03:00.160> is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
complicated because what we've done is

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.780 
complicated because what we've done is
we've<00:03:01.000> selected<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:02.020> location<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.800> we've<00:03:03.580> had

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
we've selected a location and we've had

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.630 
we've selected a location and we've had
Roger<00:03:04.300> lit<00:03:04.840> right<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.560> left<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.520> our

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
Roger lit right to left and with our

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.850 
Roger lit right to left and with our
location<00:03:07.209> son<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.320> on<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.560> opposite

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
location son is on the opposite

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.330 
location son is on the opposite
direction<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.280> we've<00:03:09.580> flopped<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.630> image<00:03:10.930> and
