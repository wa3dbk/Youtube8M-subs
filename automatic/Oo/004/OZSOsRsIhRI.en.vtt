tour<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:47.190> called<00:00:47.489> surface<00:00:47.940> computing<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
tour it's called surface computing and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
tour it's called surface computing and
you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.500> without<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.039> interface<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.570> object<00:00:51.930> recognition<00:00:53.960> how<00:00:54.960> about

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
when it comes time to pay just lay down

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
when it comes time to pay just lay down
your<00:01:05.159> credit<00:01:05.610> card<00:01:05.880> divvy<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> bill<00:01:06.630> add

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
your credit card divvy up the bill add

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.490 
your credit card divvy up the bill add
in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> tip<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> lead<00:01:08.810> under<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> screen<00:01:10.260> our

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
in the tip and lead under the screen our

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
in the tip and lead under the screen our
cameras<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.310> actually<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:12.000> what

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.390> touching<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> computer

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:13.979> creating<00:01:14.670> an<00:01:14.790> image<00:01:15.170> there<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> go

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
reacts creating an image there you go

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
reacts creating an image there you go
and<00:01:17.040> again<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and again we just put it down here and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
and again we just put it down here and
it<00:01:19.049> spills<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.409> photos<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> prompt<00:01:20.820> see

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it spills out photos not a prompt see

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
it spills out photos not a prompt see
it's<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.869> magically<00:01:22.439> drawn<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's like they're magically drawn out of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.969 
it's like they're magically drawn out of
your<00:01:23.189> digital<00:01:23.400> camera<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> box

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
your digital camera into the box

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
your digital camera into the box
wirelessly<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> course<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.240> grab

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab
photos<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.290> grab<00:01:28.500> photos<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.280> pick

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
photos and I grab photos and we can pick

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
photos and I grab photos and we can pick
bigger<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.470> white<00:01:31.710> table<00:01:32.159> in

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
bigger so it's all our white table in

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
bigger so it's all our white table in
this<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.390> case<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this case in this case it is and so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109 
this case in this case it is and so
we've<00:01:34.500> used<00:01:34.770> those<00:01:35.070> different<00:01:35.430> attributes<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
we've used those different attributes of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
we've used those different attributes of
surface<00:01:36.570> computing<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.860> application<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
surface computing in this application to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.980 
surface computing in this application to
create<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> totally<00:01:39.390> different<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
create a totally different kind of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
create a totally different kind of
experience<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.890> you've<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.159> video<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> want

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
experience if you've got video you want

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.990 
experience if you've got video you want
running<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.610> play<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> video

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
running you can actually play the video

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
running you can actually play the video
the<00:01:45.840> first<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.439> units<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.100> into

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the first of these units will go into

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
the first of these units will go into
