00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.170
 hello I am from terminals of 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.150
 terminal photography this is our 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.550
 second episode of the series on how 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.660
 remote trigger for external flash 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.610
 in the first episode we saw 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.930
 how we could use our 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.250
 embedded flash that is on the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.770
 most DSLR cameras 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.239
 dslr if you have not seen this episode 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.129
 I urge you to do so because 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.120
 I covered several notions that do not 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.949
 are not going to be repeated today 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.420
 so today I was talking to you about a 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.739
 another way to trigger your flash 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.390
 external one used a command to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.760
 infrared that's what I have in my 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 this is the model of io io st 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.049
 e 2 it is almost identical to the version 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.190
 calibrate and share the same reference 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:53.629
 pe of the audio version came out after 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.239
 the calonne version and they have 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.790
 improved three tricks such as 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.489
 used batteries the cd doubles to and then 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.019
 they say that the infrared ray is 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 more powerful on the model than the 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.240
 model from canal + found 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.409
 also a model for at nikon and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.869
 I like to believe that you have the same 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.430
 thing at pentax and sony 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.470
 so is it neither more nor less 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.660
 that infrared infrared control 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.250
 sorry like that of your TV 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.500
 So here at the bank is what we have 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 in the panel for the infrared and here 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.680
 is below so it's a very good 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.790
 feature most of the time you 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.900
 will use defla in 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 environments that will not have much 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.910
 of ambient light and you can have 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.100
 hard to establish the focus is this 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.730
 part there will emit lights from 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.380
 red lines 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.180
 vertical and horizontal that will be 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.070
 reflected on your subject and you go 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.420
 able to establish your focus on these 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.360
 lines and so have a good grip 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.280
 so here is the back that is 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.600
 we have and you know a picture here 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.620
 which is displayed with the details we have 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.420
 some buttons but it's very easy 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.520
 in the end we have a button 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.390
 load the strings you see a 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.820
 two three four 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.490
 we have the ratio button with right or 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.200
 left and then we have a button on off 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 above the button with the hc what we 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.670
 call the famous rising speed flash 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.930
 it's for it's a mod for flashes 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.370
 we will not talk about it today I will do 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.050
 an episode very soon on this 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.879
 subject and then the little button with 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 the lightning in the bottom left is the button 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.120
 So test today to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.560
 other tests but what do we have the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 talent of 60 on a tripod 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.780
 we have the objective 50 mm 1.8 mark 2-2 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.600
 at channel and then we have two flashes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.970
 slaves who are both on the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.680
 chain 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.380
 1 so I'm going to pay attention to that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.510
 I'm on the flash the chain a pardon 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.370
 on my on my order 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.750
 and then our favorite model baby skype 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.880
 the ambient light here but it's like 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.350
 in our previous video we need 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.300
 of light so that you can 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.340
 see in the video but this light there 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.890
 was nothing in our exhibition 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.050
 I used the sync speed if 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.400
 you do not know what speed is 5 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.850
 roger david clicked on the link there that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.860
 appears 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.980
 I explain everything on this subject 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 so here in this case on this device 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.930
 I am at 1250th of a second 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 I am innocent and f8 if I take a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.240
 exposure now you see everything 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.320
 is black so there is no 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.180
 interference with ambient light 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 so now I'm going to plug the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 infrared command like that on the road 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.400
 secure game show and game there starts 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.370
 I take a catch what will happen 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.470
 is that the right light and the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 left light are going to be equal the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.220
 so here you see it's the same 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.390
 luminous force on the right and on the left 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.250
 now if I click the button 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.560
 ratio and well I can say that by 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.360
 example the right flash will be eight 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.110
 times more powerful than the flash of 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.019
 left you see this is the case and then 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.610
 very quickly go we go from the side 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.380
 the left flash 8 times more powerful 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.750
 that the right flash 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.310
 So here you have it is 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.930
 exactly the same features as 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.410
 when using the embedded flash eh 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.200
 good yes 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.630
 so why would we want to buy a 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.790
 additional equipment while 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.070
 our built-in flash does the same thing 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.560
 good for several reasons some 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.510
 wage apparatuses do not have 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.040
 embedded flash I think for example to 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.430
 professional devices I know that 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.850
 nikon to some devices with 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.920
 flashes 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.280
 but in canon that do not have the 5 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.870
 the 5d a mark 1 5d mark ii and 5d mark 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.940
 iii they do not have so 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.100
 and then the same for geese some of 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.290
 x and that's so they do not have you 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.800
 need a trigger of some sort 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.320
 that could be the case you mag 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.390
 aged girls heard about racing 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.280
 speed mode for flashes 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.500
 so it's the same way it's a mode 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.270
 you could not used 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.560
 with your embedded flash this this 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.060
 infrared control share the same 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.560
 somehow disadvantages that your 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.270
 built-in flash I think for example to 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400
 distance between your device and your 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.020
 flash then there is a little more 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.430
 powerful since it's infrared the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.560
 distance to the outside you can be 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.390
 a believer 25 30 meters so that's 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.040
 much more than putting your flash 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.390
 integrated if you are inside you 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.580
 will not have the problem since the radius 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.560
 infrared will bounce off the surfaces 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.420
 be careful though if you have any 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.120
 showcases or windows or doors 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.350
 glazed because the radius is likely to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.360
 lose but you need a 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.890
 certain line of sight somehow 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.720
 and what's good is that with this 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.490
 order there if your flash is located 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.160
 behind your device you have the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.500
 possibility to rotate to be a little 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.480
 more in the right direction so here is 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.370
 it's pretty much all you need 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.930
 know about it too to our advantage 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.910
 it's that you saw it in the other 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.290
 video when I was using the built-in flash 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.669
 the ebit is forced to go into the menus 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.040
 to change all the ratios and all that 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.100
 there I could do it directly from 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.320
 from the back panel so that's when 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.270
 even a little more practical here it is 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.490
 all they had to have on this 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.960
 this infrared command in our 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.630
 next episode the last we go 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.979
 see the famous radio release 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.180
 and then waiting next time 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.710
 but it's tommy go that tells you if you 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.630
 like what you see well captured and 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.290
 maybe with an infrared command 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.290
 ciao
