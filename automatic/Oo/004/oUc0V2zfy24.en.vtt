00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.280
 today I want to show you something a little more 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 advanced 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.710
 always because of the dimension that is the block 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 you can not get to many times 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.920
 develop the work in this way 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.430
 and I wanted to show you in this instance 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.980
 how to start smoking a little to eliminate 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.260
 and start composing more so that they see 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.350
 It is been a little beyond 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.100
 that we saw so far this is just I'm 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.550
 working with oil with medium and with 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.370
 solvent cotton and this is cool me 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.699
 I started it a little while ago then I start 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.010
 to bite and start playing with the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.130
 painting that I still have fresh oil 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.280
 allows me to take more time and not go with 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.600
 so much hurry in the workshop we apply it already 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.339
 when nothing starts 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.060
 to understand a little this way of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.170
 work and it's easier for them to take 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.030
 principle we always start in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.060
 Acrylics that is faster 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.140
 and for the anxious ones this is better 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 Allow a little more time 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.460
 here it's good to start playing and you 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.570
 they begin to see that this has a neat 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.930
 noise here then it helps me to have these 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.090
 spaces that are more silenced in the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.150
 picture well then I try to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.620
 respect could have happened that the work 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 I was 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.890
 developed in the country's total or 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.890
 then come to these targets here as 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.400
 I have them and pay respect and I 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.400
 interest 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.330
 I want to show you this of losing the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.280
 afraid to mix with the same brush myself 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.729
 I'm walking around the table without 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 fears the colors have to be mixed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.020
 so that the time has good composition 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 remember that by not having a drawing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.259
 prior we only help with the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.959
 color with the palette has to be a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.180
 attractive palette to give us 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.549
 desire to advance 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.239
 I try to respect some drips that 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.239
 they can be 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.390
 good to keep moving forward in the box 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.730
 and I'm choosing, I'm always choosing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.730
 with which I stay and what I take 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.110
 not with tournament and nothing else where I 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.740
 I feel the need to involve a sector 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.740
 wider 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.700
 I even chop again in color and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.700
 then started to enter some acrylic 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.000
 all these techniques the techniques of 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.040
 acrylic oil what we saw 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.800
 in other asphalt painting programs 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.990
 all this we see also in the classes 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.090
 regular workshop in the case of gold 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.920
 and we see it with advanced people 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.950
 who have already made some other 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.730
 working day 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.730
 has not advanced 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.670
 but already have the experience in 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.540
 this way 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.540
 There, yes 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.629
 and well we see the seminars too 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.360
 and soon in capital 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.510
 and we are also in hills on the coast 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.890
 in the wide sea car so good 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.960
 you can see the page and go 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.510
 watching month to month where are we going 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.380
 in color the white helps to clean 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380
 quite 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.500
 if you do not read it, it's not running, it helped 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.500
 with some medium 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.700
 and I'm taking situations 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.490
 to lighten this fund 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.340
 Take your time for the cultures 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.470
 hold on do not be afraid to stretch the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.290
 brushstroke 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.420
 it's practical but try not to go so 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.180
 punctual try to be helped 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.220
 enough and notice that did not advance 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.160
 too much in the sector 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.360
 today also involving different 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.700
 parts of the box so that the box 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.260
 even advance 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.820
 just like any of the other 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.890
 techniques that we saw 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.690
 in the distance that I need it 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.690
 again apply color 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.710
 it's not like I always go in with paint 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.710
 white 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.690
 and I take the girls who are having 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.550
 my work if lines that I gave him with 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.790
 graphics with the rubber spatula as 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.400
 we saw in other blocks 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.540
 and the shots as structure of my painting 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.770
 those that serve me I take them and those that do not 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.770
 I take them out 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.999
 the important thing is that they get carried away by 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.270
 the box that commit to what 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.270
 They are doing 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.970
 stop thinking 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.100
 when they are going to finish it and good and a 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.560
 little will they get better 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.160
 good results I hope you serve them 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.160
 see you
