 for Philipp Lahm the two the two center-backs form Baumann in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.230
 to reduce my old Mac theme to a polished Manchester United 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.390
 under the cat 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 and FC Barcelona 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.870

 that makes it the best defender in the world 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.410

 unbelievably well interpreted and around 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 OK for me the team players heard worldwide 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.170
 on the right side around the splitter more novelty on the credit side up 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 the outside position Cristiano Ronaldo form the two striker in my 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.540
 Didier Drogba has a topic 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.870

 Messi

 Stephanus best player in the world 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 but the show with an anomaly against him playing in youth teams Tina 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.750
 National team 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.230
 but unfortunately always lost 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.500
 Percent at the most not there 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870
