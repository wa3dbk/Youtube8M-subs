coach and it's really nice and tight
here<00:01:25.310> we've<00:01:25.819> actually<00:01:25.969> pushed<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.659> the

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
here we've actually pushed out the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.770 
here we've actually pushed out the
rubber<00:01:27.950> seal<00:01:28.249> all<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.549> way<00:01:28.670> around<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.359> we

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
rubber seal all the way around so we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.910 
rubber seal all the way around so we
know<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.020> nice<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.380> tight<00:01:30.499> I'll<00:01:30.679> probably

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
know it's nice and tight I'll probably

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.739 
know it's nice and tight I'll probably
run<00:01:31.189> over<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.609> with<00:01:31.789> some<00:01:31.969> silicone<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.659> to

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
run over that with some silicone just to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.749 
run over that with some silicone just to
be<00:01:32.899> safe<00:01:33.109> and<00:01:33.409> make<00:01:34.069> sure<00:01:34.249> that<00:01:34.369> it's<00:01:34.549> nice<00:01:34.700> and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
be safe and make sure that it's nice and

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.749 
be safe and make sure that it's nice and
tight<00:01:35.060> when<00:01:35.929> it's<00:01:36.049> time<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.229> hook<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.710> our<00:01:36.979> unit

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
tight when it's time to hook up our unit

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.279 
tight when it's time to hook up our unit
it's<00:01:37.969> really<00:01:38.270> very<00:01:38.420> simple<00:01:38.869> what<00:01:38.960> we're<00:01:39.109> going

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
it's really very simple what we're going

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.249 
it's really very simple what we're going
to<00:01:39.350> do<00:01:39.499> is<00:01:39.679> pop<00:01:40.249> that<00:01:40.310> open<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:41.840> will<00:01:41.960> take<00:01:42.109> our

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
to do is pop that open we will take our

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.859 
to do is pop that open we will take our
plug<00:01:42.729> put<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:43.819> in<00:01:43.969> there<00:01:44.179> it<00:01:44.270> clicks<00:01:44.539> right<00:01:44.659> in

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
plug put it in there it clicks right in

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.690 
plug put it in there it clicks right in
place<00:01:45.109> with<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.439> two<00:01:45.619> side<00:01:45.859> locks<00:01:46.130> push<00:01:46.520> that

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
place with the two side locks push that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.219 
place with the two side locks push that
down<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.210> third<00:01:47.389> lock<00:01:47.600> you're<00:01:47.810> done<00:01:47.990> walk

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
down it's a third lock you're done walk

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
down it's a third lock you're done walk
away<00:01:48.499> it's<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> nice<00:01:49.549> watertight<00:01:49.939> seal<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.659> has

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
away it's a nice watertight seal it has

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.719 
away it's a nice watertight seal it has

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
a rubber gasket inside as I showed

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.929 
a rubber gasket inside as I showed
before<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.829> keeps<00:01:54.829> any<00:01:55.130> moisture<00:01:55.729> from

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939
