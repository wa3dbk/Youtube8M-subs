00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
topic just because this is much more of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.500 
topic just because this is much more of
a<00:00:17.010> problem<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.369> grafite<00:00:17.880> an<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> for

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
a problem for grafite an it is for

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.179 
a problem for grafite an it is for
street<00:00:18.750> art<00:00:18.930> street<00:00:19.320> art<00:00:19.470> tends<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> lot

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
street art street art tends to be a lot

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
street art street art tends to be a lot
more<00:00:20.220> accepting<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:21.029> women<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:21.810> graffiti

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
more accepting of women then graffiti

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540 
more accepting of women then graffiti
does<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.070> might<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.430> because

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
does and I think that might be because

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.580 
does and I think that might be because
street<00:00:24.300> art<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> lot<00:00:24.779> more<00:00:24.960> closely<00:00:25.260> related

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
street art is a lot more closely related

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.500 
street art is a lot more closely related
to<00:00:25.830> fine<00:00:26.220> art<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> fine<00:00:26.970> art<00:00:27.119> doesn't<00:00:27.390> really

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to fine art and fine art doesn't really

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.910 
to fine art and fine art doesn't really
hold<00:00:27.720> any<00:00:27.930> prejudice<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:28.890> least

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
hold any prejudice and we're at least

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
hold any prejudice and we're at least
not<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:29.609> prejudice<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.179> graffiti<00:00:30.630> does

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
not as much prejudice as graffiti does

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
not as much prejudice as graffiti does
so<00:00:31.230> although<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.890> everything<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.640> video

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
will be relevant to street art some of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
will be relevant to street art some of
it<00:00:35.399> will<00:00:35.670> apply<00:00:35.969> alright<00:00:36.600> now<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it will apply alright now with all that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
out the way

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
out the way
let's<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.210> women<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.840> treated

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
let's get right to it women are treated

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
let's get right to it women are treated
like<00:00:40.320> shit<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.800> graffiti<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.640> not

like shit in graffiti and they are not
treated<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.420> equals<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.559> simply<00:00:43.829> because

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
treated as equals this is simply because

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.740 
treated as equals this is simply because
they're<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.430> respected<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.149> graffiti<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
they're not respected in graffiti and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.319 
they're not respected in graffiti and
that's<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.410> sex<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.969> common

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that's because sex it's pretty common

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
that's because sex it's pretty common
knowledge<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.899> graffiti<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.530> predominantly

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
