gonna give you a quick tour of the stuff

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
gonna give you a quick tour of the stuff
that<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.529> figure<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:22.890> reading<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
that we can figure out from reading the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.099 
that we can figure out from reading the
manual<00:00:23.519> first<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.539> front<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> have

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
manual first of all on the front we have

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.500 
manual first of all on the front we have
the<00:00:25.250> on/off<00:00:26.250> power<00:00:26.490> switch<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:29.010> think

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
the on/off power switch this we think

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.870 
the on/off power switch this we think
well<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> switch<00:00:31.199> position<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> means<00:00:32.340> 45

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
well in this switch position it means 45

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
well in this switch position it means 45
watts<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> switch<00:00:33.960> position<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.649> 65

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
watts and that switch position it's 65

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
watts and that switch position it's 65
watts<00:00:35.550> we've<00:00:36.090> garnered<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
watts we've garnered that much from the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400 
watts we've garnered that much from the
manual<00:00:38.000> without<00:00:39.000> having<00:00:39.420> used<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> before<00:00:40.140> as

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
manual without having used it before as

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
manual without having used it before as
best<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.399> tell<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
best we can tell we think it's for the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
best we can tell we think it's for the
heating<00:00:44.489> element<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
heating element and that in this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
heating element and that in this
position<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.950> heating<00:00:47.160> element<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
position the heating element will get a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
position the heating element will get a
little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.090> warmer<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.829> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
little bit warmer and this one it's not

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.279 
little bit warmer and this one it's not
quite<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.579> hot<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.420> guess<00:00:51.809> we'll<00:00:51.989> find<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
quite as hot so I guess we'll find that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.189 
quite as hot so I guess we'll find that
out<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.770> second

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
reading the manual that's so that you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.620 
reading the manual that's so that you
can<00:01:45.810> tell<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:47.009> need<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> descale<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
can tell when you need to descale the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
can tell when you need to descale the

coffee pot when it's getting hard water

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
coffee pot when it's getting hard water
deposits<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.020> may<00:01:52.170> interfere<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
deposits and it may interfere with the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.620 
deposits and it may interfere with the
way<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> coffee<00:01:53.369> brews<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.000> now<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
way that the coffee brews so now that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
way that the coffee brews so now that
I've<00:01:54.780> taken<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> whole<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.409> apart<00:01:55.680> let's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
I've taken the whole thing apart let's
