spread<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> word<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:38.969> however<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
spread the word a little bit however I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.590 
spread the word a little bit however I
did<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> past<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> Aurora<00:00:42.120> 44

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
did that in the past with the Aurora 44

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
did that in the past with the Aurora 44
guys<00:00:42.809> when<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.649> comes<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> their<00:00:44.250> game<00:00:44.460> ashen<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
guys when it comes to their game ashen I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.979 
guys when it comes to their game ashen I
think<00:00:45.180> they're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.600> e3<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
think they're going to be at e3 this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
think they're going to be at e3 this
year<00:00:46.170> probably<00:00:46.620> behind<00:00:46.860> closed<00:00:47.219> doors<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.760> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
year probably behind closed doors so we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
year probably behind closed doors so we
probably<00:00:48.329> won't<00:00:48.510> hear<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.289> but

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
probably won't hear much about that but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.590 
probably won't hear much about that but
occasionally<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.579> cover<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> a

there<00:02:21.860> there's<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.250> know<00:02:22.370> different<00:02:22.580> guns

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
there there's you know different guns

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.720 
there there's you know different guns
different<00:02:23.450> cannons<00:02:24.350> drones<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.580> can

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
different cannons drones that you can

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
different cannons drones that you can
send<00:02:25.940> out<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.209> attack<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:27.050> what's<00:02:27.290> really

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
send out to attack but what's really

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.170 
send out to attack but what's really
interesting<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> fact<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.910> when<00:02:29.090> you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
interesting is the fact that when you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.940 
interesting is the fact that when you
get<00:02:29.330> too<00:02:29.420> close<00:02:29.540> together<00:02:29.959> sort<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.709> in<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
get too close together sort of in a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.850 
get too close together sort of in a
firefly<00:02:31.459> way<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.360> harpoon<00:02:32.630> one<00:02:33.560> another

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
firefly way you can harpoon one another

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.570 
firefly way you can harpoon one another
and<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.520> basically<00:02:35.060> docking<00:02:36.050> ring<00:02:36.080> up

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
and you can basically docking ring up

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.150 
and you can basically docking ring up
blow<00:02:37.580> their<00:02:37.790> docking<00:02:38.239> ring<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.720> battle<00:02:39.680> those

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
blow their docking ring and battle those

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.949 
blow their docking ring and battle those
people<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.880> their<00:02:41.090> ship<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.420> try<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.750> take

and you do battle one of the cool things
that<00:03:19.010> Ryan<00:03:19.310> was<00:03:19.459> explaining<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.120> there's<00:03:20.300> a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
that Ryan was explaining is there's a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.000 
that Ryan was explaining is there's a
particular<00:03:20.690> weapon<00:03:21.080> not<00:03:21.380> all<00:03:21.530> weapons<00:03:21.860> do

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
particular weapon not all weapons do

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.650 
particular weapon not all weapons do
this<00:03:22.190> there's<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.460> particular<00:03:22.760> weapon<00:03:23.150> that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
this there's a particular weapon that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.720 
this there's a particular weapon that
can<00:03:23.780> blow<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.290> windows<00:03:24.650> out<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.190> may

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
can blow the windows out of a may

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.270 
can blow the windows out of a may
ship<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.450> suck<00:03:26.840> people<00:03:27.230> through<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.769> out

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
ship and suck people through and out

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.100 
ship and suck people through and out
into<00:03:28.550> space<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.450> thought<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.750> was<00:03:29.870> really

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
into space and I thought that was really

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.559 
into space and I thought that was really
cool<00:03:30.230> because<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.310> core<00:03:31.549> dynamic<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.299> having

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
cool because the core dynamic of having

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.330 
cool because the core dynamic of having
this<00:03:32.690> weapon<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.260> maybe<00:03:33.530> only<00:03:33.709> has<00:03:33.920> one<00:03:34.190> or

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
this weapon that maybe only has one or

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.979 
this weapon that maybe only has one or
two<00:03:34.459> shots<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.030> people<00:03:35.299> having<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.629> protect

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
two shots and people having to protect

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.740 
two shots and people having to protect
them<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.920> strategy<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.640> get<00:03:37.940> them<00:03:38.150> into<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
them as a strategy to get them into the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.570 
them as a strategy to get them into the
enemy<00:03:39.110> ship<00:03:39.409> and<00:03:39.620> get<00:03:39.890> them<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.250> point<00:03:40.519> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
enemy ship and get them to a point to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.979 
enemy ship and get them to a point to
where<00:03:40.640> they<00:03:40.819> can<00:03:40.879> use<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.239> really<00:03:41.450> excited<00:03:41.959> me

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
where they can use it really excited me

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.619 
where they can use it really excited me
I<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.530> those<00:03:42.799> kind<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.250> ideas<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.480> those

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
I like those kind of ideas I like those

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.020 
I like those kind of ideas I like those
ideas<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.590> whether<00:03:46.190> you're<00:03:46.489> with<00:03:46.640> in<00:03:46.790> team

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
ideas that whether you're with in team

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.600 
ideas that whether you're with in team
deathmatch<00:03:47.239> or<00:03:47.629> not<00:03:47.870> there<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.140> some<00:03:48.739> symmetry

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
deathmatch or not there is some symmetry

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.729 
deathmatch or not there is some symmetry
to<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.879> strategy<00:03:50.390> one<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.049> problems<00:03:51.560> I've

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
to the strategy one of the problems I've

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.500 
to the strategy one of the problems I've
seen<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.610> been<00:03:52.760> playing<00:03:52.970> dirty<00:03:53.180> bomb

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
seen and have been playing dirty bomb

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.000 
seen and have been playing dirty bomb
and<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> couple<00:03:54.049> other<00:03:54.349> games<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.860> that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and a couple other games is that

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.649 
and a couple other games is that
whenever<00:03:55.430> there's<00:03:55.730> an<00:03:55.849> objective<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.420> lot<00:03:56.569> of

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
whenever there's an objective a lot of

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.539 
whenever there's an objective a lot of
times<00:03:56.900> there<00:03:57.440> isn't<00:03:57.799> really<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:58.010> lot<00:03:58.370> of

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
times there isn't really a lot of

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.550 
times there isn't really a lot of
teamwork<00:03:58.849> because<00:03:59.599> the<00:04:00.019> game<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.500> stress

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
teamwork because the game a stress

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.309 
teamwork because the game a stress
teamwork<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.910> all<00:04:02.150> honesty<00:04:02.720> most<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
teamwork but in all honesty most of the

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.309 
teamwork but in all honesty most of the
time<00:04:03.530> just<00:04:03.799> killing<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> other<00:04:04.400> people<00:04:05.060> is

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
time just killing the other people is

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.740 
time just killing the other people is
all<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:06.980> really<00:04:07.310> need<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.519> do<00:04:07.849> here<00:04:08.720> I

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
all that you really need to do here I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900 
all that you really need to do here I
like<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.319> idea<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:10.370> know<00:04:10.400> if<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.730> have

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
like the idea that you know if you have

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.610 
like the idea that you know if you have
this<00:04:11.060> weapon<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.599> you<00:04:11.660> want<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.079> end<00:04:12.410> this

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
this weapon and you want to end this

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.979 
this weapon and you want to end this
battle<00:04:12.859> really<00:04:13.340> quickly<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.239> should<00:04:14.510> protect

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
battle really quickly you should protect

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.620 
battle really quickly you should protect
that<00:04:15.260> person<00:04:15.560> with<00:04:16.370> all<00:04:16.579> your<00:04:17.000> might<00:04:17.209> until

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
that person with all your might until

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.699 
that person with all your might until
they<00:04:17.750> get<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.049> point<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.380> where<00:04:18.470> they<00:04:18.650> can

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
they get to a point to where they can

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.050 
they get to a point to where they can
use<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.949> blow<00:04:19.190> out<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> windows<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.760> suck<00:04:19.940> out

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
use a blow out the windows and suck out

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.460 
use a blow out the windows and suck out
the<00:04:20.120> enemies<00:04:20.479> i<00:04:20.570> just<00:04:20.750> really<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.320> now

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
the enemies i just really like that now

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.689 
the enemies i just really like that now
of<00:04:21.560> course<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.949> can<00:04:22.100> do<00:04:22.220> normal<00:04:22.550> team

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
of course you can do normal team

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.400 
of course you can do normal team
deathmatch<00:04:23.090> within<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.690> ship's<00:04:24.199> themselves

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
deathmatch within the ship's themselves

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.490 
deathmatch within the ship's themselves
and<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.699> kill<00:04:25.970> one<00:04:26.180> another<00:04:26.210> as<00:04:26.660> well<00:04:26.960> but<00:04:27.440> I

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
and and kill one another as well but I

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.050 
and and kill one another as well but I
just<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.160> idea<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.580> there's<00:04:28.850> some

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
just like the idea that there's some

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.570 
just like the idea that there's some
mini<00:04:29.810> Maxine<00:04:30.289> of<00:04:30.410> strategy<00:04:30.889> that's<00:04:31.220> going<00:04:31.490> on

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
mini Maxine of strategy that's going on

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.070 
mini Maxine of strategy that's going on
within<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:32.000> game<00:04:32.180> as<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.419> can<00:04:32.570> see<00:04:32.750> with<00:04:32.900> some

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
within the game as you can see with some

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.960 
within the game as you can see with some
of<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.229> video<00:04:33.500> there's<00:04:33.800> they've<00:04:34.310> got<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.729> lot

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
of the video there's they've got a lot

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.550 
of the video there's they've got a lot
of<00:04:35.030> really<00:04:35.419> cool<00:04:35.450> ideas<00:04:36.200> they've<00:04:36.410> got

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
of really cool ideas they've got

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.990 
of really cool ideas they've got
interiors<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.370> they're<00:04:37.520> working<00:04:37.910> on

interiors that they're working on

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.180 
interiors that they're working on
they've<00:04:38.270> they've<00:04:38.570> come<00:04:38.870> farther<00:04:39.349> i<00:04:39.770> would<00:04:39.950> say

pieces<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.070> then<00:05:19.610> finally<00:05:20.060> we'll<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.270> some

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
pieces and then finally we'll have some

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.180 
pieces and then finally we'll have some
end<00:05:20.750> game<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.410> it'll<00:05:21.680> probably<00:05:21.919> be

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
end game and and it'll probably be

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.620 
end game and and it'll probably be
really<00:05:22.460> cool<00:05:22.639> but<00:05:22.789> it's<00:05:22.940> going<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.090> be<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.419> far

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
really cool but it's going to be so far

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.540 
really cool but it's going to be so far
out<00:05:23.660> in<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.840> future<00:05:24.169> who<00:05:24.320> knows<00:05:24.349> stuff<00:05:25.340> like

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
out in the future who knows stuff like

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.670 
out in the future who knows stuff like
this<00:05:25.760> where<00:05:26.300> somebody<00:05:26.630> identifies<00:05:26.780> what<00:05:27.500> they

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
this where somebody identifies what they

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.890 
this where somebody identifies what they
enjoy<00:05:27.919> about<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.520> game<00:05:28.789> and<00:05:28.940> sort<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.270> snips<00:05:29.660> it

this let's just do it and and see what
happens<00:05:35.599> let's<00:05:35.870> not<00:05:36.229> go<00:05:36.500> out<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.860> our<00:05:36.950> way<00:05:37.010> to

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
happens let's not go out of our way to

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.860 
happens let's not go out of our way to
have<00:05:37.370> exploration<00:05:38.270> or<00:05:38.479> different

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
have exploration or different

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.440 
have exploration or different
planets<00:05:39.260> let's<00:05:39.500> just<00:05:39.800> battle<00:05:40.670> it<00:05:40.820> out<00:05:41.060> I

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
planets let's just battle it out I

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.420 
planets let's just battle it out I
really<00:05:42.140> like<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.410> idea<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.070> how<00:05:43.160> light

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
really like that idea and how light

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.160 
really like that idea and how light
companies<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:44.210> going<00:05:44.570> forth<00:05:44.870> with<00:05:45.050> that

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
companies that are going forth with that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.540 
companies that are going forth with that
route<00:05:45.350> because<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.710> think<00:05:45.770> there's<00:05:46.220> enough

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
route because I think there's enough

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.820 
route because I think there's enough
games<00:05:46.850> out<00:05:47.120> there<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.110> possible<00:05:48.500> for

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
games out there that it's possible for

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.060 
games out there that it's possible for
them<00:05:49.130> all<00:05:49.280> to<00:05:49.370> exist<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.650> here<00:05:51.650> I<00:05:51.830> see

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
them all to exist and here I see

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.680 
them all to exist and here I see
something<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.580> personally<00:05:53.060> I<00:05:53.180> would<00:05:53.510> want

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
something that personally I would want

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.660 
something that personally I would want
to<00:05:53.780> play<00:05:53.960> now<00:05:54.530> whether<00:05:55.070> that<00:05:55.190> comes<00:05:55.520> to

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
to play now whether that comes to

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.100 
to play now whether that comes to
fruition<00:05:55.910> and<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.450> end<00:05:56.630> up<00:05:56.720> wanting<00:05:56.960> to<00:05:57.050> play

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
fruition and I end up wanting to play

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.900 
fruition and I end up wanting to play
when<00:05:57.440> it's<00:05:57.560> all<00:05:57.680> said<00:05:57.920> and<00:05:57.950> done<00:05:58.100> who<00:05:58.640> knows

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
when it's all said and done who knows

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.390 
when it's all said and done who knows
but<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.720> idea<00:06:00.170> behind<00:06:00.440> it<00:06:00.740> is<00:06:00.860> incredibly

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
but the idea behind it is incredibly

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.670 
but the idea behind it is incredibly
solid<00:06:01.760> when<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.480> comes<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.870> my<00:06:02.990> own<00:06:03.230> personal

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
solid when it comes to my own personal

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.800 
solid when it comes to my own personal
opinion<00:06:04.100> and<00:06:04.400> what<00:06:04.760> I<00:06:04.970> like<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:05.480> what<00:06:05.540> I<00:06:05.660> would

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
opinion and what I like and what I would

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.720 
opinion and what I like and what I would
like<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.110> see<00:06:06.470> in<00:06:06.590> a<00:06:06.680> game<00:06:06.950> these<00:06:07.370> guys<00:06:07.520> are

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
like to see in a game these guys are

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
that you know there will be stretch

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.380 
that you know there will be stretch
goals<00:06:15.920> but<00:06:16.100> it<00:06:16.220> seemed<00:06:16.550> like<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.120> this<00:06:17.240> is

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
goals but it seemed like and this is

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.300 
goals but it seemed like and this is
before<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.990> Kickstarter<00:06:18.710> has<00:06:18.740> gone<00:06:18.920> up<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.250> I

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
before the Kickstarter has gone up so I

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.400 
before the Kickstarter has gone up so I
can't<00:06:19.610> guarantee<00:06:20.030> this<00:06:20.480> but<00:06:20.930> it<00:06:21.020> seemed<00:06:21.260> like

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
can't guarantee this but it seemed like

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.040 
can't guarantee this but it seemed like
they<00:06:21.560> had<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.920> very<00:06:22.090> realistic<00:06:23.090> number<00:06:23.810> for

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
they had a very realistic number for

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.290 
they had a very realistic number for
their<00:06:24.170> goal<00:06:24.410> incredibly<00:06:25.190> realistic<00:06:25.610> actually

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
their goal incredibly realistic actually

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.820 
their goal incredibly realistic actually
especially<00:06:26.450> for<00:06:26.870> a<00:06:26.900> game<00:06:27.050> doing<00:06:27.350> this<00:06:27.560> and

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
especially for a game doing this and

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.040 
especially for a game doing this and
they<00:06:28.220> weren't<00:06:28.430> going<00:06:28.820> that<00:06:28.970> you<00:06:29.450> know<00:06:29.570> keep

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
they weren't going that you know keep

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.870 
they weren't going that you know keep
people<00:06:30.440> purchasing<00:06:31.190> kind<00:06:31.520> of<00:06:31.670> mentality

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
people purchasing kind of mentality

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.330 
people purchasing kind of mentality
there's<00:06:32.780> going<00:06:32.960> to<00:06:33.080> be<00:06:33.110> things<00:06:33.500> like<00:06:33.710> small

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
there's going to be things like small

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.580 
there's going to be things like small
gangs<00:06:34.670> or<00:06:35.060> clans<00:06:35.390> that<00:06:35.630> you<00:06:35.810> can<00:06:35.990> join<00:06:36.230> up<00:06:36.440> and

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
gangs or clans that you can join up and

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.440 
gangs or clans that you can join up and
so<00:06:36.770> forth<00:06:37.040> and<00:06:37.160> I<00:06:37.340> think<00:06:37.730> that<00:06:37.880> sort<00:06:38.150> of<00:06:38.210> in

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
so forth and I think that sort of in

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.720 
so forth and I think that sort of in
discussion<00:06:39.380> when<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.590> talk<00:06:39.950> to<00:06:39.980> them<00:06:40.250> about<00:06:40.430> how

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
discussion when I talk to them about how

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.610 
discussion when I talk to them about how
they<00:06:40.760> were<00:06:40.940> going<00:06:41.120> to<00:06:41.180> roll<00:06:41.480> that<00:06:41.510> out<00:06:41.720> to<00:06:42.170> make

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
they were going to roll that out to make

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.560 
they were going to roll that out to make
people<00:06:42.800> want<00:06:43.130> to<00:06:43.280> continue<00:06:43.730> to<00:06:43.850> play<00:06:44.090> and<00:06:44.360> want

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
people want to continue to play and want

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.630 
people want to continue to play and want
to<00:06:44.630> continue<00:06:44.750> to<00:06:45.140> work<00:06:45.380> together<00:06:45.620> I<00:06:46.130> really

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
to continue to work together I really

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.190 
to continue to work together I really
like<00:06:46.820> the<00:06:47.000> idea<00:06:47.030> I<00:06:47.390> think<00:06:47.570> it<00:06:47.900> looked

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
like the idea I think it looked

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.960 
like the idea I think it looked
phenomenal<00:06:48.710> I<00:06:49.340> think<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.670> they've<00:06:49.790> got<00:06:49.940> a

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970
