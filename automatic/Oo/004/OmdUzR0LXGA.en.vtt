with<00:00:25.320> these<00:00:25.500> kinds<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.980> odds<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.460> won't<00:00:26.970> be

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
with these kinds of odds I won't be

with these kinds of odds I won't be
making<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.510> sudden<00:00:27.900> moves<00:00:28.310> but<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.460> doesn't

making any sudden moves but that doesn't
mean<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.179> let<00:00:30.510> Metal<00:00:30.779> Gear<00:00:30.810> be

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
mean we can just let Metal Gear be

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.280 
mean we can just let Metal Gear be
hijacked<00:00:31.650> okay<00:00:32.369> okay<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> photos
