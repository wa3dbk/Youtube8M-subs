00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.700 
day to night and then zombies would come
out<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.600> what<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:42.870> happened<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
out and what what happened is the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.000 
out and what what happened is the
zombies<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.600> attack<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
zombies would attack you as well so you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
zombies would attack you as well so you
could<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.239> point<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.170> would

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
could the point would be that you would

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
could the point would be that you would
either<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.039> fight<00:00:50.280> off<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> zombies<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
either have to fight off the zombies and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.869 
either have to fight off the zombies and
try<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> die<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.340> even<00:00:53.550> work

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
try not to die you could even work

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
try not to die you could even work
together<00:00:54.149> um<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.730> die<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> guess<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
together um and not die I guess or you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
together um and not die I guess or you
could<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.430> type<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> guy<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.390> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
could just be a type of guy that just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170 
could just be a type of guy that just
kills<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.739> enemy<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.640> tries<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
kills your enemy and then tries to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570 
kills your enemy and then tries to
survive<00:01:03.449> through<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> zombies<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
survive through the zombies now you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.130 
survive through the zombies now you
would<00:01:05.820> only<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.600> life<00:01:07.610> well<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.990> take<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
would only get one life well I take that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
would only get one life well I take that
back<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.189> happen<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> would<00:01:11.909> be

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
back what would happen is it would be

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.370 
back what would happen is it would be
like<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> free-for-all<00:01:12.510> base<00:01:12.990> game<00:01:13.430> but<00:01:15.380> until

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
like a free-for-all base game but until

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
like a free-for-all base game but until
it<00:01:16.409> changed<00:01:16.890> night<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.000> get

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it changed night then you would only get

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.890 
it changed night then you would only get
one<00:01:18.420> life<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.990> guess<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.890> until<00:01:20.220> day<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900

the<00:01:45.810> people<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.770> trying<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> kill<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the people that are trying to kill the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.469 
the people that are trying to kill the
zombies<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:49.070> kill<00:01:50.070> zombies<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.329> know

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
zombies or you kill zombies or you know

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
zombies or you kill zombies or you know
like<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> point<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.310> point

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
like like that and the point the point

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
like like that and the point the point
of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> game<00:01:53.759> play<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.899> game<00:01:55.049> type<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.409> be

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
of the game play the game type would be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.639 
of the game play the game type would be
to<00:01:55.740> survive<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.340> long<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to survive as long as you can and but it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.450 
to survive as long as you can and but it
would<00:01:58.740> still<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> free-for-all

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
would still be like a free-for-all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.300 
would still be like a free-for-all
because<00:02:00.409> maybe<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.590> wouldn't<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> free<00:02:02.130> from

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because maybe it wouldn't be a free from

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.789 
because maybe it wouldn't be a free from
maybe<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> whole<00:02:02.850> point<00:02:03.060> would<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.799> hmm

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
maybe the whole point would be hmm

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
maybe the whole point would be hmm
survive<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.490> long<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.750> maybe<00:02:06.899> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
survive as long as you can so maybe it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.020 
survive as long as you can so maybe it
would<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.799> map<00:02:08.929> like

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
would be a really big map like

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.420 
would be a really big map like
I'm<00:02:11.240> not<00:02:11.390> sure<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.470> big<00:02:12.500> map<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.040> guess<00:02:13.220> kind

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'm not sure of a big map I guess kind

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.860 
I'm not sure of a big map I guess kind
of<00:02:13.490> like<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.760> map<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.420> not<00:02:14.569> it's<00:02:14.690> pretty

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
of like this map it's not it's pretty

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.699 
of like this map it's not it's pretty
big<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:16.459> wouldn't<00:02:16.730> be<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.090> um<00:02:17.590> cluttered<00:02:18.590> I

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
big but it wouldn't be is um cluttered I

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.420 
big but it wouldn't be is um cluttered I
guess<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:21.080> could<00:02:21.500> fight<00:02:22.040> off<00:02:22.069> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
guess and then you could fight off the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.780 
guess and then you could fight off the
zombies<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.950> could<00:02:25.100> also<00:02:25.250> kill<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
zombies and then you could also kill the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.040 
zombies and then you could also kill the
other<00:02:25.910> people<00:02:26.270> if<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.510> kill<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> other

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
other people if you kill the other

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.699 
other people if you kill the other
people<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.040> they're<00:02:28.250> dead<00:02:28.550> until<00:02:29.380> until<00:02:30.380> um

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
people then they're dead until until um

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.420 
people then they're dead until until um
i<00:02:31.870> guess<00:02:32.870> i<00:02:33.260> guess<00:02:33.410> i<00:02:33.620> would<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.980> i<00:02:34.010> guess<00:02:34.310> i

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
i guess i guess i would be it i guess i

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.520 
i guess i guess i would be it i guess i
just<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.760> dead<00:02:34.940> once<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.380> uh<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.640> maybe<00:02:38.380> look<00:02:39.380> at

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
just be dead once so uh so maybe look at

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.090 
just be dead once so uh so maybe look at
that<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:39.980> what<00:02:40.280> oh<00:02:41.080> my<00:02:42.080> gosh<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.770> was<00:02:42.830> funny

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
that like what oh my gosh that was funny

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.780 
that like what oh my gosh that was funny
um<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.420> let's<00:02:44.720> think<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:44.989> through<00:02:45.140> okay<00:02:45.790> so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
um so let's think this through okay so

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.940 
um so let's think this through okay so
it'd<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> map<00:02:47.420> maybe<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.440> would<00:02:48.530> already<00:02:48.680> be

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
it'd be a map maybe it would already be

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.320 
it'd be a map maybe it would already be
night<00:02:49.220> maybe<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.580> would<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.000> would<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.300> be

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
night maybe it would that would just be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.420 
night maybe it would that would just be
the<00:02:50.450> complete<00:02:50.870> objective<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.830> would<00:02:52.100> be<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> big

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the complete objective it would be a big

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.930 
the complete objective it would be a big
map<00:02:52.670> good<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:54.019> six<00:02:54.320> people<00:02:54.680> it'd<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.519> big<00:02:55.760> map

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
map good be six people it'd be a big map

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.809 
map good be six people it'd be a big map
and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.690> zombies<00:02:57.110> would<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.440> coming

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
and then the zombies would be coming

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.160 
and then the zombies would be coming
they<00:02:58.819> wouldn't<00:02:59.060> start<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.569> guess<00:02:59.600> right<00:02:59.900> away

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
they wouldn't start I guess right away

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.570 
they wouldn't start I guess right away
you<00:03:00.230> could<00:03:00.530> start<00:03:00.739> off<00:03:00.890> maybe<00:03:01.130> they'd<00:03:01.340> start

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
you could start off maybe they'd start

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.580 
you could start off maybe they'd start
in<00:03:01.730> 30<00:03:01.850> seconds<00:03:02.239> after<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.569> round<00:03:02.690> start<00:03:02.989> but

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
in 30 seconds after the round start but

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.840 
in 30 seconds after the round start but
I<00:03:03.620> mean<00:03:03.830> there<00:03:03.950> would<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.100> some<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.400> them<00:03:04.640> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
I mean there would be some of them and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.699 
I mean there would be some of them and
then<00:03:05.090> there<00:03:05.209> would<00:03:05.330> be<00:03:05.360> lots<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.840> them<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:06.560> the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
then there would be lots of them so the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.890 
then there would be lots of them so the
point<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.910> kill<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.269> zombies<00:03:08.660> and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
point is you can kill the zombies and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.620 
point is you can kill the zombies and
you<00:03:09.830> can<00:03:10.010> kill<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.310> other<00:03:10.459> players<00:03:10.730> now<00:03:11.569> do

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
you can kill the other players now do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.559 
you can kill the other players now do
you<00:03:11.900> benefit<00:03:12.230> from<00:03:12.290> killing<00:03:12.680> other<00:03:12.890> players

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
you benefit from killing other players

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.520 
you benefit from killing other players
probably<00:03:14.569> not<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:15.500> if<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.769> kill<00:03:16.040> them<00:03:16.269> then

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
probably not but if you kill them then

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.620 
probably not but if you kill them then
they<00:03:18.530> can<00:03:19.430> survive<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.060> maybe<00:03:20.239> they<00:03:20.420> have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
they can survive and maybe they have

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.170 
they can survive and maybe they have
maybe<00:03:21.260> they<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.709> three<00:03:22.489> times<00:03:22.760> as<00:03:23.000> much

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
maybe they have like three times as much

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.390 
maybe they have like three times as much
juggernaut<00:03:23.780> like<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.110> zombies<00:03:24.590> are<00:03:24.620> only<00:03:25.040> are

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
juggernaut like the zombies are only are

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.259 
juggernaut like the zombies are only are
only<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.980> know<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.400> one<00:03:28.970> hundred<00:03:29.239> percent

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
only you know like one hundred percent

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.449 
only you know like one hundred percent
health<00:03:29.780> whereas<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> other<00:03:30.470> players<00:03:30.980> would

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
health whereas the other players would

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.199 
health whereas the other players would
have<00:03:31.570> five<00:03:32.570> hundred<00:03:32.900> percent<00:03:33.200> health<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.310> well

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
have five hundred percent health so well

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.530 
have five hundred percent health so well
at<00:03:35.390> least<00:03:35.829> towards<00:03:36.829> other<00:03:37.010> players<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
at least towards other players the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.750 
at least towards other players the
zombies<00:03:38.900> could<00:03:39.110> kill<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.829> if<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.670> get

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
zombies could kill you and if you get

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.280 
zombies could kill you and if you get
overwhelmed<00:03:41.390> just<00:03:41.450> like<00:03:41.660> regular<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.200> would

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
overwhelmed just like regular it would

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.560 
overwhelmed just like regular it would
just<00:03:42.380> be<00:03:42.530> like<00:03:42.560> your<00:03:42.829> juggernaut<00:03:43.609> I<00:03:43.640> guess<00:03:43.880> but

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
just be like your juggernaut I guess but

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.960 
just be like your juggernaut I guess but
you'd<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.840> kill<00:03:44.989> all<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.230> zombies<00:03:45.970> there

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
you'd have to kill all the zombies there

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.210 
you'd have to kill all the zombies there
would<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.120> animals<00:03:47.660> maybe<00:03:48.650> could<00:03:48.920> choose<00:03:49.070> your

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
would be animals maybe could choose your

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.009 
would be animals maybe could choose your
own<00:03:49.250> class<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:49.940> there<00:03:50.150> would<00:03:50.390> be<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.570> mole

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
own class and that there would be a mole

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.300 
own class and that there would be a mole
up<00:03:51.609> there<00:03:52.609> would<00:03:52.760> be<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:53.030> mo<00:03:53.329> um<00:03:54.160> what<00:03:55.160> am<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
up there would be a mo um what am I

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.979 
up there would be a mo um what am I
trying<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.549> say<00:03:55.700> there<00:03:55.910> would<00:03:56.060> be<00:03:56.090> ammo<00:03:56.630> crates

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
trying to say there would be ammo crates

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.890 
trying to say there would be ammo crates
in<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.320> area<00:03:57.890> but<00:03:58.040> you'd<00:03:58.130> have<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.280> find<00:03:58.640> them

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
in the area but you'd have to find them

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.180 
in the area but you'd have to find them
maybe<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.109> isn't<00:04:00.290> really<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.620> call<00:04:00.859> of<00:04:00.980> duty

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
maybe this isn't really a call of duty

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.780 
maybe this isn't really a call of duty
game<00:04:01.370> maybe<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.180> new<00:04:02.329> game<00:04:02.510> all<00:04:02.750> together

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
game maybe it's a new game all together

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.490 
game maybe it's a new game all together
but<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.120> think<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.750> would<00:04:05.930> be<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> cool<00:04:06.350> idea

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
but I think that would be a cool idea

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.420 
but I think that would be a cool idea
and<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:07.820> would<00:04:08.420> love<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.630> play<00:04:08.750> if<00:04:09.560> there's<00:04:10.370> a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
and I would love to play if there's a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.800 
and I would love to play if there's a
developer<00:04:10.910> out<00:04:10.970> there<00:04:11.120> there's<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.359> hey<00:04:11.600> I'm

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
developer out there there's like hey I'm

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.090 
developer out there there's like hey I'm
trying<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.049> think<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.410> game<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.680> make<00:04:12.799> make

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
trying to think of a game to make make

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.120 
trying to think of a game to make make
that<00:04:13.310> make<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.450> where<00:04:14.600> you<00:04:14.720> it's<00:04:15.109> it's<00:04:15.590> free

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
that make it where you it's it's free

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.190 
that make it where you it's it's free
for<00:04:16.280> all<00:04:16.400> based<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.120> can<00:04:17.269> play<00:04:17.419> with<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.810> don't

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
for all based you can play with I don't

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.960 
for all based you can play with I don't
know<00:04:18.260> how<00:04:18.350> many<00:04:18.530> people<00:04:18.560> six<00:04:19.039> maybe<00:04:19.310> maybe<00:04:19.640> ten

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
know how many people six maybe maybe ten

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.969 
know how many people six maybe maybe ten
because<00:04:20.870> usually<00:04:21.019> there's<00:04:21.380> 12<00:04:21.620> on<00:04:21.739> our<00:04:21.830> team

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
because usually there's 12 on our team

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.960 
because usually there's 12 on our team
so<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.220> can<00:04:22.340> at<00:04:22.430> least<00:04:22.520> host<00:04:22.820> 12

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so you can at least host 12

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.150 
so you can at least host 12
there<00:04:24.090> would<00:04:24.180> be<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.300> lot<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.630> zombies<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.470> then

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
there would be a lot of zombies and then

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.190 
there would be a lot of zombies and then
you<00:04:26.580> could<00:04:26.760> work<00:04:26.910> together<00:04:27.120> maybe<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:28.020> know

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
you could work together maybe you know

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.510 
you could work together maybe you know
the<00:04:28.380> whole<00:04:28.530> point<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.980> trying<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> see<00:04:29.370> how<00:04:29.460> far

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the whole point is trying to see how far

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.880 
the whole point is trying to see how far
you<00:04:29.850> can<00:04:29.880> survive<00:04:30.270> i<00:04:30.330> guess<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.290> maybe<00:04:31.650> you

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
you can survive i guess so maybe you

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.200 
you can survive i guess so maybe you
could<00:04:32.100> work<00:04:32.130> with<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.550> other<00:04:32.700> team<00:04:32.940> or<00:04:33.120> you

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
could work with the other team or you

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.080 
could work with the other team or you
could<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.360> be<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> dick<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.140> kill<00:04:34.380> them<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.860> I

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
could just be a dick and kill them and I

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.340 
could just be a dick and kill them and I
would<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.300> think<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.750> would<00:04:36.870> be<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> good<00:04:37.170> game

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
would I think it would be a good game

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.830 
would I think it would be a good game
type<00:04:37.590> maybe<00:04:37.830> not<00:04:38.070> call<00:04:38.310> duty<00:04:38.520> game<00:04:38.760> type<00:04:39.000> maybe
