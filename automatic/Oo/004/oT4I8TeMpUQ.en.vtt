00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
firing independently of each other so as

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.550 
firing independently of each other so as
I've<00:00:20.310> been<00:00:20.789> kind<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.570> hyping<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> m3<00:00:22.470> as

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I've been kind of hyping up the m3 as

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.870 
I've been kind of hyping up the m3 as
one<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> tanks<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.609> looking

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
one of the tanks I'm really looking

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.359 
one of the tanks I'm really looking
forward<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.210> trying<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:26.160> it'll<00:00:26.279> be

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
forward to trying out I think it'll be

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.519 
forward to trying out I think it'll be
fun<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.660> people<00:00:27.779> give<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> bad

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
fun and a lot of people give it a bad

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
fun and a lot of people give it a bad
rap<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> fairly<00:00:30.119> decent

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
rap but it was actually a fairly decent

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.979 
rap but it was actually a fairly decent
tank<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> early<00:00:32.460> period<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.270> World<00:00:33.630> War<00:00:33.719> 2

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.510 
tank for the early period of World War 2
in<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> fought<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
in which it fought you know but

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
in which it fought you know but
obviously<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.210> tank<00:00:37.020> technology<00:00:37.649> advanced

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
obviously as tank technology advanced

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030 
obviously as tank technology advanced
the<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.399> soon<00:00:38.910> became<00:00:39.510> obsolete<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the thing soon became obsolete but the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
the thing soon became obsolete but the
Brits<00:00:41.280> had<00:00:41.489> their<00:00:41.640> own<00:00:41.670> m3<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.780> called

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
Brits had their own m3 and they called

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
Brits had their own m3 and they called
it<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.170> General<00:00:43.739> Grant<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.149> General

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it the General Grant so you got General

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.920 
it the General Grant so you got General
Lee<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.989> General<00:00:46.500> Grant<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.730> American<00:00:48.539> Civil

what is believed to be patch 1.45 and is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
what is believed to be patch 1.45 and is
hopefully<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> horizon<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.390> guess

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
hopefully on the horizon so your guess

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
hopefully on the horizon so your guess
is<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.780> good<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.170> mine<00:01:19.290> whether<00:01:19.770> we'll<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
is as good as mine whether we'll see it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
is as good as mine whether we'll see it
before<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> new<00:01:21.390> year<00:01:21.420> after<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.530> let<00:01:22.920> me

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
before the new year after but let me

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
before the new year after but let me
know<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.250> ones<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.840> of

Lee<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> beast<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.090> since<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
Lee and it was a beast but since the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.179 
Lee and it was a beast but since the
Germans<00:01:51.930> took<00:01:52.049> over<00:01:52.290> France<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> Germans

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Germans took over France the Germans

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
Germans took over France the Germans
used<00:01:53.520> these<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> use<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.630> high<00:01:54.840> amounts

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
used these and use them in high amounts

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.190 
used these and use them in high amounts
like<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.460> 160<00:01:57.329> used<00:01:58.020> by

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
like I think there was over 160 used by

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.999 
like I think there was over 160 used by
the<00:01:58.259> German<00:01:58.680> forces<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:01.500> lot<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.890> were

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the German forces and a lot of them were

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
the German forces and a lot of them were
even<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.149> used<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> holes

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
even like you know they used the holes

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.969 
even like you know they used the holes
later<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> converted<00:02:05.250> into<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:05.640> tanks

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
later to be converted into other tanks

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.029 
later to be converted into other tanks
there's<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.340> kinds<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.209> cool<00:02:10.039> modifications

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there's all kinds of cool modifications

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.309 
there's all kinds of cool modifications
that<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.310> Germans<00:02:11.610> did<00:02:11.819> on

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
that the Germans did on

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.539 
that the Germans did on
on<00:02:13.219> the<00:02:13.459> Charpy<00:02:13.730> ones<00:02:14.140> down<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> tank<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.430> it

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
on the Charpy ones down the tank but it

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.699 
on the Charpy ones down the tank but it
makes<00:02:16.700> me<00:02:16.819> wonder<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.510> would<00:02:18.170> love<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.409> see<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
makes me wonder I would love to see a

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.800 
makes me wonder I would love to see a
char<00:02:19.010> b1<00:02:19.129> as<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> German<00:02:19.939> French<00:02:20.239> tank<00:02:20.569> I've

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
char b1 as a German French tank I've

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.750 
char b1 as a German French tank I've
kind<00:02:21.079> of<00:02:21.139> advocated<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> while<00:02:22.189> but<00:02:22.549> I

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
kind of advocated that for a while but I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.080 
kind of advocated that for a while but I
think<00:02:23.329> they're<00:02:24.019> both<00:02:24.379> similar<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.189> style<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
think they're both similar in style you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.089 
think they're both similar in style you
know<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.359> both<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.749> the<00:02:26.900> howitzer<00:02:27.409> in<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
know they both have the howitzer in the

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.800 
know they both have the howitzer in the
hole<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.549> then<00:02:28.939> they've<00:02:29.120> got<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.420> turret<00:02:29.719> on

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hole and then they've got the turret on

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.569 
hole and then they've got the turret on
the<00:02:29.930> top<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.500> i<00:02:30.709> just<00:02:30.980> wanted<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> show<00:02:31.549> that

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
the top so i just wanted to show that

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.929 
the top so i just wanted to show that
but<00:02:32.859> actually<00:02:33.859> that<00:02:34.189> kind<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.519> brings<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.879> a

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
but actually that kind of brings up a

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.479 
but actually that kind of brings up a
question<00:02:34.969> water<00:02:35.689> what<00:02:36.469> tanks<00:02:36.950> would<00:02:37.099> you<00:02:37.310> love

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
question water what tanks would you love

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.390 
question water what tanks would you love
to<00:02:37.549> see<00:02:37.700> as<00:02:38.349> german<00:02:39.349> premiums<00:02:39.919> and<00:02:40.159> even

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to see as german premiums and even

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.890 
to see as german premiums and even
Russian<00:02:40.790> premiums<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.389> you<00:02:41.569> know<00:02:41.689> obviously

Russian premiums that you know obviously

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.050 
Russian premiums that you know obviously
aren't<00:02:42.439> reskin<00:02:43.099> ones<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.459> i'm<00:02:43.609> thinking<00:02:43.639> like

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
aren't reskin ones but i'm thinking like

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.300 
aren't reskin ones but i'm thinking like
tanks<00:02:44.689> from<00:02:44.840> other<00:02:45.079> nations<00:02:45.469> it's<00:02:46.010> something
