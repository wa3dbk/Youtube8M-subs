is important for us now but also set

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
is important for us now but also set
this<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.160> better<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> future<00:00:56.960> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
this up a little better in the future to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
this up a little better in the future to
give<00:00:58.170> me<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.320> idea<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.710> maybe<00:00:58.949> why<00:00:59.280> it's<00:01:00.059> better

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
give me an idea of maybe why it's better

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
give me an idea of maybe why it's better
now<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.140> Jack<00:01:01.559> maybe<00:01:01.800> wasn't

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
now what what about Jack maybe wasn't

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
now what what about Jack maybe wasn't
fitting<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.809> maybe<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.379> there

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
fitting in right now and maybe was there

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410 
fitting in right now and maybe was there
a<00:01:04.559> contract<00:01:05.070> situation<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:06.299> just

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
a contract situation here that they just

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000 
a contract situation here that they just
made<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> better<00:01:06.990> bet<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.470> Andrew<00:01:07.740> anger

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
made it a better bet to get Andrew anger

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.609 
made it a better bet to get Andrew anger
into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> mix<00:01:08.450> yeah<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.960> wasn't<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.409> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
into the mix yeah it wasn't about just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.859 
into the mix yeah it wasn't about just
uh<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:12.090> Andrews<00:01:12.720> better<00:01:13.140> than<00:01:13.500> Jack<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.250> um

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
uh that Andrews better than Jack now um

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
uh that Andrews better than Jack now um
because<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.049> both<00:01:16.409> young<00:01:16.799> guys<00:01:17.040> have

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because I think both young guys have

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
because I think both young guys have
have<00:01:17.909> qualities<00:01:20.060> I'm<00:01:21.060> yet<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.689> year<00:01:21.930> now

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I will address that i think that the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.649 
I will address that i think that the
type<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.580> style<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.880> trying<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> play<00:01:27.450> right

feel<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.420> uh<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
feel like we have a good one uh and

Andrew<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.430> then<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> long-term

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
Andrew and then the long-term

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
Andrew and then the long-term
implications<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.369> Jackson<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
implications are that you know Jackson a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
implications are that you know Jackson a
contract<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:07.220> Andrews<00:02:08.220> got<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> couple<00:02:08.729> more

contract on Andrews got a couple more
years<00:02:09.660> left<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.349> uh<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:11.160> important<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.730> us

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
years left and uh it's important for us

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.880 
years left and uh it's important for us
to<00:02:11.879> think<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.750> based<00:02:13.140> ends<00:02:13.530> now

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to think about based ends now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and wonder if the finishing ability was

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.110 
and wonder if the finishing ability was
there<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> know<00:02:23.040> he<00:02:23.190> played<00:02:23.370> central<00:02:23.730> defender

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
there I know he played central defender

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
there I know he played central defender

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
in the past I can't imagine you'll be

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.630 
in the past I can't imagine you'll be
moving<00:02:25.590> them<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:25.980> after<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.400> move<00:02:26.520> out

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
moving them there after you move out

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.710 
moving them there after you move out
you're<00:02:26.760> starting<00:02:27.030> soon<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> centre-forward

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you're starting soon a centre-forward

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960 
you're starting soon a centre-forward
but<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:28.980> any<00:02:29.130> concerns<00:02:29.580> you've<00:02:29.790> seen

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but do you see any concerns you've seen

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
but do you see any concerns you've seen
the<00:02:30.030> ability<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.660> his<00:02:31.170> inability<00:02:31.470> maybe

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the ability to that his inability maybe

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.170 
the ability to that his inability maybe
at<00:02:32.130> times<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.610> finish<00:02:32.940> effectively<00:02:34.400> yeah<00:02:35.400> you

at times to finish effectively yeah you
know<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> won't<00:02:36.570> discount<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.530> Andrew<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
know I won't discount that Andrew I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.050 
know I won't discount that Andrew I
think<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
think that what you have and you have a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.360 
think that what you have and you have a
player<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.290> compare<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.860> two<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.220> them

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

player if you compare the two of them
jack<00:02:45.060> has<00:02:45.239> certainly<00:02:45.600> had<00:02:45.750> more

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
jack has certainly had more

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.130 
jack has certainly had more
opportunities<00:02:46.860> than<00:02:46.890> andreos<00:02:47.520> had<00:02:47.760> uh<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
opportunities than andreos had uh the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
opportunities than andreos had uh the
last<00:02:49.380> couple<00:02:49.739> years<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> think<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
last couple years and I think that that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.870 
last couple years and I think that that
is<00:02:51.270> important<00:02:51.900> uh<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.950> whole<00:02:53.160> piece<00:02:53.430> you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
is important uh to this whole piece you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.509 
is important uh to this whole piece you
know<00:02:54.000> we're<00:02:54.239> not<00:02:54.450> looking<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.220> Andrew<00:02:56.220> just

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
know we're not looking for Andrew just

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.820 
know we're not looking for Andrew just
to<00:02:57.120> come<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.570> score<00:02:57.660> goals<00:02:57.840> he<00:02:58.709> will

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to come in and score goals he will

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.699 
to come in and score goals he will
clearly<00:02:59.310> need<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> do<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.209> us<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.560> it's

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
clearly need to do that for us but it's

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.460 
clearly need to do that for us but it's
making<00:03:02.700> sure<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.239> overall<00:03:03.570> he<00:03:03.930> fits<00:03:04.200> into

Connor is really important to our team
clearly<00:03:33.329> Jack<00:03:33.630> was<00:03:33.930> getting<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.350> most

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
clearly Jack was getting the most

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 
clearly Jack was getting the most
opportunities<00:03:35.250> earlier<00:03:35.579> in<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> season<00:03:35.940> but

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
opportunities earlier in the season but

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.180 
opportunities earlier in the season but
we<00:03:36.420> always<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.959> idea<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.890> Connor

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
we always have the idea that that Connor

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.090 
we always have the idea that that Connor
was<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.730> play<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> big<00:03:39.120> part<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.510> our<00:03:39.630> team
