slam me after that so that was least to
my<00:03:07.849> problems<00:03:08.180> bigger<00:03:08.360> problem<00:03:08.660> i<00:03:08.720> had<00:03:08.870> was

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
my problems bigger problem i had was

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.330 
my problems bigger problem i had was
when<00:03:09.020> i<00:03:09.140> was<00:03:09.200> leading<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.650> 11<00:03:09.950> pushed<00:03:10.160> me

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
when i was leading in the 11 pushed me

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.260 
when i was leading in the 11 pushed me
all<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> way<00:03:10.550> through<00:03:10.730> one<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:10.970> two<00:03:11.060> and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
all the way through one and two and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.360 
all the way through one and two and
eventually<00:03:11.690> lost<00:03:12.380> control<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.890> carnet<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.310> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
eventually lost control the carnet so it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.150 
eventually lost control the carnet so it
pulled<00:03:13.520> me<00:03:13.550> back<00:03:13.640> there<00:03:13.970> but<00:03:14.800> i'm<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:15.860> hard

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
pulled me back there but i'm just hard

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.030 
pulled me back there but i'm just hard
racing<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.660> was<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.470> those<00:03:18.590> days<00:03:18.650> i

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
racing so it was one of those days i

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.080 
racing so it was one of those days i
thought<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.310> had<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.520> thing<00:03:19.700> won<00:03:19.850> at<00:03:19.970> one

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
thought we had this thing won at one

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.750 
thought we had this thing won at one
point<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.569> then<00:03:21.140> restart<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.280> didn't<00:03:22.550> work<00:03:22.640> out

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
point and then restart I didn't work out

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000 
point and then restart I didn't work out

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so well for us and then as everybody was

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.380 
so well for us and then as everybody was
out<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.220> control<00:03:25.519> back<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:25.910> their<00:03:26.030> race<00:03:26.180> and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
out of control back in their race and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.930 
out of control back in their race and
body<00:03:26.540> slam<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.099> 83<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.280> 11<00:03:28.580> went<00:03:28.760> out<00:03:28.849> it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
for a little bit we were bump-drafting

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.160 
for a little bit we were bump-drafting
down<00:03:31.640> straightaway<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:32.150> hell<00:03:32.480> has<00:03:32.660> some<00:03:32.870> wild

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
down straightaway as hell has some wild

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.240 
down straightaway as hell has some wild
racing<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.560> didn't<00:03:33.739> think<00:03:33.800> we<00:03:33.950> could<00:03:33.980> rates

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
racing I didn't think we could rates

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.590 
racing I didn't think we could rates
like<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.580> on<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> mile<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> half<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
like that on a mile and a half the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.330 
like that on a mile and a half the
double-file<00:03:36.019> research<00:03:36.440> as<00:03:36.620> wild<00:03:36.980> as<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.130> have

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
double-file research as wild as you have

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.430 
double-file research as wild as you have
seen<00:03:37.489> them<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.940> would<00:03:38.660> say<00:03:38.840> more<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.260> think

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
seen them I would say more so I think

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.390 
seen them I would say more so I think
we're<00:03:39.680> all<00:03:39.799> giving<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.069> more<00:03:40.220> comfortable

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
with it the car you can actually lean on

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.250 
with it the car you can actually lean on
each<00:03:43.580> other<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.060> really<00:03:44.959> make

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
each other and really make

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.809 
each other and really make
bumper-to-bumper<00:03:45.950> contact<00:03:46.610> on<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
bumper-to-bumper contact on the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.870 
bumper-to-bumper contact on the
straightaways<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:48.950> it's<00:03:49.459> like<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.610> short

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
straightaways and it's it's like a short

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.270 
straightaways and it's it's like a short
track<00:03:50.120> at<00:03:50.239> 190<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:50.989> it's<00:03:51.260> great<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:52.010> we're

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
track at 190 and it's great but we're

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.620 
track at 190 and it's great but we're
all<00:03:52.400> getting<00:03:52.700> more<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:52.970> more<00:03:53.030> confident<00:03:53.480> with

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
all getting more and more confident with

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.030 
all getting more and more confident with
it<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.959> pretty<00:03:54.410> soon<00:03:54.590> we<00:03:54.709> have<00:03:54.830> some<00:03:54.950> big

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
it and pretty soon we have some big

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.370 
it and pretty soon we have some big
polyps
