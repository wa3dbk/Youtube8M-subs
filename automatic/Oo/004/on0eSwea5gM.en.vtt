do I have to do and stuff like that and
I<00:00:16.350> thought<00:00:16.529> it'd<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:16.740> easier<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I thought it'd be just easier if I

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.580 
I thought it'd be just easier if I
created<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.850> video<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.500> you

created this video for you guys so you
just<00:00:19.710> pretty<00:00:19.890> much<00:00:19.980> follow<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.490> video

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
just pretty much follow this video

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.910 
just pretty much follow this video
instead<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.539> asking<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.289> could<00:00:22.500> join<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
instead just asking how i could join and

instead just asking how i could join and
stuff<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:24.570> thing<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
stuff like that so the first thing is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.620 
stuff like that so the first thing is
that<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.160> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> become<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> gfx<00:00:27.300> what

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
the clips like like you get them often
because<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.930> gave<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> month<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because you know we gave you a month to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
because you know we gave you a month to
do<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> second

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
do it because if you just do the second

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
do it because if you just do the second
option<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.590> could<00:01:37.710> happen<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.400> got

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
option what could happen is that you got

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.039 
option what could happen is that you got
you<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.509> five<00:01:39.689> clips

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you probably could got those five clips

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.100 
you probably could got those five clips
in<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.770> one-year<00:01:41.220> time<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.329> that's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
in a one-year time so pretty much that's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
in a one-year time so pretty much that's
my<00:01:43.320> point<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> first

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
my point is that if you do do the first

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
my point is that if you do do the first
option<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.040> lenient

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
option will be a little bit more lenient

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
option will be a little bit more lenient
on<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.570> clips<00:01:48.840> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
on how good you are with your clips but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
on how good you are with your clips but
pretty<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.560> either<00:01:49.799> way<00:01:50.040> we're<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
pretty much either way we're going to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270 
pretty much either way we're going to
actually<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.020> pretty<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.140> add<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.950> either

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

why I made this video I said in the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
20 train I purrs and stuff like that but

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100 
20 train I purrs and stuff like that but
I<00:02:49.620> must<00:02:50.220> say<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.700> our<00:02:50.850> next<00:02:51.180> video<00:02:51.480> will

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
I must say is that our next video will

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.230 
I must say is that our next video will
probably<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> teen<00:02:53.220> Tosh<00:02:53.430> matter<00:02:53.700> what<00:02:53.940> it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
probably be a teen Tosh matter what it

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.540 
probably be a teen Tosh matter what it
probably<00:02:54.810> won't<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.110> another<00:02:55.350> commentary<00:02:56.310> by

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
probably won't be another commentary by
