move<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.109> away<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.039> mean<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.550> can

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
move you away from that I mean I can

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
move you away from that I mean I can
stand<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.359> 150<00:00:22.020> pounds<00:00:22.350> which<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.560> weigh

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
stand here at 150 pounds which I weigh

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.849 
stand here at 150 pounds which I weigh
right<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.490> also<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.240> 135<00:00:25.140> pounds<00:00:25.170> and

right now and also at 135 pounds and
look<00:00:25.949> exactly<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.550> same<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
look exactly the same because of the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.290 
look exactly the same because of the
muscle<00:00:27.510> mass<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.310> really

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
muscle mass that I have so it's really

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790

yourself once a week I personally never

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.760 
yourself once a week I personally never
weigh<00:01:23.159> myself<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.970> scale<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.840> collected

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
against weighing yourself once a week

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
against weighing yourself once a week
because<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:29.579> maybe<00:01:29.850> once<00:01:30.150> every<00:01:30.299> 30<00:01:30.659> days

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
because I mean maybe once every 30 days

because I mean maybe once every 30 days
yeah<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> might<00:01:31.500> find<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.979> big<00:01:32.549> difference<00:01:32.939> in

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
yeah you might find a big difference in

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
yeah you might find a big difference in
your<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:33.450> week<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.110> really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
your first week when you're really

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
your first week when you're really
adjusting<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> new<00:01:35.040> program<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.670> then

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
adjusting to a new program but then

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
adjusting to a new program but then
you're<00:01:35.909> gonna<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.990> putting<00:01:37.290> on

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you're gonna kind of be putting on

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.340 
you're gonna kind of be putting on
muscle<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.310> their<00:01:38.880> fat<00:01:39.479> loss<00:01:39.689> might<00:01:40.049> taper

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
muscle and their fat loss might taper

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.960 
muscle and their fat loss might taper
but<00:01:40.710> you'll<00:01:40.890> still<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.490> seeing<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but you'll still be like seeing a lot of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.569 
but you'll still be like seeing a lot of
results<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.990> probably<00:01:43.320> won't<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.890> 10

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
results but it probably won't be like 10

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.679 
results but it probably won't be like 10
pounds<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.909> births<00:01:45.090> week<00:01:45.240> 10<00:01:45.390> pounds<00:01:45.630> the
