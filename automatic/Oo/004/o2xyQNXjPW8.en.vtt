00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.729
 funny scum looked from the page allies 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.579
 it doesn't matter that they remain of subjects of the years I decide to pass with val 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.679
 tidone their nature doesn't change you can't trust them 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.359
 by now there is no doubt that the news of the arrival of the demons is reached so much 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.060
 peace 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.539
 eat and everything because the other day we let the hands of the demons escape us 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.749
 under the nose 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.960
 now you wish to insinuate that the fault is mine but of course not 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.420
 everyone's responsibility is never good to remember 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.820
 commander 8 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.530

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.390
 you two looked like dargen dude friends 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.980
 there is a treaty of alliance that we have always respected in 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 every occasion you have no right to treat us so treat me like that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.520
 and what we would have ever done to you we feel you are certainly not friendly 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.650
 answer my question you have seen human demons 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.740
 yes, but no longer there are no more abandoned the village 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.770
 to go where 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.800
 it seems obvious to me that you know it 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.840
 you shouldn't do the mysterious ones 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.360
 but as mysterious as I could have wanted to know it, we too had got into it 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.199
 journey to reach it if you thought you could make it on your own 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.560
 since you were so keen on making this journey 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.090
 I think I would have brought something more with me 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.850
 when what we do with these you could snap me sometimes 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.430
 imagine how to cut out 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
