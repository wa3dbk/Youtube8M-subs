00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Jeremy Bentham might give the most 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.150
 here the player afterwards now what fall 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 The psv is mainly has that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.710
 dealing with that 71st minute 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.170
 think so i think it 's a whole 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 important moment in the competition 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 actually a very bad game 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 where I could have helped the team up 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.539
 a head start and that was perhaps 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 necessary erase causing the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.330
 boys would trust more 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.330
 to get 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.820
 yes that in it I am gold without a human being 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.740
 Finally a one to two money to you 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 shoe that just missed one minute 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 later Ajax scored two one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 that football like that and train the other 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 club say yes that makes that action 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.850
 even more painful i think if you are such 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.469
 opportunity missing in you will get another one afterwards 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 second chance it is that the leaf 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.239
 wiping out and now it remains really 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.180
 did we are in your head because yes 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 from the counterattack in the two make it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.629
 agree that the three a win 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.050
 of ajax funnels 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.890
 considering the match, how did that happen? 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.420
 why was ajax better than psv today 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400
 that is precisely that I can 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.340
 tell that we didn't try 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.979
 have to play football that we we 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.259
 have not played with the psv with the met 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 importance build up but i have to say that i 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.979
 still quite a bit of pushing if I could 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.990
 back to and that is not ours 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.539
 power and it's not because of us either 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 qualities as a team and have that 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.780
 we failed to play football tonight 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 circulated back to the land again 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.469
 first half for that the people who do this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.179
 see and hear the jeremain lens 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.890
 was the average website 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.060
 You bring PSV back into the competition 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 the moment that you are completely gone 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.229
 have played the likes 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.619
 yes and then well there you are before her 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.509
 striker omnicol and that's why I think 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 also I that I've failed him just 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.099
 if you are a striker then you must think your team 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.899
 I help by making the goals and that 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:51.929
 that could have been with 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.280
 with that ball that I am next to then I see 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.450
 you almost every week I play football 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.860
 didn't get it at all from the first one 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.539
 half how you are overwhelmed 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.189
 Turner Scott idea that trust 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.479
 the confidence that that is sufficient 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.989
 was present to have a good game here 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959
 play 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:06.179
 yes that's what I thought I just think just 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.610
 like last year we were here 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.280
 yes actually little input that was 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.900
 today certainly in the first half 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.989
 this defeat more painful than that of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.440
 last week against vitesse loss 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.000
 always on also only yes i was like 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.150
 amsterdammer that animals really like 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.470
 want to win and against vitesse you have 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.849
 I think 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.739
 yes a lot of chances is gram 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.540
 so the defeat felt something else 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.680
 today it just feels right 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 defeat which I still think 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.410
 yes the game do that turn around in it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.359
 case with the chance of mine but 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.389
 well that did not work 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.120
 no a funnel deserved defeat yes 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.829
 in a trie a triptych with fc 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.260
 twente follows the first two 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.030
 lost in peize i am a says pc is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.590
 back again when finished 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.109
 we don't have a match what you say 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.440
 against the topper and they have to be there 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.440
 in oh
