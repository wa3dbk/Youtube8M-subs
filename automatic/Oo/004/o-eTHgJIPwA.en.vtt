made<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.050> we<00:04:20.230> could<00:04:20.410> kind<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.830> be<00:04:21.370> a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
made it that we could kind of be a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.130 
made it that we could kind of be a
little<00:04:21.490> bit<00:04:21.700> nonlinear<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.600> storytelling

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
little bit nonlinear in the storytelling

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.790 
little bit nonlinear in the storytelling
and<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.560> think<00:04:23.740> it's<00:04:23.830> really<00:04:23.980> effective<00:04:24.490> I

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.050 

really<00:04:29.800> feel<00:04:29.980> by<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.250> end<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> movie<00:04:30.850> that

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
really feel by the end of the movie that

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.180 
really feel by the end of the movie that
it's<00:04:31.300> about<00:04:31.570> transcending<00:04:32.500> his<00:04:32.710> need<00:04:32.980> to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
it's about transcending his need to

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.820 
it's about transcending his need to
identify<00:04:33.820> himself<00:04:34.090> with<00:04:34.690> all<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.620> this

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
identify himself with all of this

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.300 
identify himself with all of this
outside<00:04:36.190> stuff<00:04:36.850> which<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.780> think<00:04:38.140> again<00:04:38.980> brings

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
outside stuff which I think again brings

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.950 
outside stuff which I think again brings
him<00:04:39.490> back<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.820> cooler<00:04:40.210> version<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.660> who<00:04:40.810> he

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
him back to a cooler version of who he

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.830 
him back to a cooler version of who he
was<00:04:41.170> when<00:04:42.040> we<00:04:42.220> met<00:04:42.400> him<00:04:42.550> five<00:04:42.760> years<00:04:43.000> ago<00:04:43.210> how

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
was when we met him five years ago how

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.790 
was when we met him five years ago how
many<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.170> air<00:04:44.260> Jarvis<00:04:44.620> 13
