my favourite survival technique is to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.310 
my favourite survival technique is to
ensure<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.290> keep<00:02:04.500> breathing<00:02:05.180> in

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320

the balls I will keep breathing and I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.509 
the balls I will keep breathing and I
think<00:02:11.439> I'll<00:02:11.620> probably<00:02:11.890> make<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.250> put<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
think I'll probably make it put it

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.179 
think I'll probably make it put it
throughout<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.379> journey<00:02:14.379> there<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.010> one

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189
