these spiders are actually there but you
can<00:01:48.030> certainly<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:49.220> they<00:01:50.220> hang<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.670> their

webs and to put it in perspective we
have<00:01:55.259> 640<00:01:56.159> species<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> spider<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> UK<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
have 640 species of spider in the UK and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
have 640 species of spider in the UK and
only<00:01:58.110> 12<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.619> been<00:01:58.649> documented<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.369> biting

only 12 have been documented as biting

if<00:02:00.499> anybody<00:02:01.310> sees<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.640> spider<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.359> they<00:02:02.450> don't

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
if anybody sees a spider that they don't

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.989 
if anybody sees a spider that they don't
recognize<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.890> likelihood<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.549> that<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.850> will

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
recognize the likelihood is that it will

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.779 
recognize the likelihood is that it will
be<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.359> common<00:02:05.810> British<00:02:06.109> spider<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:07.640> that

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
be a common British spider and so that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.639 
be a common British spider and so that
outside<00:02:08.239> Chancellor<00:02:08.840> will<00:02:08.959> be<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.379> steer

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
outside Chancellor will be the steer

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.979 
outside Chancellor will be the steer
toad<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> spider<00:02:10.340> or<00:02:10.879> stiff<00:02:11.510> had<00:02:11.660> an<00:02:11.780> ability

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
toad a spider or stiff had an ability

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.320 
toad a spider or stiff had an ability
and<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:13.040> most<00:02:13.400> likely<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> moment<00:02:14.239> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and it's most likely the moment that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
and it's most likely the moment that
that's<00:02:14.510> only<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.049> be<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.470> extremes<00:02:15.980> down

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that's only going to be in extremes down

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.750 
that's only going to be in extremes down
from<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.549> UK<00:02:16.879> anyway
