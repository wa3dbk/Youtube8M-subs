00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
so I don't know exactly which ones yet

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.400 
so I don't know exactly which ones yet
depends<00:02:02.150> on<00:02:02.330> how<00:02:02.540> many<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.810> each<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.200> what

exactly<00:02:03.560> our<00:02:03.980> holo<00:02:04.190> pools<00:02:04.520> are<00:02:04.730> if<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.270> make<00:02:05.720> a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
exactly our holo pools are if I make a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.420 
exactly our holo pools are if I make a
good<00:02:05.930> amount<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.260> money<00:02:06.440> then<00:02:06.710> I'll<00:02:07.340> probably

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
good amount of money then I'll probably

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.820 
good amount of money then I'll probably
keep<00:02:07.760> more<00:02:08.060> than<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:09.200> know<00:02:09.320> if<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:09.530> don't<00:02:09.710> make

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
keep more than you know if we don't make

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.200 
keep more than you know if we don't make
a<00:02:09.860> lot<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:11.450> aside<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:13.310> only<00:02:13.580> one<00:02:13.730> hollow<00:02:13.940> so

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
a lot that aside and only one hollow so

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.290 
a lot that aside and only one hollow so
far<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.480> kind<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.590> bit<00:02:15.710> wack<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
far that's kind of a little bit wack and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.980 
far that's kind of a little bit wack and
still<00:02:17.960> just<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.670> that's<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:20.420> three<00:02:20.750> four

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
still just one that's one two three four

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.500 
still just one that's one two three four
five<00:02:21.050> six<00:02:21.350> seven<00:02:22.040> packs<00:02:22.460> in<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.240> hollow<00:02:24.280> us

five six seven packs in one hollow us

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.360 
five six seven packs in one hollow us
this<00:02:26.510> means<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.900> all<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.010> hollows<00:02:28.190> are

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
this means that all the hollows are

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
this means that all the hollows are
going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> show<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.880> at<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> end<00:02:29.300> at<00:02:29.600> least
