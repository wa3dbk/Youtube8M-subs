00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to everyone all with you again index 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.820
 Today I wanted to talk a little bit about 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.309
 how can it be roll in dota 2 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.530
 So what we need to do to us 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 you will need ram years lo capo 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.680
 and here it is my from here until creeps for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.350
 well done mane and what are we doing next 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 we become to learn first we 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.119
 we become under one tower let it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 will break fall but for now only under 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.600
 one night try to shave everything now 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 which one 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 already a hundred and here we turn on yes we have 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 efficiency rises and here we have beats beats 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.559
 watchtower and here we again we have time 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.340
 have time again and we have time 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.320
 5 so as not to die 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.120
 we just live without a cooldown and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.159
 so we survive how can it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.130
 use fights but if you are you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 pick up a little bit then you can 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 sell this brawl and they won't kill you 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.259
 the main thing is to calculate the quantity 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.159
 opponent and you will succeed here at 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 us up to 400 hp is brought 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 our health as soon as something 1 and here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.380
 home look at the last butting so that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 it came to you 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 javit aroma or from some creep 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.189
 don't be the same you can die with me 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.220
 No, it was not so often while I was studying and so 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.680
 what are we learning to do next when you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.820
 already sure that we learned from one 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 towers then you can come up to two came out 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.299
 but I do not advise you to do this yet if you 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.130
 just start learning try 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.380
 moo on one tower and then on goal 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.939
 then get here and hit you 3 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 towers you will need to really so what 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.430
 study for now only on 1 and then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 on 2 why can you teach an omelet 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.289
 because when we activated it 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.819
 gives for 400 units and 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.069
 at the same time we have lost when and 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.349
 from him we cannot fester in any way 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.599
 so here we can him as 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.599
 connect and we are not from him 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.970
 we ask ourselves at all so it is very 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.829
 helps 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.930
 situations give catch up and you want 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.470
 run away from another person you just 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.489
 always turn on and activate like that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.069
 here's a quick omelet switch so he 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:48.299
 you did not catch up with power show 5 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:53.510
 drops there crap at all unreal 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:58.970
 put here in general fit under the tower 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 turn on armlet that's how we trained 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:08.870
 turn off again including smoothly but 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.870
 poke until you find and you will not die 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.340

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.849
