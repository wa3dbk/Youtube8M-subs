so I'll I'll teach you the basics I'll
go<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:26.240> deck<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:28.159> about

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
go from there so deck like this about

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
go from there so deck like this about
third<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> deck<00:01:29.939> start<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.750> I'd<00:01:30.960> say

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
third of the deck start off with I'd say

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.539 
third of the deck start off with I'd say
and<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> put<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.520> thumb

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and you're going to put your thumb

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
and you're going to put your thumb
across<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> back

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
across it just like that and on the back

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
across it just like that and on the back
you<00:01:36.049> can't<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> good<00:01:37.619> you're<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you can't really get a good you're on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.149 
you can't really get a good you're on
your<00:01:38.490> index<00:01:38.790> index<00:01:39.329> finger<00:01:39.720> curled<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:41.009> right

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
your index index finger curled all right

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.499 
your index index finger curled all right
like<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.240> rest<00:01:42.390> your

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
like that so you have all the rest your

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.929 
like that so you have all the rest your
fingers<00:01:42.780> curled<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> back<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
fingers curled on the back like that and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
fingers curled on the back like that and
basically<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.270> you're<00:01:45.420> doing<00:01:45.659> thumb<00:01:46.619> stays

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
basically all you're doing thumb stays

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
basically all you're doing thumb stays
put<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.570> bad<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
put is a really bad one but the the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
put is a really bad one but the the
fingers<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> back<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
fingers on the back are just kind of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.780 
fingers on the back are just kind of
extending<00:01:53.430> around<00:01:55.340> okay<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
extending around okay so from the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
are kind of pulling the cards around

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.180 
are kind of pulling the cards around
that<00:02:22.990> makes<00:02:23.140> sense<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.440> my<00:02:23.530> head<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.860> hopefully

so yeah the thumb does that move it is
all<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> index<00:02:30.610> finger<00:02:30.910> right<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
all in the index finger right here and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.140 
all in the index finger right here and
you're<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.740> uncurl<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.670> kind

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
hopefully I can get a part of the deck

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.850 
hopefully I can get a part of the deck
that<00:02:43.870> doesn't<00:02:44.200> stick<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.820> okay<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that doesn't stick up like that okay and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.830 
that doesn't stick up like that okay and
it's<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:51.790> cool<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.630> little

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840

flourish<00:02:53.080> once<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.830> down<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:55.510> just

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
flourish once you get it down I can just

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.990 
flourish once you get it down I can just
throw<00:02:56.530> out<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.830> entire<00:02:57.100> trick<00:02:57.550> just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.890 
showing off I need to kind of flourish
little<00:02:59.920> thing<00:03:00.210> it's<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.240> really<00:03:01.510> neat<00:03:01.660> little

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
little thing it's a really neat little

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.800 
little thing it's a really neat little
move<00:03:02.020> but<00:03:02.350> that's<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:03.100> all<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.820> teach

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
move but that's really all I can teach

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.070 
move but that's really all I can teach
you<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:07.020> start<00:03:08.020> off<00:03:08.170> with<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> couple<00:03:08.650> pointers

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
you to start off with a couple pointers

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.880 
you to start off with a couple pointers
about<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.560> guess<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.230> deck<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.800> you're

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
about it I guess the deck that you're

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.860 
about it I guess the deck that you're
using<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:15.850> important<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.720> be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
using and it is important you have to be

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.920 
using and it is important you have to be
able<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.050> do<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> regular<00:03:17.350> fan<00:03:17.709> with<00:03:17.860> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
able to do a regular fan with it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.180 
able to do a regular fan with it
obviously<00:03:19.930> because<00:03:20.290> if<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.530> deck<00:03:20.680> won't<00:03:20.860> fan

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
obviously because if the deck won't fan

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.160 
obviously because if the deck won't fan
then<00:03:21.520> this<00:03:21.700> move<00:03:21.910> will<00:03:22.209> not<00:03:22.239> happen<00:03:23.130> um<00:03:25.170> let's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
then this move will not happen um let's

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.729 
then this move will not happen um let's
see<00:03:26.500> what<00:03:26.530> else<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.020> feel<00:03:29.500> like<00:03:29.590> got

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
see what else yeah I feel like got

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.870 
see what else yeah I feel like got
nothing<00:03:29.980> else<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:30.280> about<00:03:30.520> all<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.850> can

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
showing it over and over again from the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.330 
showing it over and over again from the
exposed<00:03:37.870> view<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.440> I've<00:03:41.860> said<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.130> like<00:03:42.280> four

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000 
exposed view so I've said this like four
times<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.560> uncurling<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.739> index

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
times and just uncurling the index

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.910 
times and just uncurling the index
finger<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.550> using<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.000> rest<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.390> fingers
