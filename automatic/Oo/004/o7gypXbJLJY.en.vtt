00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.390
 hey I am today I show you mine 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.390
 self-built ultralight emergency stove 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.119
 the whole almost always loose cup 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.770
 and now I'll put the burner on 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.960
 that you discover that is a normal one 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.449
 Canned food will cover me later 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.400
 to cover the cup with it as possible 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 little energy always escapes 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.019
 important for such small cooking because 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 otherwise not much power comes out then 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:44.839
 my coach just that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.839
 A cosmetics box is the screw bar 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:53.460
 and it was fuel paste in it 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:59.220
 That's about 50 milliliters of content now 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 my windbreak this is a histo itself 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.760
 removed the lid and the floor 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 while the cut further to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110
 so we changed in diameter 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.250
 and besides, this will open then 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 also pure air and then I still have 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.820
 here 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.200
 three such pictures hook the pictures 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.509
 I have something up here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.409
 so I put that into the people 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.729
 hang and have the hook here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 I just turned to the other side 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.329
 usually the occasion is bent 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.460
 So I put my nose on it 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.869
 I can get started before I start 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.759
 important note to the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.210
 cut open box of course I have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.560
 all edges here with a file 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 celebrated around so we made 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.039
 nothing more sharp-edged it stays over 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.670
 you can not see yourself here anymore 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.100
 hurt 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.640
 first pending the pictures hook on 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.640
 windbreak 1 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 then I find the coach to the protection 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:12.150
 create it and cover it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 is pretty windy today perfect 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.709
 conditions for the test of my body 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.299
 in that the system of the cooker 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.209
 decoupled, nothing happens 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.069
 The cup accidentally knocks 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.640
 you see the cook stops there 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.640
 nothing happens 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.329
 You should not do one thing only 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.000
 namely to take the windbreak 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.540
 he gets so hot that he burns you 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 paws off 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.620
 then blow the cooker out 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.459
 a 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.320
 By the way, the whole system weighs in 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.340
 full burner and with cup just 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.340
 180 grams 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.480
 By the way, the small burner is enough 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.600
 and two cups of tea to heat up or 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.200
 two small cans of feed 400 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.940
 milliliter 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.950
 That means that personally enough for me 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.240
 I'm not on the road for a day 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.080
 I'll just take another dose 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.970
 More with so find once again away 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.560
 then you'll look good 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.560
 and until next time ciao
