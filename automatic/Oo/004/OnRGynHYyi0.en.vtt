00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.419
 the question selected has been the 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.580
 vanessa vanessa Vigo Galician Mengot 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.379
 I wanted to know how many times you should apply 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.360
 the pipette when there is contact 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.760
 frequent between the puppy and the water 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.560
 for example when your dog bathes in 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.440
 the beach or when she bathes him at home 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.770
 vanessa's dog is called star and is 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.360
 a Maltese bichon four months 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.460
 advanced tics is distributed through 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.280
 the lipid layer that is the fatty tissue 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.500
 of the animal's skin so that it 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.440
 achieves significant resistance to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.379
 water so vanessa you can bathe astro 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.719
 without problems the atlantis studies 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.789
 show that a weekly investment of 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.089
 our pet in the water does not affect the 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.499
 effectiveness of the product however if the 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.199
 you put to the water with a frequency 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.829
 superior its effectiveness can be seen 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.809
 reduced 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.030
 It is recommended that you go to your dog 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.030
 before the application of advanced tics 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.429
 and that the axes correctly even if 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.979
 this was not possible the effectiveness of the 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.290
 pipettes would remain however 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.020
 vanessa we recommend that once 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.140
 apply the pipette wait 24 hours 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.149
 before bathing your dog on the other hand 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.039
 tics advanced studies have 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.189
 demonstrated that a bath a month with shampoo 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.810
 does not affect the effectiveness of the product 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.939
 I take this opportunity to remind you that the bathrooms 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 with shampoo should be with a product 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.390
 Suitable for dogs the use of other 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.190
 Shampoo class can vary its ph 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.470
 remember vanessa that from atlantic 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 We always recommend consulting a 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.380
 vet 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.569
