00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
happy I think I cut one side but once I

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.650 
happy I think I cut one side but once I
was<00:05:00.070> shorter<00:05:00.580> than<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:00.820> other<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.420> then<00:05:01.570> I

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
was shorter than the other so then I

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.480

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
tried to even it by cutting the other

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.350 
tried to even it by cutting the other
side<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:05.310> did<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.340> lot<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.610> cutting<00:05:06.940> too<00:05:07.330> much
