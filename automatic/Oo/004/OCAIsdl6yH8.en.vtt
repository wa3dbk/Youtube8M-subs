playing in this kind of way it's quite

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.059 
playing in this kind of way it's quite
easily<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.180> afro<00:03:02.780> c4<00:03:03.319> around<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.709> corner

and<00:03:04.159> take<00:03:04.310> them<00:03:04.549> out<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:04.879> even<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:05.269> throw<00:03:05.599> a

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
and take them out or even just throw a

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.110 
and take them out or even just throw a
flashbang<00:03:08.169> and<00:03:09.220> there's<00:03:10.220> my<00:03:10.400> first<00:03:10.639> VSAT

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
flashbang and there's my first VSAT

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.390 
flashbang and there's my first VSAT
right<00:03:11.359> there<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.200> be<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.680> huge

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
right there this is going to be a huge

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.360 
right there this is going to be a huge
game-changer<00:03:13.669> now<00:03:14.329> once<00:03:15.139> you<00:03:15.409> hit<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.859> visa

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
game-changer now once you hit the visa

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.030 
game-changer now once you hit the visa
is<00:03:16.609> time<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.209> start<00:03:17.540> switching<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.709> your

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
is time to start switching up your

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.869 
is time to start switching up your
positions

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
positions

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.759 
positions
you<00:03:20.510> obviously<00:03:21.109> know<00:03:21.260> where<00:03:21.440> they're<00:03:21.620> coming

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
you obviously know where they're coming

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.409 
you obviously know where they're coming
from<00:03:22.069> so<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.519> game<00:03:22.699> becomes<00:03:23.060> ten<00:03:23.389> times

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
from so the game becomes ten times

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.550 
from so the game becomes ten times
easier<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:25.569> this<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.750> where<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.959> sort<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.319> take

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
easier and this is where I sort of take

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.129 
easier and this is where I sort of take
over<00:03:27.859> this<00:03:27.979> club<00:03:28.340> area<00:03:28.699> here<00:03:29.000> I'm<00:03:29.780> going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.019> be

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
over this club area here I'm going to be

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.719 
over this club area here I'm going to be
used<00:03:30.349> in<00:03:30.440> bouncing<00:03:30.829> bears<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.220> cover<00:03:31.430> off<00:03:31.579> the

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
used in bouncing bears to cover off the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.080 
used in bouncing bears to cover off the
entrances<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.479> I<00:03:33.169> like<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.979> bouncing<00:03:34.699> betty<00:03:34.819> on

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
entrances and I like a bouncing betty on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.449 
entrances and I like a bouncing betty on
two<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.079> entrances<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.919> I'll<00:03:37.099> be<00:03:37.220> facing

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
two of the entrances and I'll be facing

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.530 
two of the entrances and I'll be facing
and<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:39.109> third<00:03:39.290> entrance<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.760> could<00:03:44.419> have

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and the third entrance so I could have

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.270 
and the third entrance so I could have
easily<00:03:44.780> just<00:03:45.079> ran<00:03:45.470> around<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.829> map<00:03:45.979> while<00:03:46.159> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
easily just ran around the map while the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.789 
easily just ran around the map while the
visa<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.790> up<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.239> I<00:03:47.479> want<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.169> keep<00:03:48.349> hold<00:03:48.650> of

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
visa is up but I want to keep hold of

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.800 
visa is up but I want to keep hold of
this<00:03:49.010> sort<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.489> area<00:03:49.790> just<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.389> case<00:03:50.540> someone

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
this sort of area just in case someone

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.069 
this sort of area just in case someone
does<00:03:51.139> spawn<00:03:51.979> behind<00:03:52.940> me<00:03:53.299> later<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.720> when<00:03:54.049> I

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.090 
gameplay I'm gonna be talking about what
I<00:07:18.060> think<00:07:18.150> are<00:07:18.600> the<00:07:18.900> balance<00:07:19.380> issues<00:07:19.919> in

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
I think are the balance issues in

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.250 
I think are the balance issues in
regards<00:07:20.430> to<00:07:20.460> kill<00:07:20.700> streaks<00:07:21.030> in<00:07:21.300> ecology<00:07:21.870> at

regards to kill streaks in ecology at

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.890 
regards to kill streaks in ecology at
the<00:07:22.410> moment<00:07:22.919> and<00:07:23.130> I<00:07:23.580> think<00:07:23.790> this<00:07:23.900> discussion

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
the moment and I think this discussion

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.510 
the moment and I think this discussion
is<00:07:25.020> important<00:07:25.530> to<00:07:25.590> be<00:07:25.710> had<00:07:25.890> because<00:07:26.100> we<00:07:26.400> have

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
is important to be had because we have

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.450 
is important to be had because we have
ecology<00:07:27.060> egos<00:07:27.330> coming<00:07:27.690> up<00:07:27.810> and<00:07:28.260> I<00:07:28.860> hope<00:07:29.220> that

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
ecology egos coming up and I hope that

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.440 
ecology egos coming up and I hope that
the<00:07:30.150> game<00:07:31.130> itself<00:07:32.130> is<00:07:32.400> criticized<00:07:32.850> a<00:07:32.880> lot<00:07:33.240> more

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450 
the game itself is criticized a lot more

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.870 
the game itself is criticized a lot more
before<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:34.560> next<00:07:34.740> game<00:07:34.889> arrives<00:07:35.400> otherwise

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 
before the next game arrives otherwise

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.909 
before the next game arrives otherwise
we<00:07:36.150> could<00:07:36.330> once<00:07:36.660> again<00:07:36.870> see<00:07:37.080> things<00:07:37.650> that

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 
we could once again see things that

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.070 
we could once again see things that
clearly<00:07:38.250> overpowered<00:07:38.880> and<00:07:39.120> issues<00:07:39.570> that<00:07:39.600> need

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
clearly overpowered and issues that need

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.409 
clearly overpowered and issues that need
to<00:07:40.320> be<00:07:40.350> addressed<00:07:40.800> but<00:07:41.790> that's<00:07:41.970> gonna<00:07:42.120> be<00:07:42.240> so

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 
to be addressed but that's gonna be so

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.330 
to be addressed but that's gonna be so
my<00:07:42.600> opinion<00:07:43.080> on<00:07:43.200> that<00:07:43.350> so<00:07:43.650> I'm<00:07:43.860> not<00:07:43.890> sure<00:07:44.070> if

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 
my opinion on that so I'm not sure if

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.940 
my opinion on that so I'm not sure if
