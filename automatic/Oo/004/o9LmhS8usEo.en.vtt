00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello very good here we are 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:15.490
 let's get your hard and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 sugarland is the one that went his way 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.570
 in two in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.939
 the forward variables and the then 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 To achieve this, we must come to the USA 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.360
 to scrapping is as good as above and if 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 in the ball machine is with the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.850
 yellow arrows 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 I was talking I was lucky enough to come out 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 to leave at this time 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 OK no 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.840
 and while a little more throat 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.650
 He said that they should not say it out 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.330
 better costs a bit is something because 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.260
 Sometimes there are so many players coming out that 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.780
 it's complicated 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 if you have luck time to leave soon 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.390
 all good luck 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.390
 wake and that he has left me because thing 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.730
 and it reads from the raymond leaves in states 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.730
 United 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.560
 I guess you put the video and 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 here we are 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.930
 because I fear eric and the next eric 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.040
 I do not have the raymond eric 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.040
 in the world 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.030
 then he is in the world cup that is 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.030
 here that is this 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.390
 that much better in the world than one 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.909
 at least for me I do not know what techniques 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 I learned from the other 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.380
 sometimes not leave the u 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.409
 by nature music faith 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.890
 nothing normally no player comes out 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.440
 well up to here there was not nor does it seem that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.200
 comes out especially I think it was 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.190
 that there is colossal in normally 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.190
 more players look to see 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 I like these lines 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 nothing yet 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.570
 neither fuck what are 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.590
 although we are a little bit that will take its 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.800
 because it will not come out 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.319
 to the first clear is if you use the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.590
 first is that you are very lucky all 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.590
 It depends 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 No, nothing 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.880
 here is your set 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:08.090
 heartland that was good hopefully we repeat 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.090
 and let's see what techniques I hope 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.030
 I loved it benjamÃ­n Sunday 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.720
 Well, we've gotten her daughter there 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.410
 the couple go 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 Let's see 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.960
 28 is 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 the fact of rose and butterfly dance 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.110
 I expected and will surely learn what bounced 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.100
 hangover 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.940
 and here technique dribble 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940
 Well I'm not but 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.380
 good data and to taste the video like this is 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.000
 how you usually get it 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.190
 will get if all the players should 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.700
 form elements that can be achieved 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.700
 I do not know for example 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.590
 hayden frost sound flowers but the led 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.090
 with the power with the air form then 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.270
 Frost used with scarf or whether 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.420
 I wear that is this summer be here 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.080
 OK 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.080
 for example 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.389
 and how to get sound and nothing is 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.570
 Well, I like to like 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.880
 Faustus subscribe and comment pasaros 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.860
