00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
you on how you make a redstone alarm

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.089 
you on how you make a redstone alarm
system<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> first<00:00:07.440> things<00:00:07.680> you'll<00:00:07.890> need

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
system so the first things you'll need

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.039 
system so the first things you'll need
is<00:00:08.309> redstone<00:00:09.260> redstone<00:00:10.260> torches<00:00:11.900> anything<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
is redstone redstone torches anything to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259 
is redstone redstone torches anything to
put<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> redstone<00:00:13.500> torches<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.370> cobblestone

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
put the redstone torches on cobblestone

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.300 
put the redstone torches on cobblestone
whatever<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.400> button<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.600> pressure<00:00:18.990> plate

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
whatever a button and a pressure plate

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.500 
whatever a button and a pressure plate
so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.850> we're<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.359> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
so the first thing we're going to do is
make<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> 5<00:00:22.140> o'clock<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.010> place<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.699> block

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
make a 5 o'clock so place one block

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.529 
make a 5 o'clock so place one block
there<00:00:24.470> one<00:00:25.470> block<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.670> block<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.210> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
there one block there one block there so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.279 
there one block there one block there so
three<00:00:28.080> blocks<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.740> two<00:00:29.220> space<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.730> between

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
three blocks with two space in between

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.340 
three blocks with two space in between
good<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.110> place

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
good so then go to here and then place

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.100 
good so then go to here and then place
one<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.420> place<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
one there and place one there so it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.160 
one there and place one there so it
should<00:00:37.290> look<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.510> then<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.960> redstone

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
should look like that then put redstone

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.290 
should look like that then put redstone
on<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.840> there<00:00:43.370> there<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> there

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
on that one there there there and there

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
on that one there there there and there
then<00:00:48.300> connect<00:00:48.750> them<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> should

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
then connect them all up and it should

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.369 
then connect them all up and it should
look<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.500> this<00:01:02.570> okay<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> next<00:01:03.960> thing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
look like this okay now the next thing

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.060 
look like this okay now the next thing
is<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.949> RS<00:01:05.430> nor<00:01:05.820> latch<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.979> when<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
is the RS nor latch which is when you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
is the RS nor latch which is when you
press<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> button<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.479> stay<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.260> or

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
press in the button it will stay on or

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.820 
press in the button it will stay on or
whatever<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.179 

alright<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.369> which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:19.979> up

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
alright there's that which is we go up

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
alright there's that which is we go up
again<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.630> say<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> block<00:01:22.710> their

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
again so just say just to block their

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
again so just say just to block their
redstone<00:01:23.540> block<00:01:24.540> their<00:01:24.780> redstone<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> then

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
redstone block their redstone and then

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.230 
redstone block their redstone and then
it<00:01:26.070> connects<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.670> together<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it connects all together then make a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
it connects all together then make a
repeater<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.979> they're

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
repeater I think that's what they're

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130 
repeater I think that's what they're
called<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.420> place<00:01:33.659> two<00:01:33.960> blocks

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
called I don't know so place two blocks

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.210 
called I don't know so place two blocks
redstone<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.460> end<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.439> redstone<00:01:37.439> there

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
redstone on one end and redstone there

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.300 
redstone on one end and redstone there
or<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:41.030> connect<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> then

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
or on there connect it there and then

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.630 
or on there connect it there and then
join<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.149> clock<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.340> join

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
join it into the clock and then join

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
join it into the clock and then join
that<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.399> thing<00:01:50.460> here

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that up to it and what this thing here

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
that up to it and what this thing here
does<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.329> stop<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.140> signal<00:01:52.380> coming

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
does is stop it from this signal coming

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.380 
does is stop it from this signal coming
back<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> changing<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:55.670> now<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> want

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
back and changing this now what you want

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
back and changing this now what you want
to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> put<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> button<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.799> which<00:01:59.189> will

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to do is put the button there which will

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 
to do is put the button there which will
be<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> reset<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> press<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> will

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
be the reset when you press it it will

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.480 
be the reset when you press it it will
stop<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.790> circuit<00:02:03.299> from<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.490> then

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
stop this circuit from going on and then

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.819 
stop this circuit from going on and then
all<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> add<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> redstone<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
all you have to do is add a redstone to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.180 
all you have to do is add a redstone to
it<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.849> RS<00:02:09.720> nor<00:02:09.929> latch<00:02:09.989> where<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.590> off<00:02:10.739> on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it to the RS nor latch where it's off on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.170 
it to the RS nor latch where it's off on
the<00:02:11.340> reset<00:02:11.760> state

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
the reset state

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.330 
the reset state
and<00:02:13.720> make<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:13.959> go<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.319> pressure<00:02:14.650> plate<00:02:14.920> like

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and make it go to a pressure plate like

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.039 
and make it go to a pressure plate like
if<00:02:15.519> it's<00:02:15.640> down<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.879> corridor<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.689> you're<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.959> a

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
if it's down a corridor and you're in a

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.309 
if it's down a corridor and you're in a
different<00:02:17.379> place<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.709> your<00:02:17.829> house<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:19.319> really

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
different place of your house and really

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.750 
different place of your house and really
that<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.099> alarm<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.739> hit<00:02:24.579> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that is the alarm now when you hit the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.420 
that is the alarm now when you hit the
pressure<00:02:25.030> plate<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:26.620> should<00:02:26.920> make<00:02:27.220> these

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
pressure plate it should make these
