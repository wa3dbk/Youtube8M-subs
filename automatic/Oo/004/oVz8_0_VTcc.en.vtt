 when the vegetables are cut and they enter 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.539
 in contact with the air they adopt a color 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.039
 dark they lose the flavor or even 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.439
 your content can be modified 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.850
 nutritional spent a few minutes imagines 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.740
 how many properties will you have lost the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 cabbage with which preparing food 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
 Quick favorite at the dog stand 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 most of the vegetables that you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 added to your order are in contact 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.710
 direct with the agents that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 they find in the environment in addition to this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.669
 the highs also lose many of their 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.109
 nutrients to be in the interperie the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 foods come into contact with 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.039
 different pollutants during 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.199
 the day at the end of the working day 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.300
 It is likely that several of them have not 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.909
 been used in its entirety you have 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.979
 asked what they do with them not all 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.690
 the sauces are compared because the 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.460
 health and the mayor allows us to put 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.879
 homemade sauces or any type of sauce 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.859
 we prepare them ourselves 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.409
 we prepare some with 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.789
 especially without these about that 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.789
 we prepare them ourselves 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 we grab a glass that we already have 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.150
 us a special glass us 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.570
 we mix first what is the envelope of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.870
 cheese or equipment 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.090
 and then we win and we throw it with him 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.570
 a single glass was assembled we prepared the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.340
 cheese or bacon lime the origin of 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.050
 the vegetables is uncertain we can not 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.510
 corroborate that they are fresh or of what 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.040
 way have been manipulated at least 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.570
 the avocado the tomato the onion the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.729
 cheese all that brings it minced and in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.740
 tacit to be able every day 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.330
 change them and work with that the only thing 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.369
 they explain it is cheese and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.840
 avocado that is the only thing that stings because 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.780
 and everything else comes from home and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 I am in it as it already comes in stock 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.920
 I bring the others here the merchandise 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.390
 and we buy those who manage 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.820
 Foods must meet requirements 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.300
 that demand health with systems that 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.550
 these sellers we grabbed it we grabbed it 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.710
 we all collect everything where is the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.930
 we put it in a bag of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 garbage ready button if we have not 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.560
 saved from today for tomorrow because 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.840
 for tomorrow it did not work because really 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.789
 does not work anymore the cabbage has a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 certain limit because you put on the day that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.630
 they deliver it to you and it is already black in the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 late already when salsa turns black and there's 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.290
 that throwing it out the other day has been used 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.700
 health gives us a course 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 food handling and every year 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.459
 we have 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 certified to the ear to speak the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.980
 teaching of life because how they are manipulated 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.709
 the food and how it should be handled 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.970
 all in a talk about how to grab each 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.290
 product that one has to be 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.780
 preparing daily every day 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
 how to chop the avocado that what 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.069
 here the tomato that one has to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.030
 grab glove has to be at each 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.799
 while manipulating the food but it is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.870
 cleanly with the nails cut a 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.640
 knife that this neat that you 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.700
 You also do not want to bite 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.549
 avocado and noja clean the knife and go 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.079
 to cut the tomato according to estimates 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.000
 of the department of health and services 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.459
 human the united states exist around 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.930
 250 different diseases that have 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.849
 its origin in the consumption of food 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.129
 decomposed or contaminated 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.599
 the recommendation is to visualize all the 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.610
 elements that make up the car 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.680
 hot dogs and choose the ones that 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.510
 see more neat also see what 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.790
 way they manipulate food before 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.230
 place the order the health has 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.870
 different meanings for each 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.269
 person needs time and reflection 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.549
 to clarify what is for you since you are 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.569
 willing to give up however is 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.730
 clear that invest 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.590
 health will have positive results for 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.280
 the rest of your life and now the bathrobe
