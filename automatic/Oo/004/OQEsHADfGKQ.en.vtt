00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.620
 she was on the sidewalk when you need to unite everyone and when 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.639
 exist with it you can start to mount a marquee bin will make a 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.549
 table as you get to set up something new 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.730
 you start 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.880
 with one dead 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.090
 it's actually a call back around the river 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 after you make a turn of the river the function of it is not 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.560
 really tighten 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.119
 this this junction 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.020
 it's just start 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.270
 the brand 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.040
 you start to pass the rope always in the same direction always in the same direction 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.660
 taking care not to twist the rope because it will disturb you 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 but forwards what you have pair and killing your mark 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.980
 so after you pass a lot in the same direction 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.960
 different from that observed in the same 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.590
 here is not the case 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590
 I'm going 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 always out 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 your start to pass 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 agreed on 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.270
 otherwise i passed 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.960
 in the vertical now I will start to pass in the poule in the place I went vertical 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.330
 for the course to pass horizontally 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.560
 according to the position here when making samarco now you go 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.080
 also pass quite often 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 in the same direction 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.980
 some people 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.070
 already did this procedure 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.240
 make the same stop 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.740
 date / broken is not the actual procedure 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.150
 the bar now a reality 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.500
 it was not meant for the arts not to do so if they were static in the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.980
 truth for the poem not to run for the other 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.830
 so after you 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.950
 passed on 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.689
 several times in the same direction you can in sawing your brand with which 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.670
 again you can use 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.240
 I sleep right 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.389
 to complete the bar 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.339
 or you can also buy 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.489
 here a made right or you can end your brand 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.189
 with another type of new for example you can make the return of the faithful 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:27.239
 it will also look good printed will stay safe can not stain your 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.209
 August mark
