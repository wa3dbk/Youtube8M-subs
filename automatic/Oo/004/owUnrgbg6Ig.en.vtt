think that a person raising a hand over
their<00:00:56.940> head<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> threat

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
they have to be really careful if you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
they have to be really careful if you
can<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> wanted<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.559> play<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.949> game

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
can get if you wanted to play that game

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
can get if you wanted to play that game
then<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> teach<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> pet<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> love

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
then you need to teach the pet to love

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.539 
then you need to teach the pet to love
ice<00:01:03.989> cubes<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> love<00:01:04.739> getting<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.309> dropped

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
ice cubes and love getting them dropped

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
ice cubes and love getting them dropped
one<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.479> say<00:01:06.630> wow<00:01:06.780> treats<00:01:07.200> are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one at a time so they say wow treats are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
one at a time so they say wow treats are
coming<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> sky<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.060> overall

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
coming from the sky but I think overall

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
coming from the sky but I think overall
it's<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.170> likely<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> most<00:01:11.040> pets<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.490> going

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it's not likely that most pets are going

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's not likely that most pets are going
to<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.880> shrug<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.390> though<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.810> was

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to just shrug it off and though that was

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310 
to just shrug it off and though that was
