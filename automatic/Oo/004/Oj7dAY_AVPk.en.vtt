00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone with you paul and today i 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.160
 I want to show you Easter eggs from gta 5 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.980
 Easter egg, very important for me, because 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.110
 that she is a reference to the film 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 old people do not belong here or old people here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 not the place that is differently called from 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.980
 the film but the bottom line is that this film is my 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.779
 favorite and this is completely random and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 the event that is you are driving on the map and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.609
 see that your enemies are so well that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 have a start with red dots you 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 come and they are all dead i mean 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 dead dogs 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.500
 these are the jeeps standing right on 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 movie old people do not belong here and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.809
 actually nothing 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.570
 interesting before but in fact there is not 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.460
 still not so simple is this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 Easter eggs here do not know how you have it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 the game will appear something completely random 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.219
 and the event that is possible but will appear 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 you a little bit elsewhere 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 but I got this and I dad 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.469
 I went here in general, then everything is about how 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.199
 in the film that is, lie on the dog 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.510
 people are shot and stuff like that i remember 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.820
 that in the film then one man was lying 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 away and he will have a suitcase of money 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 there is also the protagonist of the film came up and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 he said he did not take the money there you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 there will be problems actually here too 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.270
 see the thing here it is a suitcase and here it is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.729
 does not say and now you will die that is 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.189
 see me added 25,000 of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.710
 actually separate here dude lies 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.890
 just like in the movie and it seems that everything is yes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 I succeeded and I got 25,000 urai 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 rich everything and you can leave to leave 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 go home spend it there don't know 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 buy anything there to do tatoo 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 cut one's arms into chaos and so on 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 there plunder caravans anything 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.079
 in fact, the most difficult was 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.439
 climb the mountain I did it with great 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.479
 work and sea ​​of ​​the car all the same 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.070
 by the way wheelbarrow and blindly good too 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.649
 suitable jeep too and well, nothing here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.590
 did not happen I went I went I thought maybe 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 something else no no no that was the end 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 Easter eggs all seemed so dead to me 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690
 the dead 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.459
 a copy can be said of the forces of the moment from 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.319
 the film I get in their car and little by little 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.950
 I do legs and what can I do? 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:27.030
 I got $ 25,000 for free 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.269
 or as people say dollars and drove 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.870
 about his business you never know but not here then 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.849
 I was stopped a little farther into the woods went 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.900
 under the bridge so as not to glow 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.079
 the main road is all such food myself 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.629
 humming glad money a lot seems everything 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.989
 life was good but not here it was behind 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.030
 motorcycle chasers appear 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.280
 just like their movie then 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.310
 this dude with a suitcase chased 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.319
 very long and actually it was 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.379
 his problem throughout the film 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.099
 that he took this suitcase well, I then abruptly 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.370
 that hero just piled them filled up 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.430
 also took their mountain bike on 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.530
 which article and fell from this point not 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.720
 I know how lucky you are for this easter egg 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.489
 because i'm burning it is random 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 I think there is a chance 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.260
 random events yes that is for example 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.030
 here you know there are events in the game when 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.459
 man robbed and you need to kill up 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.169
 robber to return the money and in my opinion here 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.150
 the same thing may be me wrong 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.829
 I don't know, maybe I am not mistaken 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.269
 check try if you see me 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.280
 it seems that for some reason it may be 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.319
 a completely different place but it could be 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.560
 no, maybe try here 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.359
 take a trip for the 3rd time fuso any 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.449
 character in my because of the other can 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.669
 for franklin congress check and i'm 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.470
 principle was pleased and because i 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.940
 big fan of this movie and its always 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.480
 can be reconsidered who not watched 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.650
 I advise old men here is not the place just 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.349

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.079

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.940
 that soon I will do something more ambitious 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.639
 now work has started a little time 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.560
 Well, actually, everything remains 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.620
 I am still going to bomb the videos 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.449

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.549
