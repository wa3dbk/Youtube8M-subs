00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.590
 halo has flavio simonetti here from the salad 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.570
 the biceps shrinks i have my video 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.880
 to get a bit of criticism was my mistake 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.409
 Of course I do not have the target group 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.179
 properly defined as I the video 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:25.480
 I've been bad at that 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:29.109
 salad gets the sacred vegetables 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.599
 apparently no here on my channel 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.420
 I had no idea what the reason was but it worked 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.640
 so guys want to take that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.590
 but that it was the target group the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.280
 guys want to build muscle and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.540
 Now salad salad is somewhere 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.800
 the topic I always am today 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.650
 wants to appeal 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.360
 salad consists of 95 percent water 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.670
 that means if I'm here in big now 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.960
 I can eat fat salad here as well 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.200
 tuck some water 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.050
 Of course, there was also some time ago 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:05.530
 the rumor that salad is too valuable 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.719
 like a damp paper handkerchief all over 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.380
 but I do not see it that bad 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:14.439
 nonetheless, the shares of vitamins 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 minerals and others 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.249
 secondary plant substances 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.109
 example are very nice but mine 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:23.740
 opinion, I need for no 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.319
 eat salad what is interesting to 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.509
 example for pregnant women is there 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.999
 precautions contain folic acid has the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.319
 advantage that it is the pregnancy 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.689
 simply supported and miscarriage 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.670
 reduces a very important topic 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.819
 the pregnancy of disadvantage in 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.889
 On the other hand salad is again if you 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.719
 if a woman is pregnant and she 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:45.219
 does not particularly suit that salad 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.020
 Magic is the other 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.840
 Bacteria enter and on the child 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 hurt so it's a double-edged one 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.689
 sword for pregnant women 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.549
 there is still the target group people who 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.109
 wanting to lose weight is no question salad is 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.969
 There is a good chance for a good deal 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.900
 possibilities to fill the stomach with 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.060
 things the little carlo 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.620
 it is possible with the salad 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.900
 Of course you have to watch what you do 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.880
 there are people who say yes me 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.620
 Make me salad and create is the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.930
 Full salad with so much thin shit 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.490
 that the connection here 800 to 1000 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.800
 calories then you can get something 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.730
 Slash and eat other calories and eat 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.290
 the next thing something salad 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.070
 Advocates say the secondary 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.680
 plant materials 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.020
 yes they are interesting somewhere 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 are anti-inflammatory and above all 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.180
 also, they should be good for allergies 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.570
 against party what i ask myself 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.250
 do not know anyone who says ' man I take 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.170
 Now I have it much more salad now 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.480
 as anti-inflammatory is perhaps 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.160
 also completely because she is not me 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.280
 not so deep in the health industry 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.280
 and I also know no one to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.810
 told me flavio has I have quite 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.110
 have had many allergies but since then i 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.790
 salad eat so since I now any 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.800
 Half a kilo of salad a day is the topic 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.050
 allergies all completely gone that 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.330
 of course, the benefits of somewhere in 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.890
 a salad as secondary plant matter 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
 are included and secondary 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.850
 Plant matter is also important 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.310
 just asking do I need salad tell 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.480
 times when I need my vitamins 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.190
 wants to cover minerals 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.489
 then I eat vegetables in the form of say 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.780
 we spinach in the form of broccoli in form 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:35.440
 of herb carrots There are many many 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.660
 possibilities or the other thing I do 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.330
 it just a lot of fruit, yes, but also 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.940
 extremely many vitamins have many enzymes 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.739
 enzymen extremely underestimated because 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.260
 ultimately too over for it too 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.910
 I'm responsible for that at all 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.910
 protein are ever made and the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.890
 be implemented so on what so 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.840
 want to say that is quite nice that it 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.250
 salad gives and also has a big one 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.900
 advantage for people who want to lose weight 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.220
 but if you want to take then leave 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.290
 the fingers of the salad 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.330
 they do not just cost his valuable ones 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.799
 games and we need them at all 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.750
 not important is that you are neat 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.030
 calories and when you salad 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.970
 is and has no idea 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.890
 then it can change alright you unfortunately 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.060
 still not to take that was that 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.250
 video what I really wanted to say 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.959
 everything is a bit abbreviated and have 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.510
 forget to mention important aspects 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.770
 Here again thanks to the critics that 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.389
 then i can do this video here 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.220
 and here I could explain something 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.020
 create so if you want to take is 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.060
 very important carbohydrates 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.450
 I recommend potatoes 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.310
 rice noodles bread to eat 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.180
 I would recommend oatmeal protein 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.490
 so yes about 20 percent 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.430
 that is so I 'm going from 16 to 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.910
 maximum of two grams of protein from meat 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.160
 fish and so on and fat 30 percent 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.890
 damn much more calories than that 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.780
 carbohydrates and protein that is called 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.340
 30 field masters in the first moment 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.200
 many if I am but again 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.260
 Break down through the crowd 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.970
 achieves that much faster 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.610
 and there it is important if you have the amount 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.450
 not achieved in any case good oil 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.669
 For example, walnut oil is linseed oil 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.060
 it is also very good but the implementation in the 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.400
 body is not quite as effective and 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.250
 rivers yes these are the possibilities 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.220
 then you need hans as fertilizer as well as 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.500
 I used to be at 56 kilo each 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.610
 case muscle mass on the a and o and that 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.020
 I wanted to bring you soon 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.050
 I'm definitely like it 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.560
 and subscribe to the youtube channel 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.710
 because of the salad fifth of this and if you 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.990
 finally muscle building no idea what 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.360
 like a workout, what are you planning committee 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.449
 should make use and which 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.360
 Rarely on you like a muscle 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.610
 Any text and so on should she

 you will find a guide at 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.930
