00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
there will be no cause so we'll see I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580 
there will be no cause so we'll see I
mean<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.450> think<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.020> would<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.259> good<00:00:22.410> fun

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
mean it I think it would be good fun

mean it I think it would be good fun
Sabin<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.279> mean<00:00:23.460> there's<00:00:23.669> no<00:00:23.759> better<00:00:23.910> track<00:00:24.210> for

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
Sabin I mean there's no better track for

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.519 
Sabin I mean there's no better track for
both<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.599> us<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> race<00:00:24.960> each<00:00:24.989> other<00:00:25.349> in<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.090 

it<00:00:34.940> was<00:00:35.180> infinity<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.900> petrol<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.590> Infiniti

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
it was infinity and petrol and Infiniti

M<00:00:37.220> Hybrid<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:38.240> paper<00:00:38.540> was<00:00:39.110> such<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.350> fair<00:00:39.530> match

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
M Hybrid on paper was such a fair match

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.210 
M Hybrid on paper was such a fair match
I<00:00:40.160> think<00:00:41.000> people's<00:00:41.330> perceptions<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.440> hybrid

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
I think people's perceptions of hybrid

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.290 
I think people's perceptions of hybrid
cars<00:00:43.400> at<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.640> moment<00:00:43.940> is<00:00:44.000> they're<00:00:44.150> just

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
cars at the moment is they're just

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.729 
cars at the moment is they're just
probably<00:00:44.420> just<00:00:44.660> don't<00:00:44.900> cut<00:00:45.200> up<00:00:45.290> not<00:00:45.470> go<00:00:45.620> on

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
probably just don't cut up not go on

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.650 
probably just don't cut up not go on
myself<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:46.400> moving<00:00:46.910> away<00:00:47.059> really<00:00:47.300> house

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
myself and it moving away really house

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.360 
myself and it moving away really house
or<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:47.989> responsive<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.950> North<00:00:49.130> Slope

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
or the responsive it is the North Slope

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.729 
or the responsive it is the North Slope
is<00:00:49.520> one<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.880> I<00:00:50.120> think<00:00:50.690> most<00:00:51.170> challenging

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
is one of the I think most challenging

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.710 
is one of the I think most challenging
tracks<00:00:52.550> in<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.790> world<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.210> takes<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.540> lot<00:00:53.690> of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
tracks in the world it takes a lot of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.990 
tracks in the world it takes a lot of
laps<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.080> really<00:00:54.410> know<00:00:54.590> where<00:00:55.340> you<00:00:55.489> are<00:00:55.520> it

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
laps to really know where you are it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.700 
laps to really know where you are it
would<00:00:56.120> be<00:00:56.270> actually<00:00:56.449> quite<00:00:56.720> good<00:00:57.080> fun<00:00:57.320> you

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
would be actually quite good fun you

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.260 
would be actually quite good fun you
know<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.949> try<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:58.220> in<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.430> Formula<00:00:58.730> One<00:00:58.760> car<00:00:58.910> but

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
know to try it in a Formula One car but

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.360 
know to try it in a Formula One car but
I<00:00:59.330> think<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.629> cars<00:00:59.900> today<00:01:00.170> I'm<00:01:00.470> not<00:01:00.650> really

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
I think the cars today I'm not really

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.500 
I think the cars today I'm not really
made<00:01:01.610> for<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.910> anymore

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
made for that anymore

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.570 
made for that anymore
they're<00:01:02.690> too<00:01:02.989> low<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:03.710> still<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.309> know<00:01:04.430> it's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
they're too low but still you know it's

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.999 
they're too low but still you know it's
a<00:01:04.670> fun<00:01:04.850> track<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.869> race<00:01:06.050> was<00:01:06.290> on<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.740> prove

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
a fun track so the race was on to prove

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
a point or two and it didn't take long

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.870 
a point or two and it didn't take long
to<00:01:09.380> turn<00:01:09.649> into<00:01:09.800> something<00:01:10.070> slightly<00:01:10.520> more

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
to turn into something slightly more

things<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.929> can<00:02:06.080> happen<00:02:06.259> especially<00:02:06.860> around

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
things that can happen especially around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.130 
things that can happen especially around
here<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:07.940> never<00:02:08.209> know<00:02:08.450> until<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.810> know

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
here so you never know until you know

checkered flags with the weather it can

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.180 
checkered flags with the weather it can
always<00:02:10.940> change<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:12.680> will<00:02:12.830> see<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
always change then we will see in the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.100 
always change then we will see in the
race<00:02:13.370> how<00:02:13.670> easy<00:02:13.880> or<00:02:14.150> difficult<00:02:14.269> it<00:02:14.900> might<00:02:15.049> be

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
race how easy or difficult it might be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
race how easy or difficult it might be

overtaking<00:02:20.239> around<00:02:20.480> Nurburgring<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.049> still

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
overtaking around Nurburgring we still

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.070 
overtaking around Nurburgring we still
will<00:02:21.799> still<00:02:22.069> going<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> be<00:02:22.900> difficult<00:02:23.900> because

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
will still going to be difficult because

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.259 
will still going to be difficult because
the<00:02:24.799> corners<00:02:25.220> especially<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.790> exits<00:02:26.120> are

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
the corners especially the exits are

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.140 
the corners especially the exits are
quite<00:02:26.540> fast<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.489> easy<00:02:28.790> it's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
quite fast so it's not that easy it's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.849 
quite fast so it's not that easy it's
difficult<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.690> stay<00:02:29.900> close<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.200> another<00:02:30.590> car

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
difficult to stay close to another car

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.650 
difficult to stay close to another car
to<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.579> know<00:02:31.609> try<00:02:31.730> something<00:02:31.940> into<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
to then you know try something into the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.449 
to then you know try something into the
next<00:02:32.900> braking<00:02:33.320> zone<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:33.769> it's<00:02:34.250> not

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
next braking zone but it's not

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.220 
next braking zone but it's not
impossible<00:02:34.670> there's<00:02:35.299> worse<00:02:35.480> places<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:36.079> sure

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
impossible there's worse places for sure

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.280 
impossible there's worse places for sure

I<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.840> true<00:02:42.049> has<00:02:42.290> proven<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:43.269> they<00:02:44.269> have

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
I have true has proven that they have

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.050 
I have true has proven that they have
made<00:02:44.570> big<00:02:44.810> steps<00:02:44.989> forward<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:46.850> they

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
made big steps forward and you know they

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.490 
made big steps forward and you know they
are<00:02:47.180> real<00:02:47.359> challenge<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.959> think<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.290> will<00:02:48.380> be

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
are real challenge I think it will be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.530 
are real challenge I think it will be
very<00:02:48.620> tight<00:02:48.920> even<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> day<00:02:49.640> where<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.209> might

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
very tight even on a day where we might

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.360 
very tight even on a day where we might
not<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.750> able<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.109> win<00:02:51.290> at<00:02:51.829> least<00:02:51.859> try<00:02:52.310> to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
not be able to win at least try to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.400 
not be able to win at least try to
finish<00:02:52.640> second<00:02:53.120> or<00:02:53.269> then<00:02:53.480> third<00:02:53.810> pressure<00:02:54.200> is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
finish second or then third pressure is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.349 
finish second or then third pressure is
always<00:02:54.680> there<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.549> your<00:02:55.579> own<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.239> your
