00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.580 
you know why I like it it's the most
realistic<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
realistic but and that's what I like

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
realistic but and that's what I like
I<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> realistic<00:02:15.330> ones<00:02:15.540> too<00:02:15.750> but

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I don't like to realistic ones too but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.670 
I don't like to realistic ones too but
I'm<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:16.410> watching<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.040> used<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> clouds<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I'm not watching I used the clouds that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.089 
I'm not watching I used the clouds that
ain't<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.090> realistic<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.890> no

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
ain't very realistic was not I have no

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.490 
ain't very realistic was not I have no
reason<00:02:23.760> why<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.230> part

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
reason why you and I think that's part

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.290 
reason why you and I think that's part
of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.620> reason<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.250> motorcycle<00:02:26.580> -<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
of the reason like this motorcycle - is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.420 
of the reason like this motorcycle - is
that<00:02:27.450> right<00:02:27.660> there<00:02:27.930> realistic<00:02:28.650> looking<00:02:28.980> exact

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that right there realistic looking exact

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.220 
that right there realistic looking exact
a<00:02:29.670> motorcycle<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.510> that's<00:02:30.690> another<00:02:30.989> reason

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
a motorcycle and that's another reason

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.530 
a motorcycle and that's another reason
why<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.860> track<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.030> realistic

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
why I like this track it's a realistic

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.290 
why I like this track it's a realistic
track<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.620> gotta<00:02:34.769> lift<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.430> trash<00:02:35.790> Spinney

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
track you gotta lift the trash Spinney

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.790 
track you gotta lift the trash Spinney
so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> guess<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.140> about<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> little
