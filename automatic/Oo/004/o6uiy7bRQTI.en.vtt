00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.550
 rejuvenating apples invites you to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.460
 program codes and we developed code 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.250
 youth under getting rid of the disease 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.560
 year of motherhood and a very interesting code 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.580
 which gives absolutely today for free 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 little cat called code laughter i 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 laugh therapist you know what has long been on 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.640
 rusi was such a movement as jaws 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 and feelings and buffoon was very important 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.290
 figure because people are so serious 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.370
 that they forget to laugh no longer 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 from a smile she is very simple today 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 we'll talk about those exercises 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.149
 which will help us just keep 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 smile we have right here right in the middle 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.129
 cheeks are called such dimples smiles when 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 many people laugh at him from them 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.399
 here dimples we take and massage 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 these dimples first one way time 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.260
 two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 and then the other side is two three three 5 5 6 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.979
 7 8 9 10 and now try to smile 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 all at once as you feel some 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 feels and it is you that are very 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.080
 unnatural 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.869
 so here I want to say that laughter infects 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 we speak and smile infects if if 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.250

 always say everything to the king all the news all 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.650
 because he was not afraid of anything sometimes by him 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.140
