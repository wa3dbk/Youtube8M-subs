 took him to a small rural village 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.500
 Spanish the truth is that we treat the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 tourism much better than what was seen in 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.930
 this game where the villagers showed 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.180
 a killer instinct because of a 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.280
 virus little by little we will discover 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 more about the strange events that we 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.149
 surrounded and their main protagonists 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.399
 in this game there were no zombies but 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.439
 infected with different types and with 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.750
 different weapons which showed 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.420
 greater resistance as we advanced 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.000
 in the game as well as mutations when 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.069
 we shot them smarter enemies 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 evolves bless numerous and lethal 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.420
 go panorama by luck to make them 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.899
 front we would get a quantity 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.069
 of important weapons that we could improve 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.020
 In addition to the environment it offered 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.479
 more open and dynamic locations 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
 the main difference lies in the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.920
 playability using the camera behind the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.439
 character approaching towards the shoulder 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.200
 when we aimed we had total freedom 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.789
 to aim where we would like to join 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.739
 a strong inherited coup that 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.049
 we could use the enemy when 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.539
 they lowered their guard or they were half 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.819
 I died votes there were a lot of actions and 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.579
 interactions to be carried out according to what 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.469
 we were part of the environment though 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.390
 we also had puzzles and situations 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.190
 that required to be visited at least 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 a couple of times to be able to unlock 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.140
 accesses there was also a lot of 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.600
 action that if the survival component 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.530
 it still lasted with little ammunition 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.569
 invent 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.490
 limited and plants that whenever you 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.980
 it cost more to find to heal 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.750
 our wounds were also included 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.140
 some quick time events in certain 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.120
 situations or sequences at that moment 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 the change the great wine to the series that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 he was screaming for a turn in his gameplay 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.480
 the graphic aspect also evolved 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.730
 exceedingly being one of the titles 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.250
 what better squeezed consolero software 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.410
 of the anger to take off our hats is 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
 little before the excellent work in this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.110
 set aside scenes and characters took 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.670

 certain characters married very well with 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.019
 the voices in Spanish good more or less 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.970
 of many of the infected enemies to
