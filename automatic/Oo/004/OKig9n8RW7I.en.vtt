 they served as a means of transport 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.680
 as a working tool 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.910
 of war 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.429
 and as a symbol of friendship 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.429
 fairy parties carry enchanted princes 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.969
 for the children of the apae in pellets they bring hope and quality of 

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:18.789
 life 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.769

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.489

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.619
 with special needs pessuti be limited medical offices 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850

 the therapeutic and educational method that uses the horse within an approach 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.340
 interdisciplinary 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 in the areas of health education and riding 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.380
 The main objective is to seek the development of people with 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.640
 special needs 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.670
 the south horse first because the southern freak 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.870
 it's an animal we leave behind after we graduate 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.240
 and he has one thing we're the movement to mention one 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.360
 which is what gives me most commands I actually the horse's march 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.600
 she's 95% goal from the man she does the same seeing that I went to the march that the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.370
 people love him make him walk 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 the children practice this therapy once a week 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.170
 in the rural association of pellets 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.790
 before that they undergo an evaluation to know if the treatment 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.050
 indicated for home 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.230
 so that everyone has the opportunity to participate and is 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.860
 three years 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.830
 one of the reasons that limits the expansion of the project is the lack of structure success 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.049
 authorized by the national association directly to the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.420
 military operations that had this function now, in addition to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.509
 qualified others through courses 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400
 beijing generally riding health people who make up team of the 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.040
 nascar 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 they do not have the knowledge of cation so the importance of the instructor of 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 creation of indicator name painting and discipline 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.890
 facilitates the approach process and passes safety etc. 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.909
 Equine therapy also says it is contrary to children 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.730
 factor that favors activities for the development of communication 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.680
 As a smoker I have two Dutch chemotherapy approaches and the first one is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.609
 working with oral communication 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.879
 and with breathing neither to the movement of the horse posture that the child stays in 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.059
 up the horse now I hope she has better as to the nation than 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.979
 wait is 20 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.319
 vocalizes also of speaking with oral communication 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.949
 a task that has the campaign works with the terminating communication natania 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.150
 ten years 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.200
 I did not talk or walk 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.050
 now practicing the wallet for five years had the vaccine in his year with the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.470
 results is a product all 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.329
 Why did he walk already? 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.270
 they speak 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.220
 He's going to leave the store without him walking with us, right? 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.200
 So 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.750
 everything changed because we wanted to have more freedom to go home 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.959
 that whole thing was something that hit the layer 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:13.440

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.380
 It's Wonderful
