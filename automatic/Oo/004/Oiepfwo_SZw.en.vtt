00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello today we're going to be talking about 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.259
 marketing for a company of architects 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.540
 an architect who wanted to increase their 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.700
 sales and I wanted to see what options you 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.500
 offered the internet as a tool 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.820
 marketing to achieve after 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.530
 several conversations with them and several 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.119
 meetings we reach some conclusions 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.070
 basic that I'm sure you can 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.510
 serve a lot of companies that are 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.520
 in situations similar to theirs 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.000
 the first conclusion we reached 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.010
 is the need for focus 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.930
 like many other small businesses and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.810
 medium and many web sites in 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.390
 internet most companies 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.920
 scripts offer from the entire website 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.650
 it's as if they said we do 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.360
 anything from remodeling to 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 apartment to construction 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.379
 skyscraper the truth is that when 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.949
 You have a message that is for all 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.480
 world 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.800
 you 're really not reaching anyone 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.060
 you have no message that is meaningful 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.460
 for no one 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.080
 on the internet the new businesses come to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.320
 through two large doors the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.170
 search engines and social networks and both 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.600
 doors reward specialists for 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.220
 on top of the generalists for you 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.870
 for your company what I recommend is that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.270
 find what those things that you 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.830
 move that you are passionate and in that you 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.170
 dedicate yourself in the focus and you become 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 a recognized specialist in that area 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 on the internet the second conclusion to the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 What we got is that it's important 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.420
 share the value it is important that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 others know what your ideas are 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 opinions what is it that you are adding 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 in each design many of the websites 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 that we were reviewing the company's 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 the competition in the background are based on 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.450
 good as I show the best projects 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.810
 which are the most important projects 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 the most original designs of the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.540
 more monumental projects that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.630
 they did but as important as that is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.640
 It is to make people see why 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.920
 you made a decision is what are your 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.479
 opinions what are the things that you 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 they differ from the rest of the people by 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.800
 what did you decide to implement a project 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.390
 one way and not another for customers 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.700
 The projects you have designed are 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.000
 important but more important than that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.820
 is 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.440
 how are you going to design the new projects 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.620
 what are the things that you add to 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.140
 design new new new buildings 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.820
 new homes remodeling in the background 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.610
 what you want and are achieving with your 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.290
 clients is to connect your capabilities with 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 the needs of your customers all 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.750
 the cases the contents you have in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.970
 your website 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.890
 it is important that they think about how they are going to 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.320
 be found then you have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 Content made in a video or photos 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.450
 with render and you have to make it text 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.130
 that is easily found and that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.800
 focus on the focus that you already defined in the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.940
 Previous point for God's sake do not do 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.820
 a portfolio or catalog that weighs 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.890
 10 gigas or that weigh a lot very much 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.350
 size that has a very large size and 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.510
 that nobody can share is important 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.100
 that content that you can do what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 do in pieces think of things 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.340
 small that you can share the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 third conclusion to which we come is 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.840
 that it is important to cultivate 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.500
 relationships in the links with 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.060
 relationships you have with other people 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.060
 here you can start with very 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.560
 basic as good the website of your 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.540
 university for example that I have a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.640
 link to your company the website of the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.110
 guild to which it surely belongs but 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.970
 after them can be a list of 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.980
 all the websites that you're interested in 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.140
 you make a link that have a link 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.240
 towards you to your site to be 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.860
 raise the prestige to your website and for 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.900
 there new business starts to arrive 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.690
 new prospects as you have 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.640
 more prestige more people will reach your 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.680
 website and therefore more visitors more 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.870
 prospects and more projects you're going to 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 get the fourth and last conclusion 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.640
 which we arrive at is important 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.350
 build an audience that is in 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.060
 build people who are willing to 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.160
 receive your information and be 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.630
 interested in the topics that you speak in 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.980
 the positions that opinions have 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.319
 who have 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.780
 and that regularly receives information from 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.330
 It is important that this search 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.430
 initial that resulted in a visit was 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.530
 can translate into a relationship more than 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.290
 medium and long term that can be so 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.120
 simple as a mailing list or that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.370
 become followers on twitter or that 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.920
 have a like on the fanpage what is 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.680
 important is that you can convert to that 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.079
 visitor in an acquaintance and you can 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.180
 start having a regular communication 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.130
 to get the value of the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.250
 things that you are building I am Roberto
