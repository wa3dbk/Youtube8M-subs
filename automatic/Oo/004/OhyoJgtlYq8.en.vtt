genes<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:20.010> those<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.820> frequencies<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

those have changed over time I mean I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.859 
those have changed over time I mean I
think<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.880> fundamental<00:00:24.480> subject<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
think it's just a fundamental subject it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
think it's just a fundamental subject it
tells<00:00:25.140> us<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.439> where<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.890> came<00:00:26.099> from<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
tells us about where we came from and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.480 
tells us about where we came from and

technology<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.820> allows<00:01:48.000> us<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.450> look

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
technology which now allows us to look

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350 
technology which now allows us to look
in-depth<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.530> DNA<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> individuals<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
in-depth at DNA of individuals in the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
in-depth at DNA of individuals in the
past<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.860> couldn't<00:01:53.159> prove<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> was

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
past so if you couldn't prove it was

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.100 
past so if you couldn't prove it was
Richard<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> third<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.540> strand<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
Richard the third on any one strand of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.300 
Richard the third on any one strand of
evidence<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.100> all

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
evidence but when you put it all

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670 
evidence but when you put it all
together<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.750> answer<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.200> came<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.409> with

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
together the the answer we came up with

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.830 
together the the answer we came up with
is<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.130> can't<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.579> anyone<00:01:59.969> else<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.390> has<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is it can't be anyone else it has to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.109 
is it can't be anyone else it has to
which<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:01.350> third<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.100> public's<00:02:02.549> reaction<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
which the third the public's reaction to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
which the third the public's reaction to
the<00:02:03.210> discovery<00:02:03.570> has<00:02:03.810> been<00:02:03.990> amazing<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.649> don't

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the discovery has been amazing I don't

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
the discovery has been amazing I don't
think<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.340> into<00:02:05.609> this<00:02:05.850> project<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.539> had<00:02:06.750> any

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
think going into this project we had any

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.259 
think going into this project we had any
concept<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.740> how<00:02:07.799> amazing<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
concept of how amazing it would be and

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.750 
concept of how amazing it would be and
how<00:02:09.450> global<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.349> would<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.340> seems<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> have

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
how global it would be it seems to have

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.910 
how global it would be it seems to have
caught<00:02:12.030> everybody's<00:02:12.780> imagination<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.620> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
caught everybody's imagination that this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920 
caught everybody's imagination that this
store<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:15.000> interested<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.660> doing

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
store I'm really interested in doing

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.809 
store I'm really interested in doing
some<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.470> work<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.890> Richard<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> things

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
some more work on Richard some of things

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.789 
some more work on Richard some of things
you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.299> is<00:02:18.450> looking<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.959> things<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.319> DNA

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
you can do is looking at things like DNA

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.410 
you can do is looking at things like DNA
from<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> calculus<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.910> stuff<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
from the calculus so that stuff that the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.270 
from the calculus so that stuff that the
dentist<00:02:21.840> scrapes<00:02:22.200> off<00:02:22.470> when<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.920> go<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.129> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
dentist scrapes off when you go to the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.100 
dentist scrapes off when you go to the
dentist<00:02:23.459> actually<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
dentist actually in there you can get a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.839 
dentist actually in there you can get a
lot<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.440> DNA<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.370> look<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.640> things

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
lot of DNA and you can look at things

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.880 
lot of DNA and you can look at things
like<00:02:26.970> Richards<00:02:27.599> diet<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.410> things<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.830> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
like Richards diet and things like that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.979 
like Richards diet and things like that
but<00:02:29.430> also<00:02:29.580> doing<00:02:29.879> wider<00:02:30.090> studies<00:02:30.540> looking<00:02:30.900> at

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
but also doing wider studies looking at

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.979 
but also doing wider studies looking at
the<00:02:31.110> peopling<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.530> Britain<00:02:32.010> using<00:02:32.989> ancient

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
the peopling of Britain using ancient

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.140 
the peopling of Britain using ancient
DNA<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.769> look<00:02:35.130> at<00:02:35.250> actually<00:02:35.579> remains<00:02:35.910> of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
DNA to look at actually remains of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
DNA to look at actually remains of
individuals<00:02:36.720> from<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.200> period<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.769> think

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
individuals from the period I think

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.839 
individuals from the period I think
would<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> really<00:02:38.310> interesting<00:02:38.519> thing<00:02:38.819> to

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
would be a really interesting thing to

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.630 
would be a really interesting thing to
do<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.269> think<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.319> an<00:02:40.530> emerging<00:02:41.040> field

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
do I think it's a it's an emerging field

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640 
do I think it's a it's an emerging field
essentially<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.989> new<00:02:43.140> technologies

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
essentially it's the new technologies

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
essentially it's the new technologies
are<00:02:43.769> allowing<00:02:43.890> us<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:44.730> much<00:02:44.910> more<00:02:45.209> now

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
are allowing us to do so much more now

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.770 
are allowing us to do so much more now
so<00:02:46.200> you're<00:02:46.560> at<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> start<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.720> a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
so you're at the start of this I think a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.869 
so you're at the start of this I think a
real<00:02:48.959> wave<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.620> being<00:02:49.829> able<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.129> use<00:02:50.340> genetics

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
real wave and being able to use genetics

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.020 
real wave and being able to use genetics
to<00:02:51.030> look<00:02:51.209> at<00:02:51.390> ancient<00:02:52.310> events<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.549> past<00:02:53.579> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to look at ancient events in the past I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.720 
to look at ancient events in the past I
get<00:02:54.239> asked<00:02:54.720> what's<00:02:55.140> next<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> lot<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.980> times<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
get asked what's next a lot of times and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
get asked what's next a lot of times and
sort<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.510> how<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.989> top<00:02:58.260> finding<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.799> king

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
sort of how can you top finding a king

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.140 
sort of how can you top finding a king
of<00:02:59.099> England<00:02:59.519> big<00:02:59.790> thing<00:03:00.000> will<00:03:00.120> actually

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
of England big thing will actually

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.270 
of England big thing will actually
probably<00:03:00.629> be<00:03:00.959> sort<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.829> same<00:03:02.010> its

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
probably be sort of more of the same its

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.360 
probably be sort of more of the same its
whole<00:03:02.640> genome<00:03:03.390> sequencing<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.500> individuals

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
whole genome sequencing of individuals

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.849 
whole genome sequencing of individuals
from<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.730> past<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.389> that's<00:03:07.380> really<00:03:07.590> cool

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
from the past and that's really cool

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:08.720 
from the past and that's really cool
because<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.250> look<00:03:08.489> at<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> genetic

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
because you can look at the genetic

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.360 
because you can look at the genetic
makeup<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.420> populations<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.250> also

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
makeup of populations but you can also

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370 
makeup of populations but you can also
look<00:03:11.639> at<00:03:11.790> how<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.389> frequency<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> particular

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
look at how the frequency of particular

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.440 
look at how the frequency of particular
genes<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.859> changed<00:03:14.400> through<00:03:14.880> time<00:03:14.910> which<00:03:15.420> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
genes have changed through time which is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.479 
genes have changed through time which is
really<00:03:15.810> interesting<00:03:16.530> whenever<00:03:17.099> there's<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
really interesting whenever there's a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.890 
really interesting whenever there's a
new<00:03:17.639> building<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.540> Leicester

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
new building going up in Leicester

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.009 
new building going up in Leicester
England<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.849> might<00:03:21.599> be<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.959> those

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
England I might be one of those
