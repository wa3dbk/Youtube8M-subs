00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it in and it snaps into place

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.520 
it in and it snaps into place
now<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:26.260> isn't<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.770> cutout<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.530> on/off

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
here which works really well there's the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.290 
here which works really well there's the

a cutout for the headphone socket and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.640 
a cutout for the headphone socket and
the<00:02:48.130> dock<00:02:48.430> connector<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.080> course<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the dock connector and of course the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.110 
the dock connector and of course the
front<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> ipod<00:02:52.300> remains<00:02:53.400> open<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.060> you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
front of the ipod remains open so you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.990 
front of the ipod remains open so you
can<00:02:55.269> obviously<00:02:55.450> access<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.170> touch<00:02:56.440> screen

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
can obviously access that touch screen

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.140 
can obviously access that touch screen
it's<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.390> really<00:02:59.100> nicely<00:03:00.100> made<00:03:00.400> case<00:03:00.880> I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
it's a really really nicely made case I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.820 
it's a really really nicely made case I
like<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.540> fact<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.050> flexible<00:03:02.620> but

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
like the fact that it's flexible but

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.550 
like the fact that it's flexible but
also<00:03:02.950> has<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.580> plastic<00:03:04.330> sort<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.290> hard

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
also has this plastic sort of hard

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.850 
also has this plastic sort of hard
finish<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.540> offers<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.870> nice<00:03:08.560> amount

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
finish to it and it offers a nice amount

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.430 
finish to it and it offers a nice amount
of<00:03:09.010> protection<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.450> all<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
of protection and for the all of the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160 
of protection and for the all of the
cases<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.130> reviewed<00:03:12.610> over<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> past<00:03:13.870> few

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
cases that I reviewed over the past few

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.530 
cases that I reviewed over the past few
years<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.799> really<00:03:15.580> like<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.850> design<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.299> this

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
years I really like the design of this

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.559 
years I really like the design of this
one<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.560> stands<00:03:18.010> out<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.489> feels<00:03:18.819> really

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
one it stands out and it feels really

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.050 
one it stands out and it feels really
nice<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> hand<00:03:20.290> as<00:03:20.709> well<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:21.130> think<00:03:21.519> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
nice in the hand as well I think the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.850 
nice in the hand as well I think the
fact<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.540> you've<00:03:22.840> got<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.110> glossy<00:03:23.650> hard

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
fact that you've got this glossy hard

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.009 
fact that you've got this glossy hard
finish<00:03:24.130> on<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.489> back<00:03:24.700> makes<00:03:25.569> it<00:03:25.750> feel<00:03:25.989> like

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
finish on the back makes it feel like

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.370 
finish on the back makes it feel like
