00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.470 

so<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:10.050> talking<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:11.480> immune

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so now we're talking about the immune

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.609 
so now we're talking about the immune
system<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.110> body<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:14.519> different

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
system of the body and what different

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.810 
system of the body and what different
availabilities<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.160> combat<00:00:17.609> saya

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
availabilities there are two combat saya

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
availabilities there are two combat saya
if<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.300> an<00:00:18.359> infection<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.619> first

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
if there was an infection so our first

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.830 
if there was an infection so our first
question<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:21.060> term<00:00:21.300> describes<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
question is which term describes a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
question is which term describes a
molecule<00:00:22.439> capable<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> triggering<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.550> immune

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
molecule capable of triggering an immune

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
molecule capable of triggering an immune
response<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.289> comes<00:00:25.529> down<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
response and this really comes down to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
response and this really comes down to
knowing<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.220> definitions<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> these<00:00:27.300> four

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
knowing your definitions of these four

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.950 
knowing your definitions of these four
basic<00:00:28.279> terms<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.810> one

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
basic terms here so first of all one

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
basic terms here so first of all one
antibody<00:00:31.470> no<00:00:31.859> antibody<00:00:32.790> um<00:00:33.000> actually

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
antibody no antibody um actually

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
antibody no antibody um actually
attaches<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.750> antigen<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
attaches to the to an antigen and that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
attaches to the to an antigen and that
can<00:00:38.010> cause<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.670> engulfed<00:00:39.059> by

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
can cause it to be engulfed by

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.380 
can cause it to be engulfed by
macrophages<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:40.230> other<00:00:41.239> antigen<00:00:42.239> presenting

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
macrophages or other antigen presenting

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.860 
macrophages or other antigen presenting
cells<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.040> antibody<00:00:44.489> B<00:00:45.270> antigen

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
cells so it's not an antibody B antigen

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
cells so it's not an antibody B antigen
that<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> correct<00:00:46.649> answer<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that is the correct answer because you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.959 
that is the correct answer because you
have<00:00:47.820> antigens<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.629> our<00:00:49.440> pathogens<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
have antigens on our pathogens and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.069 
have antigens on our pathogens and then
they<00:00:51.710> cause<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> immune<00:00:53.399> system<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.780> say

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they cause the immune system to to say

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
they cause the immune system to to say
okay<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.920> I'm<00:00:56.399> foreign<00:00:56.789> react<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> me

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
okay look I'm I'm foreign react to me

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.369 
okay look I'm I'm foreign react to me
and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.590> immune<00:00:58.829> response<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> form

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and then an immune response to the form

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.260 
and then an immune response to the form
C<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.590> pathogen<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.640> incorrect<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
C a pathogen this is incorrect a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
C a pathogen this is incorrect a
pathogen<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:05.010> need<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> know

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
pathogen is actually you need to know

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
pathogen is actually you need to know
the<00:01:05.400> definition<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> pathogen<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> that's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the definition for a pathogen and that's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
the definition for a pathogen and that's
one<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:08.180> definitions<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
one of the first definitions that you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880 
one of the first definitions that you
need<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.260> particular<00:01:10.530> topic

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
need to know in this particular topic

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
need to know in this particular topic
and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> definition<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> pathogen<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> an

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and the definition of the pathogen is an

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
and the definition of the pathogen is an
organism<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> virus<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.850> causes<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
organism or a virus that causes the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.550 
organism or a virus that causes the
disease<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> doesn't<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:17.880> cause<00:01:18.720> an

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
disease so it doesn't actually cause an

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560 
disease so it doesn't actually cause an
immune<00:01:19.799> response<00:01:19.979> itself<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
immune response itself and the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
immune response itself and the
antibiotic<00:01:22.140> obviously<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:22.950> an

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
antibiotic obviously not because an

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
antibiotic obviously not because an
antibiotic<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.090> doesn't<00:01:24.420> trigger<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.869> immune

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
antibiotic it doesn't trigger an immune

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
antibiotic it doesn't trigger an immune
response<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.400> helps<00:01:26.610> fight<00:01:26.970> an

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
response it actually helps fight an

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.539 
response it actually helps fight an
infection<00:01:28.229> by<00:01:28.500> blocking<00:01:29.189> certain<00:01:29.340> pathways

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
infection by blocking certain pathways

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
infection by blocking certain pathways
okay<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> need<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> talk<00:01:33.329> about<00:01:33.450> HIV

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
okay so now I need to talk about HIV

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.149 
okay so now I need to talk about HIV
what<00:01:35.159> does<00:01:35.430> HIV<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.600> HIV<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> caused

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
what does HIV do so HIV does that caused

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
what does HIV do so HIV does that caused
a<00:01:38.189> reduction<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.909> antibody<00:01:39.390> production<00:01:39.689> yes

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
a reduction in antibody production yes

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
a reduction in antibody production yes
it<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.369> increase<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> active

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it does and an increase in active

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630 
it does and an increase in active
lymphocytes<00:01:42.840> no<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> HIV

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
lymphocytes no you want to think of HIV

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
lymphocytes no you want to think of HIV
as<00:01:44.790> pressing<00:01:45.360> everything<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.200> reduces

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
as pressing everything down it reduces

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
as pressing everything down it reduces
the<00:01:46.829> number<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.100> antibodies<00:01:47.729> reduces<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the number of antibodies reduces the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
the number of antibodies reduces the
number<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> lymphocytes<00:01:49.590> reduces<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
number of lymphocytes reduces your

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.410 
number of lymphocytes reduces your
ability<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.659> flight<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.229> fight<00:01:52.409> infection

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
ability to in flight to fight infection

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
ability to in flight to fight infection
so<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.659> increase<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.259> antibody<00:01:55.770> production

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so be increase in antibody production

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
so be increase in antibody production
straight<00:01:56.460> away<00:01:56.640> no<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.240> even<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
straight away no we don't even need to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
straight away no we don't even need to
look<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> reduction<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.490> antibody

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
look at that see a reduction in antibody

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.209 
look at that see a reduction in antibody
production<00:02:00.270> yes<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.350> decrease<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.860> active

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
production yes and a decrease in active

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.039 
production yes and a decrease in active
little<00:02:02.579> sons<00:02:02.790> yes<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> sounds<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.840> right

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
little sons yes that sounds about right

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.469 
little sons yes that sounds about right
and<00:02:04.259> Dean<00:02:05.009> increase<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.790> antibody<00:02:06.210> production

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and Dean increase in antibody production

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
and Dean increase in antibody production
no<00:02:06.960> straight<00:02:07.350> away<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.770> wrong<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.489> know

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
no straight away it was wrong so we know

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.890 
no straight away it was wrong so we know
the<00:02:08.759> answer<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.090> C

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
the answer is C

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.240 
the answer is C
question<00:02:11.900> three<00:02:12.319> why<00:02:12.530> are<00:02:12.709> antibiotics

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
question three why are antibiotics

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.250 
question three why are antibiotics
effective<00:02:14.120> against<00:02:14.390> bacteria<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
effective against bacteria and I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.350 
effective against bacteria and I
actually<00:02:15.379> mentioned<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.610> previously<00:02:16.819> if

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
actually mentioned this previously if

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
actually mentioned this previously if
you're<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.659> listen<00:02:17.930> carefully<00:02:18.409> so<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.129> we<00:02:19.250> look

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
you're in listen carefully so if we look

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.339 
you're in listen carefully so if we look
through<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.730> four<00:02:20.420> ones<00:02:20.629> but<00:02:20.900> lots<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.170> them

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
through the four ones but lots of them

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.380 
through the four ones but lots of them
would<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.620> red<00:02:21.860> herring<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.250> seem<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
would be red herring that seem to be the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.640 
would be red herring that seem to be the
right<00:02:23.510> answer<00:02:23.569> if<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.170> don't<00:02:24.349> know<00:02:24.470> what

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
right answer if you don't know what

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.589 
right answer if you don't know what
you're<00:02:24.769> talking<00:02:25.069> about

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
you're talking about

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.470 
you're talking about
however<00:02:26.599> if<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.879> do<00:02:28.879> know<00:02:29.120> we're<00:02:29.269> talking

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
however if you do know we're talking

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.850 
however if you do know we're talking
about<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.870> know<00:02:30.019> which<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.560> correct

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
about you know which one the correct

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.080 
about you know which one the correct
answer<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> they<00:02:33.950> can<00:02:34.010> produce<00:02:34.250> specific

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
answer is so a they can produce specific

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.680 
answer is so a they can produce specific
antibodies<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:36.650> not<00:02:36.829> actually<00:02:37.040> why

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
antibodies so that's not actually why

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.729 
antibodies so that's not actually why
antibiotics<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:38.870> effective<00:02:39.500> against

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
antibiotics are effective against

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.000 
antibiotics are effective against
bacteria<00:02:39.799> this<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.730> actually<00:02:41.239> caused<00:02:41.930> by<00:02:42.010> B

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
bacteria this is actually caused by B

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.190 
bacteria this is actually caused by B
lymphocytes<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.209> let<00:02:44.510> being<00:02:44.750> lymphocytes

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
lymphocytes so let being lymphocytes

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.360 
lymphocytes so let being lymphocytes
produce<00:02:45.620> antibodies<00:02:46.160> against<00:02:46.700> back<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
produce antibodies against back to you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.220 
produce antibodies against back to you
okay<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.120> not<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.840> mean<00:02:50.900> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
okay so it's it's not a I mean it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.199 
okay so it's it's not a I mean it
definitely<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.739> reason<00:02:52.129> why<00:02:52.370> bacteria<00:02:53.000> can

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
definitely is a reason why bacteria can

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.119 
definitely is a reason why bacteria can
be<00:02:53.329> destroyed<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:54.319> not<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.739> reason<00:02:55.010> why

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
be destroyed but not the reason why

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.440 
be destroyed but not the reason why
antibiotics<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.209> specific<00:02:57.730> are<00:02:58.730> effective<00:02:59.180> so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
antibiotics in specific are effective so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.649 
antibiotics in specific are effective so
B<00:03:00.409> they<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.829> engulf<00:03:01.250> foreign<00:03:01.879> matter<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.450> know

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
B they can engulf foreign matter so know

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.180 
B they can engulf foreign matter so know
that<00:03:02.870> once<00:03:03.049> again<00:03:03.230> that's<00:03:03.440> incorrect<00:03:03.859> because

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
that once again that's incorrect because

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.160 
that once again that's incorrect because
we're<00:03:04.459> talking<00:03:04.790> about<00:03:04.900> when<00:03:05.900> we<00:03:05.989> talk<00:03:06.140> about

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
we're talking about when we talk about

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.660 
we're talking about when we talk about
golfing<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.129> think<00:03:07.310> about<00:03:07.489> eating

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
golfing you have to think about eating

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.039 
golfing you have to think about eating
eating<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.599> phagocytes<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.970> pac-man<00:03:11.359> gobbling

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
eating is phagocytes a pac-man gobbling

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.360 
eating is phagocytes a pac-man gobbling
up<00:03:12.170> small<00:03:12.620> things<00:03:12.730> okay<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.480> see<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:16.190> can

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
up small things okay so see they can

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.460 
up small things okay so see they can
block<00:03:16.579> specific<00:03:16.849> metabolic<00:03:17.419> pathways<00:03:18.079> yes

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
block specific metabolic pathways yes

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.080 
block specific metabolic pathways yes
that<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.919> correct<00:03:19.190> answer<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:19.880> talked

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
that is the correct answer we talked

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.819 
that is the correct answer we talked
about<00:03:20.239> how<00:03:20.480> they<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.840> block<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.560> specific

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
about how they can block a specific

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.670 
about how they can block a specific
specific<00:03:22.760> pathways<00:03:23.239> which<00:03:23.480> causes<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.139> either

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
specific pathways which causes to either

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
specific pathways which causes to either
the<00:03:25.040> bacteria<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.489> stay<00:03:25.760> still<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.660> they<00:03:26.750> don't

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the bacteria to stay still so they don't

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.229 
the bacteria to stay still so they don't
grow<00:03:27.139> very<00:03:27.169> much<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.889> body<00:03:28.069> can<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:29.030> kill

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
grow very much so the body can can kill

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.569 
grow very much so the body can can kill
them<00:03:29.389> or<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.560> bacteria<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.160> actually<00:03:31.459> get

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
them or the bacteria can actually get

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.640 
them or the bacteria can actually get
killed<00:03:31.910> by<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.239> bacteria<00:03:32.810> or<00:03:32.989> by<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:33.200> anti

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
killed by the bacteria or by the anti

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.860 
killed by the bacteria or by the anti
product<00:03:33.950> itself<00:03:34.250> they<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.120> act<00:03:35.269> as<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.450> vaccine

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
product itself they can act as a vaccine

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.409 
product itself they can act as a vaccine
no<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.500> incorrect<00:03:39.549> question<00:03:40.549> for<00:03:40.819> what

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
no that's incorrect question for what

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.089 
no that's incorrect question for what
effect<00:03:41.720> does<00:03:41.840> HIV<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.829> immune

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
effect does HIV have on the immune

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.699 
effect does HIV have on the immune
system<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:43.609> once<00:03:43.790> again<00:03:44.060> we've<00:03:44.209> got<00:03:44.239> HIV<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.530> if

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
system so once again we've got HIV so if

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.289 
system so once again we've got HIV so if
you<00:03:45.859> would<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.310> want<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.669> know<00:03:46.819> our<00:03:46.970> topic

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
you would not want to know our topic

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.360 
you would not want to know our topic
very<00:03:47.569> well<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.199> want<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.440> know<00:03:48.530> HIV<00:03:48.980> well

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
very well you want to know HIV well

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.250 
very well you want to know HIV well
remember<00:03:50.209> what<00:03:50.329> I<00:03:50.359> said<00:03:50.480> about<00:03:50.690> HIV

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
remember what I said about HIV

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.770 
remember what I said about HIV
everything<00:03:51.739> gets<00:03:51.859> suppressed<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.419> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
everything gets suppressed so a it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.300 
everything gets suppressed so a it
prevents<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.199> leukocytes<00:03:54.680> from<00:03:54.919> fighting

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
prevents the leukocytes from fighting

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.330 
prevents the leukocytes from fighting
bacteria<00:03:55.870> by<00:03:56.870> phagocytosis

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
bacteria by phagocytosis

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.159 
bacteria by phagocytosis
so<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:58.970> doesn't<00:03:59.239> really<00:03:59.359> have<00:03:59.599> any<00:03:59.720> effect<00:03:59.870> on

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
so you doesn't really have any effect on

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.050 
so you doesn't really have any effect on
leukocytes<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.949> be<00:04:01.069> honest<00:04:01.280> we're<00:04:02.030> not

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
leukocytes to be honest we're not

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.729 
leukocytes to be honest we're not
leukocytes<00:04:02.660> in<00:04:02.750> general<00:04:03.199> it's<00:04:03.349> more<00:04:03.560> about

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
leukocytes in general it's more about

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.740 
leukocytes in general it's more about
time<00:04:04.010> with<00:04:04.160> lymphocytes<00:04:04.730> but<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.419> know<00:04:05.510> let's

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
time with lymphocytes but you know let's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.210 
time with lymphocytes but you know let's
put<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:05.959> dot<00:04:06.169> next<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.769> see<00:04:06.919> if<00:04:06.980> we<00:04:07.069> can

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
put a dot next to it and see if we can

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.729 
put a dot next to it and see if we can
find<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.519> better<00:04:07.639> answer<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.690> causes<00:04:09.199> excessive

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
find a better answer it causes excessive

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.520 
find a better answer it causes excessive
production<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.760> leukocytes<00:04:11.269> no<00:04:12.019> because

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
production of leukocytes no because

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.439 
production of leukocytes no because
remember<00:04:12.769> everything<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.549> with<00:04:13.579> HIV<00:04:14.239> is

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
remember everything to do with HIV is

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.559 
remember everything to do with HIV is
about<00:04:14.720> down

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
about down

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.099 
about down
now<00:04:17.000> everything<00:04:18.000> goes<00:04:18.180> down<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:18.930> about

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
now everything goes down it's not about

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.279 
now everything goes down it's not about
more<00:04:19.579> see<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.820> destroys<00:04:21.180> antibodies<00:04:22.079> produced

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
more see it destroys antibodies produced

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.409 
more see it destroys antibodies produced
by<00:04:22.770> leukocytes<00:04:23.580> no<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.090> doesn't<00:04:24.330> actually

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
by leukocytes no it doesn't actually

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.170 
by leukocytes no it doesn't actually
destroy<00:04:25.310> antibodies<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.490> such<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.910> actually

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
destroy antibodies and such it actually

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.930 
destroy antibodies and such it actually
destroys<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.740> lymphocytes<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.789> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
destroys the the lymphocytes so the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.590 
destroys the the lymphocytes so the
cells<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.539> produce<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.110> antibodies<00:04:32.840> okay

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
cells that produce the antibodies okay

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.450 
cells that produce the antibodies okay
so<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:36.750> kind<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.960> like<00:04:37.110> say<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.590> someone<00:04:38.100> was

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so it's kind of like say if someone was

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.050 
so it's kind of like say if someone was
if<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.600> HIV<00:04:40.020> was<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:40.500> know<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:41.250> protesting

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
if the HIV was you know a protesting

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.719 
if the HIV was you know a protesting
group<00:04:42.270> they<00:04:42.479> wouldn't<00:04:42.919> they<00:04:43.919> close<00:04:44.400> down<00:04:44.580> the

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
group they wouldn't they close down the

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.790 
group they wouldn't they close down the
factory<00:04:44.759> they<00:04:45.509> don't<00:04:45.690> destroy<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.350> goods<00:04:46.620> of

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
factory they don't destroy the goods of

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.700 
factory they don't destroy the goods of
the<00:04:46.919> factory<00:04:47.280> itself<00:04:47.729> okay<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:49.050> D<00:04:49.259> it<00:04:49.500> lowers

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
the factory itself okay so D it lowers

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.409 
the factory itself okay so D it lowers
the<00:04:49.889> number<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.250> leukocytes<00:04:50.699> reducing

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
the number of leukocytes reducing

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.999 
the number of leukocytes reducing
antibody<00:04:51.900> production<00:04:52.229> uh-huh

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
antibody production uh-huh

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.860 
antibody production uh-huh
yes<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.430> correct<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.330> they<00:04:54.449> talked<00:04:54.660> about

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
yes that's correct so they talked about

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.749 
yes that's correct so they talked about
leukocytes<00:04:55.410> but<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:55.800> more<00:04:56.009> specifically<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
leukocytes but in more specifically the

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.279 
leukocytes but in more specifically the
total<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.419> should<00:04:57.840> be<00:04:57.930> talking<00:04:58.050> about

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
total I should be talking about

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.999 
total I should be talking about
lymphocytes<00:04:59.099> but<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.800> correct

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
lymphocytes but that is the correct

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.520 
lymphocytes but that is the correct
answer<00:05:05.539> there<00:05:06.539> are<00:05:06.660> plenty<00:05:06.840> more<00:05:07.020> YouTube
