00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
was something like eighty five percent
when<00:01:57.869> lost<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.079> more<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.290> your

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
when lost that's just a more of your

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.480 
when lost that's just a more of your
line<00:02:02.600> magic<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> mean<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> idea<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:05.070> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
line magic I mean the idea is just so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240 
line magic I mean the idea is just so
good<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.180> tanger<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
good so tanger really really is going to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.040 
good so tanger really really is going to
need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> step<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.239> actually<00:02:09.509> wants

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
need to step it up if he actually wants

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.470 
need to step it up if he actually wants
to<00:02:10.319> win<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> game<00:02:10.800> he<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.300> as

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
to win this game he is it going for as

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
to win this game he is it going for as
fast<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.080> spawning

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fast as spawning

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890 
fast as spawning
so<00:02:13.920> 14<00:02:14.370> gasps<00:02:14.520> working<00:02:14.940> pool<00:02:15.150> he<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so 14 gasps working pool he will have a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.710 
so 14 gasps working pool he will have a
link<00:02:16.290> speed<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.130> running<00:02:17.490> before<00:02:17.700> ADRE<00:02:18.300> so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
link speed up and running before ADRE so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.330 
link speed up and running before ADRE so
there<00:02:18.960> might<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.350> small<00:02:19.950> window<00:02:20.160> of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
there might be a small window of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
there might be a small window of
opportunity<00:02:20.520> where<00:02:21.620> he<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.770> actually

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
opportunity where he can actually

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.790 
opportunity where he can actually
exploit<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.580> Edra<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> known<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.320> his<00:02:25.530> games

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
exploit that Edra is known in his games

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.010 
exploit that Edra is known in his games
to<00:02:26.040> actually<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.820> specially<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.390> ladder<00:02:27.630> where

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
to actually go specially in ladder where

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
to actually go specially in ladder where
he's<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.410> playing<00:02:28.770> any<00:02:29.100> pros<00:02:29.880> or<00:02:30.410> full-time

he's not playing any pros or full-time

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.770 
he's not playing any pros or full-time
professional<00:02:32.520> starcraft<00:02:32.700> two<00:02:33.120> players<00:02:33.360> he

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
professional starcraft two players he

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
professional starcraft two players he
usually<00:02:33.990> goes<00:02:34.350> for<00:02:34.410> very<00:02:35.070> very<00:02:35.880> very

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800

aggressive aggressive economy style if

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
aggressive aggressive economy style if
you<00:02:41.400> haven't<00:02:41.640> watched<00:02:42.060> his<00:02:42.330> stream<00:02:42.750> he<00:02:43.170> really

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you haven't watched his stream he really

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
you haven't watched his stream he really
really<00:02:44.040> liked<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> enamel<00:02:45.000> early<00:02:45.300> game<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
really liked the enamel early game to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.050 
really liked the enamel early game to
get<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.959> economy<00:02:46.560> advantage<00:02:47.070> here<00:02:47.550> he<00:02:47.790> goes

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
get that economy advantage here he goes

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.570 
get that economy advantage here he goes
again<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.600> once<00:02:48.780> again<00:02:48.900> fast-expanding

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
again so once again fast-expanding

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.220 
again so once again fast-expanding
against<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.850> zerg<00:02:51.090> he<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.570> spot<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
against the zerg he will spot that the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.800 
against the zerg he will spot that the
expansion<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.370> jet<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.150> starting<00:02:54.570> from

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
expansion is jet now just starting from

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.350 
expansion is jet now just starting from
tang<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.470> he<00:02:55.709> will<00:02:55.890> immediately<00:02:56.070> drop<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.060> spine

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
tang so he will immediately drop a spine

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.060 
tang so he will immediately drop a spine
crawler<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.870> love<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.350> decision<00:02:58.860> by

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
crawler and I love this decision by

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.920 
crawler and I love this decision by
Indra<00:02:59.459> he<00:02:59.640> now<00:02:59.790> has<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.030> hundred<00:03:00.480> yeah<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.870> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
Indra he now has a hundred yeah so you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.770 
Indra he now has a hundred yeah so you
will<00:03:01.170> stop<00:03:01.470> mining<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.300> started<00:03:03.540> his

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
will stop mining it and it started his

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.990 
will stop mining it and it started his
link<00:03:04.110> speed<00:03:04.320> right<00:03:04.620> away<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.370> spine<00:03:05.700> crawler

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
link speed right away this spine crawler

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.060 
link speed right away this spine crawler
is<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.600> best<00:03:06.780> decision<00:03:07.290> ever<00:03:07.440> because<00:03:08.040> he

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
is the best decision ever because he

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.160 
is the best decision ever because he
knows<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.730> tank<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.300> actually<00:03:09.630> put<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
knows that tank can actually put on a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.800 
knows that tank can actually put on a
lot<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.440> pressure<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.360> here<00:03:12.360> he<00:03:12.600> actually

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
lot of pressure and here he actually

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.440 
lot of pressure and here he actually
comes<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.410> his<00:03:13.739> for<00:03:14.130> initial<00:03:14.760> links<00:03:15.060> they

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
comes with his for initial links they

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.670 
comes with his for initial links they
won't<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.810> able<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.110> do<00:03:16.230> too<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:16.620> damage

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
won't be able to do too much damage

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.000 
won't be able to do too much damage
because<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.519> reduce<00:03:18.260> for<00:03:19.260> llings<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.650> his<00:03:19.830> own

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
because it reduce for llings of his own

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.940 
because it reduce for llings of his own
so<00:03:20.280> he<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.580> looking<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.480> slight<00:03:22.380> lead<00:03:22.680> at

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so he is looking in a slight lead at

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
so he is looking in a slight lead at
this<00:03:23.130> point<00:03:23.400> although<00:03:23.580> tang<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.660> will<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.320> his

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
this point although tang I will have his

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.440 
this point although tang I will have his
expansion<00:03:25.980> right<00:03:26.250> after<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.970> doesn't

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
expansion right after this and doesn't

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.270 
expansion right after this and doesn't
have<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.750> spend<00:03:28.019> 100<00:03:28.440> minerals<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.040> spine

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
have to spend 100 minerals on that spine

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.460 
have to spend 100 minerals on that spine
crawler<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.940> will<00:03:30.120> try<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.420> run<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.959> here<00:03:31.230> see

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
crawler you will try and run up here see

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.870 
crawler you will try and run up here see
that<00:03:31.620> there<00:03:31.799> is<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.920> spine<00:03:32.250> crawler<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.670> just

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
that there is a spine crawler and just

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.810 
that there is a spine crawler and just
stay<00:03:33.360> out<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.989> way<00:03:34.170> for<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:34.830> his<00:03:35.370> link

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
stay out of the way for now his link

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.850 
stay out of the way for now his link
speed<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.269> almost<00:03:36.540> finished<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.080> look<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.650> him

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
speed is almost finished to look for him

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.949 
speed is almost finished to look for him
to<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.130> abuse<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.239> because<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> will

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to actually abuse that because it will

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.699 
to actually abuse that because it will
be<00:03:39.989> ever<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.120> slightly<00:03:42.120> before<00:03:42.420> ages<00:03:43.170> idris<00:03:43.530> is

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
be ever so slightly before ages idris is

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.840 
be ever so slightly before ages idris is
about<00:03:44.040> 50<00:03:44.459> seconds<00:03:44.940> away<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.230> where

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
about 50 seconds away so here is where

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.490 
about 50 seconds away so here is where
tank<00:03:47.850> can<00:03:48.060> actually<00:03:48.360> exploit<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.230> speed

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
tank can actually exploit at this speed

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.560 
tank can actually exploit at this speed

a day and say he's in a session and he
really<00:05:23.880> wants<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.240> practice<00:05:24.420> his<00:05:25.110> late

really wants to practice his late

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.280 
really wants to practice his late
gainsbourg<00:05:26.160> well<00:05:26.730> if<00:05:26.940> he<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.780> going<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.080> gear

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
gainsbourg well if he is going to gear

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.650 
gainsbourg well if he is going to gear
up<00:05:28.320> obviously<00:05:28.650> for<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> late<00:05:29.700> game<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.090> if<00:05:30.210> this

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
up obviously for a late game and if this

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.150 
up obviously for a late game and if this
happens<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:32.160> do<00:05:32.610> think<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.510> might<00:05:34.160> pass

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
happens I do think that this might pass

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.060 
happens I do think that this might pass
as<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.520> waste<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.120> his<00:05:36.450> time<00:05:36.930> at<00:05:37.380> this<00:05:37.590> point<00:05:37.860> on

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
as a waste of his time at this point on

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.470 
as a waste of his time at this point on
the<00:05:38.190> ladder<00:05:38.400> if<00:05:38.610> she<00:05:38.730> really<00:05:38.910> wants<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.360> go

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
the ladder if she really wants to go

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.750

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
particular build if your opponent

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.000 
particular build if your opponent
doesn't<00:05:44.130> respond<00:05:44.730> the<00:05:44.940> way<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.150> want<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:46.010> for

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
doesn't respond the way you want to for

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.010 
doesn't respond the way you want to for
that<00:05:47.220> practice<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.910> mean<00:05:48.180> mind<00:05:48.480> as<00:05:48.600> well<00:05:48.780> just

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
that practice I mean mind as well just

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.370 
that practice I mean mind as well just
quit<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:50.310> other<00:05:50.850> option<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.900> other<00:05:52.080> reason

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
quit the other option the other reason

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.340 
quit the other option the other reason
why<00:05:52.710> adre<00:05:53.160> might<00:05:53.400> do<00:05:53.940> this<00:05:54.120> obviously<00:05:54.810> rage<00:05:55.110> is

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
why adre might do this obviously rage is

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.110 
why adre might do this obviously rage is
one<00:05:55.530> of<00:05:55.650> them<00:05:55.770> that<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.430> most<00:05:56.610> popular

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
one of them that is the most popular

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.790 
one of them that is the most popular
because<00:05:57.360> that's<00:05:57.780> what<00:05:58.020> we'd<00:05:58.200> love<00:05:58.410> to<00:05:58.620> see

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
because that's what we'd love to see

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.400 
because that's what we'd love to see
from<00:05:58.830> ADRE<00:05:59.430> but<00:06:00.270> obviously<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.960> second

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
from ADRE but obviously the second

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.590 
from ADRE but obviously the second
reason<00:06:01.530> could<00:06:02.190> be<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.370> he<00:06:02.850> really<00:06:03.150> doesn't

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
reason could be that he really doesn't

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.660 
reason could be that he really doesn't
want<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:04.110> waste<00:06:04.260> his<00:06:04.500> energy<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:05.190> deal<00:06:05.490> with

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
want to waste his energy to deal with

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.970 
want to waste his energy to deal with
this<00:06:05.790> we<00:06:06.030> have<00:06:06.210> seen<00:06:06.510> this<00:06:07.020> kind<00:06:07.350> of<00:06:07.410> rage<00:06:07.650> quit

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
this we have seen this kind of rage quit

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.080 
this we have seen this kind of rage quit
in<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.400> big<00:06:08.610> tournaments<00:06:09.210> from<00:06:09.570> Adria<00:06:10.020> and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
in the big tournaments from Adria and

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.520 
in the big tournaments from Adria and
the<00:06:12.090> reason<00:06:12.420> for<00:06:12.450> that<00:06:12.630> is<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:12.960> if<00:06:13.320> you're

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
the reason for that is that if you're

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.190 
the reason for that is that if you're
going<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.740> play<00:06:14.040> a<00:06:14.280> 30<00:06:15.090> minute<00:06:15.360> long<00:06:15.660> game<00:06:15.990> it

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
going to play a 30 minute long game it

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.830 
going to play a 30 minute long game it
is<00:06:16.440> exhausting<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:17.580> player<00:06:17.910> and<00:06:18.240> it<00:06:18.510> really

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
is exhausting for player and it really

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.430 
is exhausting for player and it really
feels<00:06:19.200> like<00:06:19.320> we<00:06:19.920> won<00:06:20.550> again<00:06:21.180> I<00:06:21.540> speculate<00:06:22.170> here

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
feels like we won again I speculate here

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.110 
feels like we won again I speculate here
but<00:06:22.560> I<00:06:22.620> really<00:06:22.980> think<00:06:23.160> that<00:06:23.280> he<00:06:23.520> feels<00:06:23.820> that<00:06:24.060> he

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
but I really think that he feels that he

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.020 
but I really think that he feels that he
is<00:06:24.420> playing<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.410> lot<00:06:25.920> better<00:06:26.130> when<00:06:26.400> he's<00:06:26.640> fresh

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
is playing a lot better when he's fresh

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.970 
is playing a lot better when he's fresh
then<00:06:27.360> when<00:06:27.630> he's<00:06:27.840> exhausted<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.620> that<00:06:28.770> other

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
then when he's exhausted and that other

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.520 
then when he's exhausted and that other
players<00:06:29.400> might<00:06:29.730> have<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.150> edge<00:06:30.360> and<00:06:30.750> maybe

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
players might have the edge and maybe

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.620 
players might have the edge and maybe
more<00:06:31.920> endurance<00:06:32.460> in<00:06:32.670> him<00:06:32.880> so<00:06:33.090> if<00:06:33.240> he<00:06:33.270> feels

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
more endurance in him so if he feels

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.930 
more endurance in him so if he feels
that<00:06:33.780> that<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.230> one<00:06:34.500> of<00:06:34.650> his<00:06:34.800> weaknesses<00:06:35.460> he<00:06:35.760> is

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
that that is one of his weaknesses he is

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.420 
that that is one of his weaknesses he is
actually<00:06:36.240> justified<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.560> rage<00:06:37.830> quit<00:06:38.160> like

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
actually justified to rage quit like
