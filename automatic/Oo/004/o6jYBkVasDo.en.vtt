way<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> icon<00:00:17.670> from<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.910> game<00:00:18.210> on

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
way this is the icon from my game on

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.080 
way this is the icon from my game on
monster<00:00:19.710> part<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> app<00:00:20.250> store<00:00:20.279> that's<00:00:20.939> the

exact icon so I'm going to show you how

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.779 
exact icon so I'm going to show you how
I<00:00:23.369> did<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.939> one<00:00:24.289> um<00:00:25.289> called<00:00:25.980> 12<00:00:26.310> thumb<00:00:26.580> that's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
I did this one um called 12 thumb that's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.660 
I did this one um called 12 thumb that's
a<00:00:26.939> character<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:28.199> hyper<00:00:28.560> nerves<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
a character and it's hyper nerves and a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.389 
a character and it's hyper nerves and a
polygon<00:00:30.480> model<00:00:30.840> link<00:00:31.969> close<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.250> this<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

object<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:56.989> okay<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.559> sure<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.100> window

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
object um okay and make sure the window

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
object um okay and make sure the window
you<00:00:59.789> are<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> standard<00:01:00.600> mode<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you are on the standard mode in the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.799 
you are on the standard mode in the
layout<00:01:01.460> because<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
layout because then you have this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800 
layout because then you have this
material<00:01:04.409> window<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> left<00:01:05.820> bottom<00:01:06.479> side

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
material window on the left bottom side

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
material window on the left bottom side
of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.680> screen<00:01:08.630> file<00:01:10.549> I'm<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of the your screen file I'm going to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460 
of the your screen file I'm going to
create<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> new<00:01:12.060> material<00:01:12.360> double<00:01:13.229> click<00:01:13.290> on

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
create a new material double click on

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
create a new material double click on
the<00:01:13.530> material<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:15.000> change<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> color

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the material and then change the color

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
the material and then change the color
too<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.470> course<00:01:16.979> green<00:01:17.210> then<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
too of course green then go to the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.010 
too of course green then go to the
reflection<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.810> sign<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
reflection and just sign like a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010 
reflection and just sign like a
five-person<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> reflection<00:01:23.810> brightness<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
five-person of reflection brightness to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
five-person of reflection brightness to
the<00:01:25.049> reflection<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.360> then<00:01:27.360> change<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> name

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the reflection and then change the name

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
the reflection and then change the name
through<00:01:28.560> green<00:01:29.630> okay<00:01:31.189> then<00:01:32.189> i'm<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
through green okay then i'm going to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
through green okay then i'm going to
create<00:01:32.939> another<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.570> material<00:01:34.110> um<00:01:34.460> double

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
create another in material um double

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
create another in material um double
click<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.409> pink<00:01:37.409> oh<00:01:38.689> I'm<00:01:39.689> sorry<00:01:39.990> you

click on that and pink oh I'm sorry you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
click on that and pink oh I'm sorry you
go<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.920> sure<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
go you make sure that you're on the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.069 
go you make sure that you're on the
color<00:01:42.020> nothing<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> reflections<00:01:43.710> first

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
color nothing the reflections first

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.280 
color nothing the reflections first
color<00:01:46.340> change<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.970> pink<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
color change that to pink and then go to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840 
color change that to pink and then go to
the<00:01:49.409> reflection<00:01:50.070> i'm<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> change<00:01:50.610> this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the reflection i'm going to change this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.840 
the reflection i'm going to change this
one<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.250> grey<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
one back to what it was like grey and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.950 
one back to what it was like grey and
then<00:01:57.469> have<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> reflection<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.689> maybe<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
then have the reflection on maybe like a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.310 
then have the reflection on maybe like a
little<00:02:01.200> bit<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.469> lighter<00:02:01.680> color<00:02:02.119> without

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320

homework<00:02:07.320> forgot<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> rename<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.780> pink<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
homework forgot to rename it do pink and

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.840 
homework forgot to rename it do pink and
now<00:02:12.629> i'm<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
now i'm going to do the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.570 
now i'm going to do the
map<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.360> eye<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:15.550> file<00:02:16.550> new<00:02:17.200> material<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.980 

let<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.610> come<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.060> color<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.960> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
let it come to the color with the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.140 
let it come to the color with the
texture<00:02:24.620> double<00:02:25.160> click<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.670> then<00:02:26.090> I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
texture double click here and then I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.080
