00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.500 
acts and today's tutorial is gonna be a
little<00:00:33.010> shorter<00:00:33.400> that's<00:00:33.670> because<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.180> not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
little shorter that's because it's not

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.250 
little shorter that's because it's not
the<00:00:34.809> most<00:00:34.989> useful<00:00:35.850> technique<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.239> as<00:00:37.870> a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
the most useful technique and as a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.410 
the most useful technique and as a
warning<00:00:38.770> it's<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:39.010> little<00:00:39.250> bit<00:00:39.370> gross<00:00:39.699> so<00:00:40.270> if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
warning it's a little bit gross so if

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.869 
warning it's a little bit gross so if
you<00:00:40.570> don't<00:00:40.750> like<00:00:40.930> hearing<00:00:41.379> about<00:00:41.680> saliva<00:00:42.520> and

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
you don't like hearing about saliva and

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.180 
you don't like hearing about saliva and
spit<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.660> things<00:00:43.900> like<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.890> might<00:00:45.040> now

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
spit and things like that you might now

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.490 
spit and things like that you might now
want<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.489> watch<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.850> rest<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.410> if

saliva because we play wind instruments
where<00:00:55.840> when<00:00:56.290> we're<00:00:56.440> blowing<00:00:56.829> air<00:00:57.010> in<00:00:57.190> just<00:00:57.399> the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
where when we're blowing air in just the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.700 
where when we're blowing air in just the
condensation<00:00:58.030> alone<00:00:58.420> will<00:00:58.750> get<00:00:58.870> wet<00:00:59.140> but<00:00:59.410> yes

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
condensation alone will get wet but yes

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
any sax player of course is used to this

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.100 
any sax player of course is used to this
thing<00:01:09.060> where<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.360> course<00:01:10.600> suck<00:01:10.810> out<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
thing where we of course suck out the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.859 
thing where we of course suck out the
saliva<00:01:11.759> so<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:12.970> have<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.119> good<00:01:13.270> clean<00:01:13.600> tone

saliva so that we have a good clean tone
when<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.140> play<00:01:14.380> because<00:01:14.619> just<00:01:14.800> playing

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
when we play because just playing

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.279 
when we play because just playing
normally<00:01:15.340> will<00:01:15.910> have<00:01:16.149> some<00:01:16.360> build<00:01:16.539> up<00:01:16.660> so<00:01:17.229> you

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
normally will have some build up so you

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.529 
normally will have some build up so you
might<00:01:17.619> be<00:01:17.649> asking<00:01:18.160> Derrick<00:01:18.850> why<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.090> heck<00:01:19.390> are

you talking about blowing into the horn
and<00:01:22.600> adding<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:24.009> saliva<00:01:25.709> when<00:01:26.709> I'm<00:01:26.860> trying

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
and adding this saliva when I'm trying

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.919 
and adding this saliva when I'm trying
to<00:01:27.399> get<00:01:27.550> rid<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.819> well<00:01:28.270> that's<00:01:28.420> because<00:01:28.630> I

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
to get rid of it well that's because I

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.650 
to get rid of it well that's because I
just<00:01:29.590> thought<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.670> would<00:01:30.789> be<00:01:30.910> fun<00:01:31.179> to<00:01:31.420> kind<00:01:31.600> of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
just thought it would be fun to kind of

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.029 
just thought it would be fun to kind of
make<00:01:31.810> an<00:01:31.929> effect<00:01:32.259> where<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.679> kind<00:01:32.979> of

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
make an effect where it's kind of

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.040 
make an effect where it's kind of
sounding<00:01:33.429> like<00:01:33.550> static<00:01:34.179> when<00:01:34.630> I'm<00:01:34.750> playing

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
sounding like static when I'm playing

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.559 
sounding like static when I'm playing
the<00:01:35.200> horn<00:01:35.470> kind<00:01:35.709> of<00:01:35.770> I'm<00:01:35.890> imagining<00:01:36.479> hearing<00:01:37.479> a

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
the horn kind of I'm imagining hearing a

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.870 
the horn kind of I'm imagining hearing a
saxophone<00:01:38.080> through<00:01:38.319> an<00:01:38.410> old<00:01:38.530> radio<00:01:38.979> maybe

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
saxophone through an old radio maybe

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.930 
saxophone through an old radio maybe
where<00:01:40.119> there's<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:42.009> bad<00:01:42.220> signal<00:01:42.819> and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
where there's there's a bad signal and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.999 
where there's there's a bad signal and
so<00:01:43.000> it's<00:01:43.119> just<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.360> really<00:01:43.599> staticky<00:01:44.560> old

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
so it's just this really staticky old

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.699 
so it's just this really staticky old
kind<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.459> cracking<00:01:46.060> horn<00:01:46.720> almost<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.619> an

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
kind of cracking horn almost like an

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.059 
kind of cracking horn almost like an
electronic<00:01:48.310> effect<00:01:49.289> but<00:01:50.289> on<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.410> saxophone<00:01:50.709> in

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
electronic effect but on a saxophone in

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.550 
electronic effect but on a saxophone in
an<00:01:51.190> acoustic<00:01:51.399> environment<00:01:52.319> so<00:01:53.319> that's<00:01:53.410> what

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
an acoustic environment so that's what

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.820 
an acoustic environment so that's what
I'm<00:01:53.649> trying<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:53.950> do<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:54.550> once<00:01:55.479> again<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:56.649> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
I'm trying to do here once again not the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.219 
I'm trying to do here once again not the
most<00:01:57.009> useful<00:01:57.250> thing<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:58.000> little<00:01:58.300> bit<00:01:58.390> silly<00:01:58.660> but

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
most useful thing a little bit silly but

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.169 
most useful thing a little bit silly but
hey<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.530> haven't<00:01:59.920> seen<00:02:00.190> any<00:02:00.429> other<00:02:00.550> videos<00:02:00.940> on

there<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.920> find<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.580> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> hold

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
there I find that if you kind of hold

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
there I find that if you kind of hold
your<00:02:21.270> tongue<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.930> little<00:02:22.140> bit<00:02:22.230> higher<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
your tongue up a little bit higher to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.530 
your tongue up a little bit higher to
the<00:02:22.650> reeds<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.430> moisture<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.030> interact

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the reeds so that moisture can interact

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.740 
the reeds so that moisture can interact
with<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.950> tip<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.310> reed<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:27.270> will

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
with the the tip of the reed that will

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.050 
with the the tip of the reed that will
also<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.200> effective<00:02:28.920> now<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> things

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
also be effective now one of the things

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.510 
also be effective now one of the things
you<00:02:30.990> may<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.260> already<00:02:31.410> found<00:02:32.100> out<00:02:32.340> when

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
you may have already found out when

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.590 
you may have already found out when
you're<00:02:32.640> playing<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.940> saxophone<00:02:33.240> if<00:02:33.480> you've

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
you're playing the saxophone if you've

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.300 
you're playing the saxophone if you've
ever<00:02:33.750> tried<00:02:33.990> playing<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.530> your<00:02:34.680> back<00:02:34.950> laying

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
ever tried playing on your back laying

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.240 
ever tried playing on your back laying
down<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> saxophone<00:02:36.710> way<00:02:37.710> up<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
down with the saxophone way up like that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.490 
down with the saxophone way up like that
you<00:02:39.150> may<00:02:39.300> notice<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.660> your<00:02:39.900> sound<00:02:40.170> gets<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you may notice that your sound gets a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.190 
you may notice that your sound gets a
little<00:02:40.620> bit<00:02:40.800> speedier<00:02:41.300> extra<00:02:42.300> speedier<00:02:42.750> when

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
little bit speedier extra speedier when

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.940 
little bit speedier extra speedier when
you're<00:02:43.320> doing<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.770> just

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
you're doing that and that's just

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.490 
you're doing that and that's just
because<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> saliva<00:02:44.840> can't<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:46.050> down<00:02:46.230> through

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
because the saliva can't go down through

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.450 
because the saliva can't go down through
the<00:02:46.590> rest<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> horn<00:02:47.100> like<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> usually

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the rest of the horn like it usually

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.580 
the rest of the horn like it usually
does<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.240> kind<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> stays<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:49.230> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
does it just kind of stays there and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
does it just kind of stays there and
kind<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.830> moves<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> tip<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
kind of moves around on the tip of the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.750 
kind of moves around on the tip of the
reed<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.740> actually<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.490> kind<00:02:53.700> of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
reed and so actually if you do kind of

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.310 
reed and so actually if you do kind of
lean<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.300> little<00:02:54.600> bit<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.050> get<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
lean back a little bit you can get that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.350 
lean back a little bit you can get that
staticky<00:02:55.890> sound<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.580> last<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.060> little<00:02:57.210> longer

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
staticky sound to last a little longer

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.290 
staticky sound to last a little longer
of<00:02:58.290> course<00:02:58.590> who<00:02:59.220> wants<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.880> last<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
of course who wants that to last the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.330 
of course who wants that to last the
whole<00:03:00.330> time<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.900> don't<00:03:01.050> know<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.190> an

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
whole time I don't know it's just an

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.700

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
that maybe kind of using this as like

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.170 
that maybe kind of using this as like
kind<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.810> doing<00:03:10.110> long<00:03:10.470> tones<00:03:10.920> or<00:03:11.280> pads<00:03:11.610> when

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of want an eerie kind of sound maybe on

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.960 
of want an eerie kind of sound maybe on
the<00:03:16.260> intro<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.800> piece<00:03:17.070> that's<00:03:17.670> where<00:03:17.910> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
the intro of a piece that's where you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.180 
the intro of a piece that's where you
could<00:03:18.120> maybe<00:03:18.270> use<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.690> hopefully<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.830> crowd

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
could maybe use this hopefully the crowd

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.310 
could maybe use this hopefully the crowd
listening<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> will<00:03:21.450> will<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.170> of

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
listening to you will will think of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.850 
listening to you will will think of
static<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.160> they<00:03:23.250> won't<00:03:23.430> think<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.850> spit<00:03:24.860> but

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
static and they won't think of spit but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.440 
static and they won't think of spit but
whatever<00:03:26.100> that's<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.459> risk<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:26.940> take<00:03:27.180> as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
whatever that's the risk that we take as

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.440 
whatever that's the risk that we take as
performers<00:03:27.989> sometimes<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.640> here's<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.180> some

performers sometimes so here's just some

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.940 
performers sometimes so here's just some
examples<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.110> me<00:03:31.230> doing<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.530> maybe<00:03:31.770> with

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
examples of me doing this maybe with

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.940 
examples of me doing this maybe with
different<00:03:31.980> levels<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.810> moisture<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
different levels of moisture in the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.260 
different levels of moisture in the
mouthpiece<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.489> here's<00:03:35.670> just<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.940> little<00:03:36.209> bit

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
mouthpiece so here's just a little bit

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.990 
mouthpiece so here's just a little bit
Hey

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.390 

so<00:03:45.720> there<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.020> might<00:03:46.590> sound<00:03:46.830> like<00:03:47.010> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
so there that might sound like a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.170 
so there that might sound like a
beginning<00:03:48.390> sax<00:03:48.780> player<00:03:49.110> who<00:03:49.350> hasn't<00:03:49.590> done

hasn't learned to do that yet and
they're<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.620> kind<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.920> little<00:03:53.130> bit<00:03:53.280> of

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
they're just kind of a little bit of
