00:00:00.953 --> 00:00:01.953
 Hello and welcome. 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.869
 Let me introduce the ŠKODA Octavia Scout 4x4. 

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:12.173
 This vehicle is a truly proven driver, ready for country roads. 

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:17.676
 In this version, this feeling is underlined by protective arches and fenders. 

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.204
 And of course, it is increased by 30 millimeters. 

00:00:20.707 --> 00:00:23.280
 And today we see them in Denim Blue 

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:27.263
 with exclusive 17-inch wheels and chrome details. 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.790
 Well, let's look inside. 

00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:37.122
 The interior is decorated with Alcantara leather 

00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:40.793
 also includes a steering wheel with multifunction keys, 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.599
 and heated electric seats. 

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:46.300
 But one of the biggest improvements 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.409
 is a four-wheel drive with Haldex clutch 5. 

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:55.480
 So I would say that along with increased brightness 

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.911
 Scout is a great all-rounder. 

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:02.958
 And this is something completely new! 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.520
 For the first time 

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.466
 Škoda introduces the Octavia G-TEC with natural gas engine. 

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:17.180
 It greatly increases range to 1330 km using combined tanks. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.200
 And so it protects nature. 

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.900
 These are the Škoda cars from the Monte Carlo family. 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.250
 The style of this line is inspired by the exciting world of motorsport. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.238
 But let's take a close look! 

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.165
 Here's a Škoda Rapid Spaceback. 

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.228
 This vehicle has a unique design, but it is even more sporty now. 

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.140
 You see the black roof and the seventeen-inch black Savio wheels. 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.289
 Let's go inside. 

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:56.340
 Again, the black interior sports seats with steel details 

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.375
 and of course the steering wheel with red stitches is also worth mentioning. 

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:04.589
 It's a leather, super sport edition. Beautiful feeling, right? 

00:02:10.093 --> 00:02:15.293
 Now let's take a look at the true highlight of Skoda, Vision C. 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.059
 The five-door coupe is a look into the future of Skoda cars. 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.133
 As you can see, the design still follows the traditional lines, 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.850
 but it pushes their dynamics forward. 

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:30.122
 Rear lights still follow the typical C-design of today's Skoda cars 

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:33.307
 and embedded crystal resembles Czech craft. 

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.296
 If you like performance, you'll love this. 

00:02:44.974 --> 00:02:51.174
 The powerful 2.0 TSI engine will shoot you more than 200 miles per hour. 

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:52.917
 Come and sit down! 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.320
 And here's the magic RS button that lets you switch between driving modes. 

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:07.908
 Sports tuning continues with a leather three-spoke steering wheel 

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:12.230
 and specially designed red stitching sports seats. 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.850
 And now I'll show you something. 

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:20.160
 As you can see, red brake calipers 

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:26.762
 and the double chrome exhaust is proud to show off. 

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:33.395
 So, these are new Skoda cars - beautiful, powerful and simply smart. 

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:39.150
