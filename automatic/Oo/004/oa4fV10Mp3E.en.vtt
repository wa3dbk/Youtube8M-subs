00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.410
 and come on this opportunity I'm going to define a video tutorial to face 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.969
 as the narcotics hopefully and actors 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.659
 the values ​​go of asturias run comedians 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.469
 they are values ​​to win 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.409
 for this exercise 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.829
 I have put a house this text 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.939
 with the name houses 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.550
 and with the text property 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.560
 bagis 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.810
 the name the button 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.210
 random and caspian to the reader let's program we were going to say what 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.740
 LOL 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.020
 a cap 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.480
 It will be the same 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.910
 to the function that benedetti means rando 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.140
 we are asking for thorium I have a number to the asad 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.170
 when clicking 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 we see that these values ​​bancolombia 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.160
 as we can observe 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 this salazar value will allow us 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.800
 work between the bank 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.280
 February 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.500
 let's modify this range 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.190
 let's say what we want a unique sound 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 but by the mud of 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.240
 in this case 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.480
 when executing 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.450
 we are already getting 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.260
 a value of the houses 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 between the stride said 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 if we wanted for the range of ekin we would only multiply by 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.440
 and so began something that we need 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 how to eliminate them 10a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.780
 to eliminate decimals we use the inc function 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.170
 parenthesis 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 you get by entering mix percent 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.210
 inter comes from the word intel already 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.410
 type of data 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.810
 in theater 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.150
 we click 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 and we're going to get a random value now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.940
 quintero 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.470
 70 53 57 28 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.010
 cgt please what happens when we run again 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.479
 70 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.879
 53 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.139
 57 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.139
 we run again 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.309
 70 53 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:28.939
 57 ntx in this case we are getting the same values ​​at random 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:34.199
 so that the machine selects different colors we use the 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.339
 fernando mafé function 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.679
 2006 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.129
 we execute 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.129
 and now 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.219
 when clicking the machine get a different value 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.529
 fraga execution 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.999
 a clear example 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.169
 you have to work with values ​​of chance 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.349
 are the scores of the famous cargo 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.349
 in which plain and simple at the end of the song 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.249
 the machine rack number randomly and presents it as head of the score 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.279
 court
