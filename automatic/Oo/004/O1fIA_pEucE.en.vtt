00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.040 
so I'm sorry about a little fuzzies but
I<00:05:57.640> think<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.240> hidden<00:05:58.480> far<00:05:58.600> electric

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
I think it is hidden far electric

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.270 
I think it is hidden far electric
because<00:05:59.230> that<00:05:59.350> was<00:05:59.440> pretty<00:05:59.620> cool<00:05:59.950> and<00:06:00.130> it's

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
because that was pretty cool and it's

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.540 
because that was pretty cool and it's
really<00:06:00.460> useful<00:06:00.940> it's

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
really useful it's

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.510 
really useful it's
amended<00:06:01.820> me<00:06:01.940> her<00:06:02.480> it<00:06:03.020> made<00:06:03.980> it<00:06:04.100> so<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.250> didn't

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
amended me her it made it so I didn't

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.270 
amended me her it made it so I didn't
really<00:06:04.850> need<00:06:04.970> an<00:06:05.150> electrical<00:06:06.070> now<00:06:07.070> if<00:06:07.130> it

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
really need an electrical now if it

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.160 
really need an electrical now if it
feels<00:06:07.520> overly<00:06:07.910> powerful<00:06:08.240> but<00:06:08.750> we<00:06:08.930> still

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
feels overly powerful but we still

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.040 
feels overly powerful but we still
