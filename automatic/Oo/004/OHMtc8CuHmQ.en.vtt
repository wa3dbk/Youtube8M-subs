and then it will glue to the other tree

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.309 
and then it will glue to the other tree
I'll<00:01:58.520> just<00:01:58.819> press<00:01:59.090> those<00:01:59.390> two<00:01:59.630> sides<00:01:59.959> there

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
I'll just press those two sides there

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.249 
I'll just press those two sides there
and<00:02:02.080> then<00:02:03.080> just<00:02:03.349> like<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.560> you've<00:02:04.069> made<00:02:04.459> a

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and then just like that you've made a

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.690 
and then just like that you've made a
three-dimensional<00:02:06.259> angel<00:02:06.830> see<00:02:07.280> your<00:02:07.459> wings

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
are in the back and then she's going to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.460 
are in the back and then she's going to
fold<00:02:09.979> flat<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.759> tree<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.840> we're<00:02:12.290> ready

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
fold flat with the tree and we're ready

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.790 
fold flat with the tree and we're ready
to<00:02:12.560> put<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.950> inside<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.430> card
