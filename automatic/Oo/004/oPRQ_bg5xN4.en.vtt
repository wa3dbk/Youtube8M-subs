today<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:02.159> have<00:00:02.190> rampage<00:00:03.000> for<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.570> sega

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
today we have rampage for the sega

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.260 
today we have rampage for the sega
master<00:00:04.080> system<00:00:04.580> one<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.790> things<00:00:05.940> i<00:00:06.240> really

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
master system one of the things i really

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.600 
master system one of the things i really
like<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:07.049> sega<00:00:07.379> did<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:07.980> Master<00:00:08.400> System

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
like that sega did for the Master System

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.440 
like that sega did for the Master System
in<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.570> Genesis<00:00:10.110> was<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.010> put<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.940> games<00:00:12.210> in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
in the Genesis was to put the games in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.129 
in the Genesis was to put the games in
such<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> nice<00:00:13.080> case<00:00:13.820> it's<00:00:14.820> nice<00:00:15.150> having<00:00:15.660> an<00:00:15.780> in

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
such a nice case it's nice having an in

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.019 
such a nice case it's nice having an in
the<00:00:16.500> case<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> nice<00:00:17.730> case

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the case like that it's a nice case

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
the case like that it's a nice case
storm<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.410> more<00:00:19.619> importantly<00:00:20.250> when<00:00:20.939> people

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
storm but more importantly when people

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.769 
storm but more importantly when people
originally<00:00:22.020> bought<00:00:22.230> these<00:00:22.500> games<00:00:23.300> we<00:00:24.300> tended

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
originally bought these games we tended

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.650 
originally bought these games we tended
to<00:00:24.960> keep<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> case<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:26.039> since<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.939> were<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to keep the case in since they were so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
to keep the case in since they were so
nice<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.500> meant<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.010> also<00:00:29.189> kept<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
nice which meant that they also kept the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
nice which meant that they also kept the
man<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.960> today<00:00:31.320> when<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.830> collect<00:00:32.189> for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
man you so today when you collect for

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
man you so today when you collect for
the<00:00:32.700> sega<00:00:32.969> master<00:00:33.239> system<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the sega master system and for the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770 
the sega master system and for the
genesis<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.880> find<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> much<00:00:36.480> higher

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
genesis you find a much higher

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.250 
genesis you find a much higher
percentage<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.620> gains<00:00:38.149> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> case<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
percentage of gains in the case with the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.010 
percentage of gains in the case with the
men<00:00:41.030> certainly<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.300> find<00:00:42.600> some<00:00:42.840> loose

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
men certainly you find some loose

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.830 
men certainly you find some loose
cartridges<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.340> nearly<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.390> extent

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
cartridges but not nearly to the extent

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
cartridges but not nearly to the extent
that<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.260> find<00:00:46.530> loose<00:00:47.219> cartridges<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that you find loose cartridges for the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
that you find loose cartridges for the
Nintendo<00:00:48.840> systems<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> Atari

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
Nintendo systems are for the Atari

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.770 
Nintendo systems are for the Atari
systems<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> makes<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.850> nicer<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> collect

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
systems so it makes it nicer to collect

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
systems so it makes it nicer to collect
today<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:56.960> just<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.190> game<00:00:59.879> recently<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
today I just got this game recently and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290 
today I just got this game recently and
I'd<00:01:01.289> never<00:01:01.590> paid<00:01:01.890> rampage<00:01:02.430> before<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'd never paid rampage before I got it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
I'd never paid rampage before I got it
so<00:01:04.260> I'm<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.309> overly<00:01:06.000> proficient

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so I'm not going to be overly proficient

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.760 
so I'm not going to be overly proficient
at<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.939> me<00:01:09.260> perhaps<00:01:10.260> jumping

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
at it so if you see me perhaps jumping

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.990 
at it so if you see me perhaps jumping
off<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> building<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> should<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:11.880> been

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
off the building when I should have been

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
off the building when I should have been
punching<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> photon<00:01:13.380> field

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
punching because that the photon field

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.840 
punching because that the photon field
problem<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> game<00:01:16.850> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
problem that's just me not the game it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
problem that's just me not the game it's
also<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.750> particular<00:01:19.220> exactly<00:01:20.220> where

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
also a little particular exactly where

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
also a little particular exactly where
you're<00:01:20.580> standing<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> able<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> climb<00:01:22.409> up

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you're standing to be able to climb up

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.429 
you're standing to be able to climb up
the<00:01:22.799> game<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> huge<00:01:24.930> problem<00:01:25.409> with

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the game that's not a huge problem with

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.830 
the game that's not a huge problem with
the<00:01:25.650> controls<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.700> taking<00:01:27.689> me<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the controls it's just taking me a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
the controls it's just taking me a
little<00:01:28.020> while<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> used<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.759> had<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
little while to get used to it I had a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
little while to get used to it I had a
real<00:01:30.540> problem<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.140> first<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> played<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
real problem the first time I played it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
real problem the first time I played it
but<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> played<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> couple<00:01:32.970> things<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but I played it a couple things and you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
but I played it a couple things and you
soon<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> hang<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.570> have

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
soon get the hang of it but you do have

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.500 
soon get the hang of it but you do have
to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:37.020> fairly<00:01:37.350> precise<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.670> promise

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
to be fairly precise where you promise

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.660 
to be fairly precise where you promise
I<00:01:40.630> really<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> premise<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.280> this<00:01:42.400> game

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
I really like the premise of this game

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.330 
I really like the premise of this game
but<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.240> fact<00:01:43.480> that<00:01:43.600> you're<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.050> bad<00:01:44.290> guy

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
but the fact that you're the bad guy

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.370 
but the fact that you're the bad guy
they're<00:01:45.340> destroying<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.120> city<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.630> eating

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
they're destroying the city of eating

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.170 
they're destroying the city of eating
the<00:01:47.410> people<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.580> know<00:01:48.670> not<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:48.880> you'd

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the people and you know not that you'd

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.460 
the people and you know not that you'd
really<00:01:49.480> want<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.720> do<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.110> real<00:01:50.140> life<00:01:50.290> but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
really want to do that in real life but

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.970 
really want to do that in real life but
it<00:01:50.830> it's<00:01:51.370> a<00:01:51.520> nice<00:01:51.730> change<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.540> place<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.110> play

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
it it's a nice change of place to play

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.730 
it it's a nice change of place to play
as<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.910> villain<00:01:55.300> instead<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.670> hero<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:59.470> course

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
as the villain instead of hero of course

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.310 
as the villain instead of hero of course
no<00:02:00.580> villain<00:02:01.300> really<00:02:01.630> thinks<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.110> themselves

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
no villain really thinks of themselves

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.180 
no villain really thinks of themselves
as<00:02:02.710> being<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.070> villain<00:02:06.090> car<00:02:07.090> elite<00:02:07.420> has<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:08.190> nice

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190
