00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
a kind of a new prototype I would

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.470 
a kind of a new prototype I would
describe<00:05:59.890> that<00:05:59.980> as<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.340> megaphone<00:06:00.610> which<00:06:01.360> is

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
understood can really take hold and

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.150 
understood can really take hold and
change<00:06:31.390> the<00:06:31.600> way<00:06:31.720> people<00:06:31.750> think<00:06:32.140> part<00:06:32.950> of<00:06:33.070> the

with him he's a character that wakes up

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.080 
with him he's a character that wakes up
in<00:06:46.150> the<00:06:46.240> morning<00:06:46.570> and<00:06:46.750> decides<00:06:47.200> what<00:06:48.090> aspect

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
in the morning and decides what aspect

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.450 
in the morning and decides what aspect
of<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.270> world<00:06:49.420> can<00:06:49.630> I<00:06:49.690> change<00:06:50.280> Stephen<00:06:51.280> is<00:06:51.430> a

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
of the world can I change Stephen is a

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.340 
of the world can I change Stephen is a
very<00:06:51.850> optimistic<00:06:52.630> person

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
very optimistic person

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.220 
very optimistic person
but<00:06:53.920> I<00:06:53.950> don't<00:06:54.220> think<00:06:54.540> it's<00:06:55.540> not<00:06:55.750> that<00:06:55.780> he

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
but I don't think it's not that he
