yep that's pretty much it so how I
always<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:38.380> figure<00:01:39.380> out<00:01:39.470> what's<00:01:39.680> going

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
always have to figure out what's going

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.070 
always have to figure out what's going
on<00:01:40.160> that'll<00:01:40.520> not<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.240> don't<00:01:41.480> see<00:01:41.660> any<00:01:41.810> rust

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
on that'll not it I don't see any rust

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.810 
on that'll not it I don't see any rust
in<00:01:42.320> there<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.770> don't<00:01:42.920> see<00:01:43.190> any<00:01:43.430> uh<00:01:45.790> yeah<00:01:46.790> I

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
in there and I don't see any uh yeah I

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.410 
in there and I don't see any uh yeah I
can<00:01:47.090> move<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.390> around<00:01:47.480> and<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:49.420> know

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
can move it around and you know

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.350 
can move it around and you know
everything's<00:01:53.170> moving<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.880> see<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.120> little

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
everything's moving so you see a little

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.740 
everything's moving so you see a little
bit<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.660> rust<00:01:56.840> right<00:01:57.170> there<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.800> crane<00:01:58.750> but

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
bit of rust right there on the crane but

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.690 
bit of rust right there on the crane but
I<00:01:59.780> don't<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.170> that's<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:01.040> know<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.370> gears

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
I don't think that's you know the gears

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.260 
I don't think that's you know the gears
and<00:02:01.910> all<00:02:02.030> or<00:02:03.190> are<00:02:04.190> fine<00:02:07.540> anyway<00:02:10.120> anybody<00:02:11.120> got

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
and all or are fine anyway anybody got

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.810 
and all or are fine anyway anybody got
any<00:02:11.390> tips<00:02:11.690> might<00:02:12.110> want<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.320> give<00:02:12.500> me<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.820> true

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
any tips might want to give me a true

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.470 
any tips might want to give me a true
try<00:02:14.120> them<00:02:14.270> out<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.760> point<00:02:17.030> was<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
try them out but this point was going to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
try them out but this point was going to
be<00:02:17.570> doing<00:02:17.690> some<00:02:17.960> investigating<00:02:18.680> them<00:02:18.860> what

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
be doing some investigating them what

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.660 
be doing some investigating them what
else<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.180> could<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.000> good<00:02:23.210> stuff

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
else it could be all that good stuff

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.270 
else it could be all that good stuff
that's<00:02:25.670> pretty<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.030> it
