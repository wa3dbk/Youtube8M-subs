here's<00:00:01.390> the<00:00:01.629> pipe<00:00:01.839> cut<00:00:02.200> list<00:00:02.530> it<00:00:03.340> adds<00:00:03.610> up<00:00:03.790> to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:03.850 
here's the pipe cut list it adds up to

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.380 
here's the pipe cut list it adds up to
10<00:00:04.359> feet<00:00:04.660> a<00:00:05.939> hacksaw<00:00:06.939> works<00:00:07.209> well<00:00:07.479> for<00:00:07.779> cutting

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.390 
10 feet a hacksaw works well for cutting

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.480 
10 feet a hacksaw works well for cutting
before<00:00:10.390> we<00:00:10.540> can<00:00:10.720> glue<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.140> pipe<00:00:11.380> together<00:00:11.830> we

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
before we can glue the pipe together we

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.760 
before we can glue the pipe together we
have<00:00:12.670> to<00:00:12.850> take<00:00:13.090> care<00:00:13.330> of<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.570> valve<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.380> gets

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
have to take care of the valve that gets

have to take care of the valve that gets
the<00:00:14.980> compressed<00:00:15.490> air<00:00:15.850> into<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.630> launcher<00:00:17.310> so

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.710 
chips with a fingernail to ensure a good
seal<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:41.500> sure<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.950> valve<00:00:42.190> cap<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:42.880> on<00:00:43.059> so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
seal make sure the valve cap is on so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.660 
seal make sure the valve cap is on so
when<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:43.989> grab<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.470> with<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.770> pliers<00:00:45.070> it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
when you grab it with the pliers it

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.620 
when you grab it with the pliers it
won't<00:00:45.970> Mar<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.570> threads

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.479 

the<00:00:52.230> plastic<00:00:52.829> needs<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.340> seat<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.880> this<00:00:54.180> groove

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
the plastic needs to seat in this groove

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
the plastic needs to seat in this groove
so<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.150> pull<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.360> through<00:00:57.750> really

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so you need to pull it through really

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
so you need to pull it through really
hard<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> maybe<00:00:59.309> twist<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> turn<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.900> bit

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
hard and maybe twist and turn it a bit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.640 
hard and maybe twist and turn it a bit
to<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> through<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.510> valve<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.080> now

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to get it through with the valve in now

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.080 
to get it through with the valve in now
you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:05.100> glue<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> it'll<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
you can glue so it'll go like this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
you can glue so it'll go like this
another<00:01:09.090> end<00:01:09.360> cap<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.470> 18<00:01:11.040> inch<00:01:11.369> piece<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the tee to the 30 inch piece takes us up

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.740 
the tee to the 30 inch piece takes us up
to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.899> threaded<00:01:28.380> adaptors<00:01:29.300> these<00:01:30.300> allow<00:01:30.720> us

to the threaded adaptors these allow us

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
to the threaded adaptors these allow us

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to unscrew the launcher for easy

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
to unscrew the launcher for easy
transport<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.289> storage<00:01:34.789> then<00:01:35.789> it's<00:01:35.940> on<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
transport and storage then it's on to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.469 
transport and storage then it's on to
the<00:01:36.360> 48<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.229> 4-foot<00:01:38.220> piece<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.910> there's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the 48 or 4-foot piece and there's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.219 
the 48 or 4-foot piece and there's
nothing<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.350> other<00:01:40.380> end<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.930> sand<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
nothing on the other end I sand the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.859 
nothing on the other end I sand the
surfaces<00:01:43.950> both<00:01:44.310> inside<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:44.940> outside<00:01:45.330> that

surfaces both inside and outside that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.560 
surfaces both inside and outside that
will<00:01:46.350> glue<00:01:46.649> together<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.060> seems<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.539> work

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
will glue together and it seems to work

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
will glue together and it seems to work
but<00:01:49.440> be<00:01:49.649> warned<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.280> you're<00:01:50.399> supposed<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but be warned that you're supposed to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
but be warned that you're supposed to
use<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.210> primer<00:01:51.750> before<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.560> use<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> glue<00:01:53.429> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
use a primer before you use the glue it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
use a primer before you use the glue it
seems<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:54.929> always<00:01:55.289> have<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> use<00:01:55.920> big<00:01:56.250> pliers<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
seems I always have to use big pliers to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.390 
seems I always have to use big pliers to
get<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> pipe<00:01:57.659> cement<00:01:58.170> open<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
get the pipe cement open but then I

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.910 
get the pipe cement open but then I
close<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.450> tight<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.590> doesn't

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
close it really tight too so it doesn't

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.120 
close it really tight too so it doesn't
dry<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.270> put<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> pipe<00:02:03.689> cement<00:02:04.200> both<00:02:04.470> inside

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
dry out put the pipe cement both inside

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.240 
dry out put the pipe cement both inside
and<00:02:05.159> outside<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.650> quickly<00:02:07.650> push<00:02:07.979> them

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and outside and quickly push them

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
and outside and quickly push them
together<00:02:09.170> solvent<00:02:10.170> cement<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.130> nasty

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
together solvent cement is really nasty

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
together solvent cement is really nasty
stuff<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.720> should<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.170> doing<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
stuff and you should be doing this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.600 
stuff and you should be doing this
