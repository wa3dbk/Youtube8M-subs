00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.890
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.390
 here I bring you another video guys and how 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.700
 you have seen in the title this is the 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.490
 chapter number 0 of the underworld because it is 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.380
 Chapter 0 as I told you I would like 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.450
 in this section upload a weekly video 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.980
 in which we make a brief summary of 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.080
 all the constructions that we carry in 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.789
 the underworld and in that same video is 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 where the whole issue of the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.840
 participation as we have not done yet 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.789
 no chapter of the underworld this is going to 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.260
 be chapter number 0 ie the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.110
 home where will all the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.390
 participation of the new section and in 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.269
 this video in this little video we're going to 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.589
 generate the world of the underworld this time 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.080
 it will be flat but many subscribers 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.870
 they have also said that in the following 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.879
 worlds we could make a normal world and 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.339
 in the building I think it's a good idea 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.930
 so as I say we'll see for 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.339
 the next world for now we are going to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.260
 fill a super flat world of 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.699
 constructions I love you too 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.530
 explain in this video how the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.850
 theme of participation and these videos 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.859
 summary 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 as I say to you in the week that comes by 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.150
 example would be as follows and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.920
 let's for example have a live has 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.710
 a live event from the underworld on 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.570
 Sunday and maybe next week 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.009
 on Wednesday I would make a summary of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.860
 what we have done in that chapter that 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.990
 it would be already number one and we will have to 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.759
 leave all the comments there for 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.399
 be able to participate the following week 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.130
 It's worth as I say the whole subject of 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.140
 participation goes here how is the topic of 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.450
 participation now if simply 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 guys in this video you have to leave a 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 commentary 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 with your gamertag and the reason for the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.509
 which you would have to participate in the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.119
 Underworld as I say you can not 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.679
 repeat subscribers in this section as well 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.149
 that we are going to rotate so that you do not 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.190
 worry you just have to have a 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.440
 bit of luck the comments will be 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.909
 chosen that is to say the subscribers 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.049
 Subscriber comments 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.369
 will be chosen at random or for the reason 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.229
 whereby they say they want to participate 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.149
 maybe some of the reasons and I 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.830
 like more than another one will be chosen but 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.230
 equally as I tell you there is no 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.900
 kind of problem because the subscribers 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.160
 they are going to be rotating you can not repeat like this 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.980
 that little by little he will be participating 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.350
 more and more people as you see 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.210
 we already have the world of a created world 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.850
 today what we are going to do is inaugurate it 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.190
 with that block of stone brick like that 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.350
 that we will leave it like this so that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.110
 week in the special live of the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.880
 underworld we start to build here the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.500
 subject of the seven and subscribers that are going 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.110
 to be chosen for this week is 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.300
 will warn on the video where you notified the time 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.700
 and the date of the next livestream e 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
 indicate when and at what time the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.050
 livestream of the underworld and I will also say 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.720
 the 7 subscribers that are going to participate 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.130
 in that first chapter it's worth 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 apart from this I will also tell you 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.090
 that if any of the subscribers 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.550
 chosen not for whatever it is can not 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 participate is disconnected does not affect 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.460
 the invitations and other one of the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.800
 chosen from the chosen subscribers 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.020
 invite some of your friends for 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.580
 defect is to say if we 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.470
 imagine that we chose 7 subscribers and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.810
 you can only participate 5 because some of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.840
 those subscribers invite a friend or 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.700
 failing that if by some chance some 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.770
 subscribers can not invite 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.870
 some friend at that moment I will invite 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.480
 any of the subscribers that you already have 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.420
 in my friends list because I can not 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.340
 invite or add someone to friends 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.230
 to invite him to his world live 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.050
 because many subscribers send 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 instant invitations during the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.950
 Live streaming can not be used, so 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.900
 it will work that way guys 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.209
 just leave a comment on the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.040
 video with the reason why you have 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.770
 to participate because I know how to build 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 skyscraper I follow you since you had 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.740
 less a suv and I've been watching all my life 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.300
 minecraft in your channel you are everything to me 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.400
 and all that kind of stuff you already know 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.990
 guys any kind of motive is worth 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.610
 anything you simply do 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.130
 grace to anything that calls me the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.420
 attention to be able to choose you with those 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 comments that this video will have 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.750
 as I tell you equally not only have 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.340
 that see the reasons but also 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.709
 it will be a little random so that everything 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.870
 rotate so do not forget 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.060
 leave a comment in this video with 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.760
 motive and your gamertag yes guys 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.680

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.570
 I can add it will be deleted directly 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.100
 that participation so it 's very 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.500
 important to say the gamer so well 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.139
