hello<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.630> name<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.840> Helen<00:00:22.170> O'Neill<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
hello my name is Helen O'Neill from the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
hello my name is Helen O'Neill from the
PMC<00:00:23.519> studio<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.570> tutorial<00:00:24.779> I'm

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
PMC studio and in this tutorial I'm

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
PMC studio and in this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.680> covering<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.730> types

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
going to be covering the different types

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.560 
going to be covering the different types
of<00:00:27.180> precious<00:00:27.840> metal<00:00:28.199> clay<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.640> there's<00:00:30.240> three

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
of precious metal clay so there's three

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
of precious metal clay so there's three
different<00:00:30.779> types<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.560> precious<00:00:31.949> metal<00:00:32.250> clay

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
different types of precious metal clay

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
different types of precious metal clay
the<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> was<00:00:34.140> originally

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the first one that was originally

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.209 
the first one that was originally
produced<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:36.059> PMC<00:00:36.719> standard<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.920> came

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
produced was PMC standard and that came

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.270 
produced was PMC standard and that came
out<00:00:38.250> about<00:00:38.670> ten<00:00:39.329> years<00:00:39.570> ago<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.829> shrinks

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
out about ten years ago now this shrinks

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000 
out about ten years ago now this shrinks
about<00:00:41.399> 30%<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.809> needs<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.320> fired<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
about 30% but needs to be fired in a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
about 30% but needs to be fired in a
kiln<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.820> hours<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:46.079> unless<00:00:46.350> you're

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
kiln for two hours now unless you're

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
kiln for two hours now unless you're
going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.100> something<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
going to make something that's going to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
going to make something that's going to
shrink<00:00:48.440> there<00:00:49.440> isn't<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:49.739> much<00:00:49.950> point<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
shrink there isn't really much point in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
shrink there isn't really much point in
using<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.300> suitable<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:52.020> making

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
using it so it's not suitable for making

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
using it so it's not suitable for making
rings<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:53.039> combining<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.850> glass<00:00:54.210> and

ceramics<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.129> next<00:00:56.430> type<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> precious<00:00:57.449> metal

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
ceramics the next type of precious metal

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
type that could be torch fired it is a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.649 
type that could be torch fired it is a
little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.510> dry<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.880> some<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.180> still<00:01:09.390> use

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
little bit dry and some people still use

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.140 
little bit dry and some people still use
it<00:01:09.869> today<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.250> torch<00:01:11.549> fired<00:01:11.880> and

it today and it can be torch fired and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750 
it today and it can be torch fired and
killed<00:01:12.210> fired<00:01:12.920> however<00:01:13.920> since<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.400> things

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
killed fired however since then things

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
killed fired however since then things
have<00:01:14.909> moved<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.340> third

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
have moved on and we now have the third

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
have moved on and we now have the third
generation<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.420> precious<00:01:18.810> metal<00:01:19.170> clay<00:01:19.380> which

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
generation of precious metal clay which

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.780 
generation of precious metal clay which
is<00:01:20.220> PMC<00:01:21.090> three<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:22.350> PMC's<00:01:22.950> three<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is PMC three now PMC's three is the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
is PMC three now PMC's three is the
strongest<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:25.200> three<00:01:25.530> different

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
strongest out of all three different

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
strongest out of all three different
types<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> smallest<00:01:27.630> particle

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
types as it has the smallest particle

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
types as it has the smallest particle
size<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.130> therefore<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> lowest

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
size and therefore it has the lowest

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
size and therefore it has the lowest
rate<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.290> shrinkage<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:32.670> means<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
rate of shrinkage this means that it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
rate of shrinkage this means that it's
very<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.810> mixed-media<00:01:34.680> projects<00:01:35.520> if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
very good for mixed-media projects if

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
very good for mixed-media projects if
you<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> combine<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> glass

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you want to combine it with the glass

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
you want to combine it with the glass
ceramics<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.060> different<00:01:39.540> types<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
ceramics or other different types of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.130 
ceramics or other different types of
metal<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.820> comes<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.240> different<00:01:42.360> forms<00:01:42.840> as

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
metal now it comes in different forms as

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.069 
metal now it comes in different forms as
well<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> lump<00:01:44.490> clay<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.420> also

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
well not just in the lump clay it also

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.590 
well not just in the lump clay it also
comes<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.979> syringe<00:01:47.399> which<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.360> one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
comes in a syringe which is this one

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.260 
comes in a syringe which is this one
which<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> pre-loaded<00:01:49.500> syringe<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.430> once

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
which is a pre-loaded syringe and once

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
which is a pre-loaded syringe and once
you<00:01:51.450> open<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> pack<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.560> push<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you open the pack you just push on the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
you open the pack you just push on the
nozzle<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.570> ready<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.649> there's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
nozzle and it's ready to go and there's

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.459 
nozzle and it's ready to go and there's
no<00:01:56.369> need<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.290> can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
no need to use this all in one go it can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
no need to use this all in one go it can
simply<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.890> kept<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.579> cup<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.119> water<00:02:00.360> until

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
simply be kept in a cup of water until

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
simply be kept in a cup of water until
the<00:02:01.380> next<00:02:01.560> time

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the next time

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.580 
the next time
another<00:02:03.719> type<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.469> PMC<00:02:05.310> 3<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.570> paste<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
another type of PMC 3 is the paste so

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.639 
another type of PMC 3 is the paste so
this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> paste<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> basically<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
this is the paste which is basically a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.780 
this is the paste which is basically a
slip

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
slip

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
slip
it's<00:02:12.120> fine<00:02:12.450> silver<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.110> has<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> little<00:02:13.739> bit

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's fine silver which has a little bit

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.220 
it's fine silver which has a little bit
more<00:02:14.069> water<00:02:14.310> added<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.989> very

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
more water added to it so this is very

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.740 
more water added to it so this is very
good<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.950> painting<00:02:17.370> onto<00:02:17.519> organic<00:02:18.180> materials

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
good for painting onto organic materials

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.860 
good for painting onto organic materials
or<00:02:19.170> using<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.069> join<00:02:20.310> pieces<00:02:20.909> together<00:02:21.150> if

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
or using it to join pieces together if

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.569 
or using it to join pieces together if
you're<00:02:22.500> using<00:02:22.709> pace<00:02:23.099> it's<00:02:23.370> always

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
you're using pace it's always

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.729 
you're using pace it's always
recommended<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.720> two<00:02:25.110> pots<00:02:25.470> so

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
recommended that you have two pots so

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.890 
recommended that you have two pots so
you've<00:02:25.860> got<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.549> is<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.819> nice<00:02:27.420> clean

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you've got one which is your nice clean

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.559 
you've got one which is your nice clean
fresh<00:02:28.230> paste<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.159> then<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.730> keep<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.180> separate

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
fresh paste and then you keep a separate

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.770 
fresh paste and then you keep a separate
pot<00:02:30.840> which<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> recycling<00:02:32.220> pot<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.879> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
pot which is a recycling pot and the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.880 
pot which is a recycling pot and the
recycling<00:02:34.409> is<00:02:34.560> really<00:02:35.150> dried<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:36.230> PMC<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
recycling is really dried out PMC that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
recycling is really dried out PMC that
you<00:02:38.220> know<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> piece<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.940> you've<00:02:39.060> made<00:02:39.359> you've

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
you know a piece that you've made you've

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.539 
you know a piece that you've made you've
decided<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.319> don't<00:02:40.470> longer<00:02:40.859> like<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
decided you don't longer like it and

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.099 
decided you don't longer like it and
then<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.870> put<00:02:43.079> it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
then what you can do is you can put it

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.589 
then what you can do is you can put it
into<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.439> pot<00:02:43.739> with<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:44.190> tap<00:02:44.459> water<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.090> just

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
into a pot with some tap water and just

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.360 
into a pot with some tap water and just
leave<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.109> dissolve<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.769> give<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.099> stir

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
leave it to dissolve just give it a stir

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.890 
leave it to dissolve just give it a stir
now<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.819> again<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.239> will<00:02:48.690> dissolve

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
now and again and that will dissolve

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.949 
now and again and that will dissolve
into<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.859> pace<00:02:50.159> that's<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.549> recycling<00:02:51.299> one<00:02:51.510> so

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
into a pace that's a recycling one so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.110 
into a pace that's a recycling one so
again<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.889> can<00:02:53.040> use<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.730> joining

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
again that's one you can use for joining

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800 
again that's one you can use for joining
pieces<00:02:54.569> together<00:02:55.459> now<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.519> fourth<00:02:56.970> type<00:02:57.359> well

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
pieces together now the fourth type well

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.059 
pieces together now the fourth type well
not<00:02:57.989> really<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:59.099> silver<00:02:59.670> is<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.359> gold<00:03:01.069> and

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
not really of silver is the gold and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.180 
not really of silver is the gold and
this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.700> 22<00:03:03.209> karat<00:03:03.930> gold<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.889> comes

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this is a 22 karat gold and it comes

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.020 
this is a 22 karat gold and it comes
only<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.180> lump<00:03:06.480> clay<00:03:06.900> form<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.730> what<00:03:08.879> you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
only in a lump clay form but what you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.970 
only in a lump clay form but what you
can<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.389> is<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.659> can<00:03:09.810> add<00:03:09.959> some<00:03:10.319> water<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.859> this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
can do is you can add some water to this

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580 
can do is you can add some water to this
and<00:03:11.040> turn<00:03:11.639> this<00:03:11.790> into<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.269> paste<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.379> can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
and turn this into a paste that you can

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.129 
and turn this into a paste that you can
then<00:03:13.799> add<00:03:14.099> on<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.849> silver<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.659> becomes

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
then add on to the silver so it becomes

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.069 
then add on to the silver so it becomes
like<00:03:16.379> a<00:03:17.030> coating<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.419> put<00:03:18.599> onto<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
like a coating that you can put onto the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.479 
like a coating that you can put onto the
silver<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.730> those<00:03:20.910> are<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> different<00:03:21.569> types

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
silver so those are the different types

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.970 
silver so those are the different types
finally<00:03:23.569> briefly<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.720> go<00:03:24.810> back<00:03:25.079> onto<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> PMC

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
finally briefly to go back onto the PMC

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180 
finally briefly to go back onto the PMC
plus<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.090> sheet<00:03:27.709> now<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.769> sheet

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
plus there is this sheet now the sheet

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.439 
plus there is this sheet now the sheet
is<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.459> very<00:03:29.879> very<00:03:30.269> thin<00:03:30.720> type<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.829> clay<00:03:32.549> but<00:03:32.849> it

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
is a very very thin type of clay but it

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.780 
is a very very thin type of clay but it
has<00:03:33.660> no<00:03:33.989> water<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:34.919> it<00:03:35.160> doesn't<00:03:35.459> need<00:03:35.639> to

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
has no water in it so it doesn't need to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.210 
has no water in it so it doesn't need to
dry<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.329> can<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:36.989> fired<00:03:37.290> straight<00:03:37.769> into<00:03:38.099> the

plus<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.180> very<00:03:42.690> much<00:03:42.900> acts<00:03:43.349> as<00:03:43.769> PM<00:03:44.400> c3<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
plus it very much acts as PM c3 so you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.990 
plus it very much acts as PM c3 so you
