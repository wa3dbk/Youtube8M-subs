air<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.190> camshaft<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> heart<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
air for camshaft is really the heart of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
air for camshaft is really the heart of
this<00:01:00.750> engine<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.859> computer

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this engine it was the first computer

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.299 
this engine it was the first computer
designed<00:01:02.850> cam<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> manufacturer<00:01:05.189> in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
designed cam out of a manufacturer in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.850 
designed cam out of a manufacturer in
the<00:01:05.430> 60s<00:01:05.939> Pontiac<00:01:06.840> had<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.680> good

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the 60s Pontiac had a lot of really good

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
the 60s Pontiac had a lot of really good
engine

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
engine

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
engine
and<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:10.620> was<00:01:10.800> really<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.390> pinnacle<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and this was really the pinnacle of that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
and this was really the pinnacle of that
this<00:01:13.080> ran<00:01:13.320> Airport

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this ran Airport

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.540 
this ran Airport
so<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.940> only<00:01:15.060> 12<00:01:15.890> ram<00:01:16.890> air<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.310> four

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
so if there was only 12 ram air for four

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.840 
so if there was only 12 ram air for four
speed<00:01:17.820> convertibles<00:01:18.420> made<00:01:19.010> what<00:01:20.010> was<00:01:20.160> 69<00:01:20.580> ram

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
speed convertibles made what was 69 ram

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.000 
speed convertibles made what was 69 ram
air<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.450> production<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.230> because<00:01:22.890> they

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
air for production like because they

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.530 
air for production like because they
spanned<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> across<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> GTO<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
spanned it across the GTO in the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.160 
spanned it across the GTO in the
Firebird

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Firebird

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
Firebird
yeah<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.980> Firebird<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.110> lot

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
yeah the Firebird they didn't get a lot

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.140 
yeah the Firebird they didn't get a lot
of<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> advertising<00:01:29.130> budget<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> GTO

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of the advertising budget like the GTO

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.180 
of the advertising budget like the GTO
bids<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.900> their<00:01:31.170> numbers<00:01:31.470> were<00:01:31.650> quite<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> lot

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
bids so their numbers were quite a lot

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.770 
bids so their numbers were quite a lot
lower<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:32.970> don't<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> exact

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
lower you know I don't have the exact

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
lower you know I don't have the exact
numbers<00:01:34.140> roughly<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> hundred<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> fifty<00:01:35.640> five

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
numbers roughly a hundred and fifty five

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
numbers roughly a hundred and fifty five
hundred<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.410> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
hundred and something like that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.110 
hundred and something like that
sure<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.160> less<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.460> couple<00:01:38.670> hundred<00:01:38.790> yeah

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
sure but less than a couple hundred yeah

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.910 
sure but less than a couple hundred yeah
less<00:01:39.300> than<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.510> couple<00:01:39.720> hundred<00:01:39.810> fifty<00:01:40.530> five<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
less than a couple hundred fifty five of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.940 
less than a couple hundred fifty five of
those<00:01:41.010> were<00:01:41.070> transient<00:01:41.910> part<00:01:42.090> tops<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
those were transient part tops so the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
those were transient part tops so the
rest<00:01:44.160> of<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.400> were<00:01:44.520> Firebird<00:01:45.290> hardtops<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
rest of them were Firebird hardtops and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.060 
rest of them were Firebird hardtops and
convertibles<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.810> interestingly<00:01:48.860> none<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
convertibles here interestingly none of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.640 
convertibles here interestingly none of
the<00:01:50.190> Trans<00:01:50.520> Am<00:01:50.790> convertibles<00:01:51.570> came<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
the Trans Am convertibles came with the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.350 
the Trans Am convertibles came with the
ram<00:01:52.800> air<00:01:52.950> form<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.150> talking

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
ram air form so if you're talking

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.380 
ram air form so if you're talking
Firebird<00:01:55.050> convertible<00:01:55.760> its<00:01:56.760> these<00:01:57.000> twelve

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
Firebird convertible its these twelve

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.040

expected five of these two automatics
yeah<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:31.030> kind<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> opposite<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.900> what

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
does somebody find it one of twelve and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
does somebody find it one of twelve and
how<00:02:37.390> many<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.600> these<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:37.900> are<00:02:38.080> left

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
how many of these do you think are left

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400 
how many of these do you think are left
now<00:02:38.380> there<00:02:39.190> are<00:02:39.310> five<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.850> them<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.900> five<00:02:41.140> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
now there are five of them the five that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.740 
now there are five of them the five that
exist<00:02:41.770> right<00:02:41.860> now<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.459> been<00:02:42.640> known<00:02:42.880> for<00:02:43.360> at
