00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.400
 around 32 million tons of milk 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.360
 produced annually in Germany by 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.929
 about 79,000 dairy farms one 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.519
 peter maurus belongs to the allgÃ¤u 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.309
 april, the farmer is allowed to milk so much 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.000
 sell who wants because then the falls 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 milk quota away for 31 years eu-far 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.400
 the amount has regulated in the Bavarian 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.020
 obergÃ¼nzburg manages maurus one 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.840
 yard with 80 cows 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.930
 each has a name and each one must 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 be milked twice a day whether the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 milk has a good quality depends 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 everything from feed daily 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.129
 maurus a certain mixture of ground 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.420
 and power food ago it is off and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.420
 distribute it at his 4 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.770
 then it is eaten 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.160
 shortly thereafter, he drives the cows together 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.770
 the line is in front of the milking machine 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.920
 long in the usual manner each takes 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.300
 animal his place 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 at the same time, you can always have twelve here 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.260
 Cows are milked 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.820
 with negative pressure the milk is released from the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.870
 udder pulled 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.980
 that's about 30 liters per cow per day 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.980
 everything happens here automatically 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 When a cow is finished knows the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.899
 Machine such a process takes about 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.600
 Ten minutes later every cow has to return 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.009
 back to the barn and give the milk 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.009
 makes you hungry too 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 meanwhile , the milk flows through 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.009
 put a filter in a big tank there 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.440
 it is permanently cooled and stirred 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.480
 and what is now from nearly 50 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.170
 percent of the milk leaves the German 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.630
 Dairies as cheese will be 20 percent 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.630
 processed butter and buttermilk and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.680
 17 percent land as drinking milk in 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.680
