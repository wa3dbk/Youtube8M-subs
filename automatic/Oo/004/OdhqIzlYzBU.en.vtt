right<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.020> then<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.500> these<00:02:14.310> wires

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
right here and then this these wires

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.920 
right here and then this these wires
here<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.720> speakers<00:02:17.420> over<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.810> we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
here go to the speakers over here we

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.140 
here go to the speakers over here we
have<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.230> power<00:02:19.560> supply<00:02:19.980> board<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.820> got<00:02:20.910> one

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
have the power supply board it's got one

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.750 
have the power supply board it's got one
cable<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.780> goes<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.710> main<00:02:23.490> board

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
cable here that goes to the main board

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.970 
cable here that goes to the main board
then<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> has<00:02:24.990> another<00:02:25.290> cable<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> goes

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
then here it has another cable that goes

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.390 
then here it has another cable that goes
to<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.490> panel<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.230> here<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.440> connection<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
to the panel and here a connection that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.250 
to the panel and here a connection that
goes<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.820> where<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> plug<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.570> TV<00:02:30.990> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
goes to where you plug in the TV I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.980 
goes to where you plug in the TV I
believe<00:02:32.070> that's<00:02:32.310> off<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.790> off<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.120> shot<00:02:33.690> here

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
believe that's off the off the shot here

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.990 
believe that's off the off the shot here
but<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.800> connection<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.460> just<00:02:35.640> goes<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
but this connection here just goes to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.550 
but this connection here just goes to
the<00:02:36.090> adapter<00:02:36.540> where<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> plug<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.020> your<00:02:37.290> TV

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the adapter where you plug in your TV

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
the adapter where you plug in your TV
down<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.430> t-con<00:02:41.910> board<00:02:42.210> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
down here we have the t-con board the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.170 
down here we have the t-con board the
t-con<00:02:43.050> board<00:02:43.320> has<00:02:43.530> these<00:02:43.770> two<00:02:44.010> LVDS<00:02:44.670> cables

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
t-con board has these two LVDS cables

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.870 
t-con board has these two LVDS cables
that<00:02:45.390> go<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.870> main<00:02:46.080> board<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.760> we

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
that go to the main board and then we

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.940 
that go to the main board and then we
have<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:48.360> ribbon<00:02:48.870> cables<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.740> go<00:02:49.890> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
have two ribbon cables here that go to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.870 
have two ribbon cables here that go to
the<00:02:50.220> TV<00:02:50.430> panel<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> remove<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.400> t-con

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the TV panel so to remove the t-con

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.810 
the TV panel so to remove the t-con
board<00:02:54.240> we<00:02:54.450> will<00:02:54.660> remove<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.620> LVDS<00:02:56.370> cable

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.839 
we will go ahead and remove the screws
that<00:03:39.079> connect<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.829> t-con<00:03:40.220> board<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
that connect the t-con board to the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:49.750 
that connect the t-con board to the
panel<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.500> we<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.769> removed<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.280> screws<00:03:49.430> from

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
panel so we have removed the screws from

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.470 
panel so we have removed the screws from
the<00:03:49.879> t-con<00:03:50.299> board<00:03:51.819> now<00:03:52.819> we'll<00:03:53.000> go<00:03:53.180> ahead<00:03:53.299> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
the t-con board now we'll go ahead and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.690 
the t-con board now we'll go ahead and
remove<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.470> board<00:03:54.739> from<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.010> panel<00:03:57.640> now<00:03:58.640> you

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
remove the board from the panel now you

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.110 
remove the board from the panel now you
can<00:03:58.970> put<00:03:59.329> your<00:03:59.480> replacement<00:04:00.109> board<00:04:01.120> right

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
can put your replacement board right

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.509 
can put your replacement board right
back<00:04:02.359> where<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.989> remove<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.859> other<00:04:04.010> one<00:04:04.280> and

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
back where you remove the other one and

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.180 
back where you remove the other one and
then<00:04:05.209> you'll<00:04:05.420> simply<00:04:05.629> put<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.349> screws<00:04:06.680> back

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
then you'll simply put the screws back

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.780 
then you'll simply put the screws back
in<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.989> reconnect<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.170> cables<00:04:09.620> back<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
in and reconnect the cables back to the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:23.590 
in and reconnect the cables back to the
t-con<00:04:11.150> board<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:22.340> pinch<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:23.000> side<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.479> the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
t-con board can pinch the side of the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.159 
t-con board can pinch the side of the
LVDS<00:04:24.229> cable<00:04:24.740> wiggle<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:26.090> get<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.050> in

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
LVDS cable wiggle it in and get it in

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.490 
LVDS cable wiggle it in and get it in
there<00:04:27.289> securely<00:04:28.270> then<00:04:29.270> do<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.630> same<00:04:29.900> with

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
there securely then do the same with

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:40.090 
there securely then do the same with
this<00:04:30.919> lvds<00:04:31.700> cable

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:48.820 

then<00:04:41.100> here<00:04:41.610> put<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.570> ribbon<00:04:42.930> connection<00:04:43.560> in

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.840 

make<00:04:49.830> sure<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.070> have<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.490> there<00:04:50.640> all<00:04:50.820> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
make sure you have it in there all the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:03.720 
make sure you have it in there all the
way<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.420> then<00:04:51.750> flip<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.290> tab<00:04:52.530> down

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.490 

so<00:05:04.240> there<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.420> have<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.660> we<00:05:04.900> have<00:05:04.930> replaced

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
so there you have it we have replaced
