 very good I'm unique and in this video we 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.360
 let's focus on how to do a reset 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.490
 to samsung galaxy s we will make it 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.160
 through two methods if we can 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.290
 access the menu and if we can not remember 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.230
 that this method erases all the data 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.880
 of the device first we're going to 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.860
 check to see what version has the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 device within settings 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.790
 down completely about the phone and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.630
 we see that it has version 2.3.4 we left 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.190
 back until you reach adjustments 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.690
 Privacy 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 restore factory data we can 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 check or uncheck the box 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.570
 format usb storage that would be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.190
 the memory card and then 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.159
 reestablish phone and erase everything a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.469
 Once it is restarted, the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.469
 device with factory settings 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 for the second method with the keys 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 We can remove and put the battery to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 turn it off and once it's turned off 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 we have to press the keys at the same time 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 of raising the volume of power and that of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.210
 menu that is below the screen in 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.160
 the medium until samsung appears and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.310
 we go down with the key to lower the volume 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.280
 where do you put wave the factory reset 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 and confirm with the start button that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.659
 will be under the screen in the middle 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 then we went down stampone yes and confirmed 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 with the same keys and lastly in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.180
 reboot system now we confirm with the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.399
 middle button and we wait for it to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.940
 turn on and when it turns on already 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.070
 we would have ready the hard reset we hope
