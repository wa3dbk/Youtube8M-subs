00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.289
 hello friends we are here in main 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 trade and let's talk about this 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:21.380
 new element that has appeared since the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.380
 1.5 which is called bio light sensor 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 the signal event of 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.870
 receives sun that is solar energy when 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 be day this will give energy 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 how much higher is the sun more 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.590
 energy will give 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.579
 we are going to put it to the night you will see 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.780
 how this goes almost to the top 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.780
 here we are 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.399
 and as you see 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 is putting the national soil of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110
 rest in came very far and now only 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.070
 reaches 0 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.070
 when it's night 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.630
 will not give a signal 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.759
 well then 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.759
 using the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 this new element of arrest 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 it's over here 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.180
 and good, our truth 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.180
 an indicator of what's working 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.040
 Y 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.870
 and we place 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.400
 after 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.400
 Rest 5 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.259
 and a block of commands and a door 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 in what they eat and we put it times &amp; day 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100
 OK 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.420
 when this receives light 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.280
 if it 's here this torch will go off and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.930
 nothing will happen 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 when it is night is then it 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.410
 will understand 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.230
 and send a signal to restore the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.340
 command block 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.340
 and he will be an idiot 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.750
 we are 10 now we put it at night 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.750
 it turns automatically 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.209
 and well, apart from this invention that 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.380
 is very useful because right now I 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.650
 I'm doing 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.850
 or whatever 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.000
 d 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.560
 at daytime 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.740
 before the night comes and gets 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.520
 automatically this 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.520
 participate in the day 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 let's deactivate this turn 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:50.510
 teaches 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.510
 this is basically a roof 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.880
 and automatic 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.700
 It is activated at night 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.700
 consists of putting a 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.530
 a daylight sensor under a piston 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.890
 sticky and connected to a block of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.890
 rest 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.510
 9 of rest 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.510
 but this block and the energy 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.750
 the night 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.540
 and if you have the notes 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.549
 and automatically when the day is done 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.549
 The lights go out at night 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.920
 lights are turned on 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.000
 well, apart 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.000
 we can also thank you 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.470
 new lampposts 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.470
 a lot of wire 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 top of everything we put 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.330
 in the light sensor 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.380
 under 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.380
 a sticky piston 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.629
 below the seen in sticky we have 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.629
 to put a block of registration 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.520
 and to the sides of this invention we put 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.520
 lamp late this 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.389
 and it is already 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.389
 ah 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.750
 a kind of 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.750
 lamps Street lamps that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.750
 automatic 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.409
 to see if he understands the streetlight 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.360
 has a flaw that the truth is that it is 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.569
 as it stays offline but 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.569
 good 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.230
 The same is not a nice design but 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.309
 the store 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.729
 and good until here 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.020
 and the daylight sensor 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.020
 that is, he taught me how to make a 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.430
 automatic lights 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.640
 that tend to get night 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.529
 a mechanism that me and that does not allow 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.659
 never be done at night 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.059
 you have to reactivate it from time to time if 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.129
 you load it to reactivate it by removing and 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.899
 coming back with the soft 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.830
 and some lampposts that really are not 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:28.830
 for nothing from inside 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.780
 I have seen by internet printing 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.370
 and well we hope you liked to give 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.370
 like favorites and subscribe 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.550
