friction<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> got<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.620> bays<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> we

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
friction and you got two bays with it we

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
friction and you got two bays with it we
pretty<00:00:47.610> much<00:00:47.730> attached<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> beyblades<00:00:48.690> into

like interchange the new put whatever

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
like interchange the new put whatever
beyblade<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.680> yeah<00:00:56.309> um<00:00:56.460> but
