00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
this is at flash tip part 2 where we're

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.369 
this is at flash tip part 2 where we're
talking<00:00:05.700> about<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.120> affects<00:00:06.540> aperture<00:00:07.200> has

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
talking about what affects aperture has

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.060 
talking about what affects aperture has
on<00:00:07.680> flash

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.440 

now<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.160> first<00:00:12.400> thing<00:00:12.519> to<00:00:12.580> know<00:00:12.820> is<00:00:13.030> that<00:00:13.090> if

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
now the first thing to know is that if

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.560 
now the first thing to know is that if
you<00:00:13.629> put<00:00:13.839> any<00:00:14.110> form<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:15.099> diffuser<00:00:15.670> onto<00:00:16.420> your

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
you put any form of diffuser onto your

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.240 
you put any form of diffuser onto your
flash<00:00:16.810> like<00:00:17.289> here<00:00:17.560> I'm<00:00:17.680> using<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:18.130> little

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
flash like here I'm using a little

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.620 
flash like here I'm using a little
beauty<00:00:18.730> dish<00:00:18.910> but<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.509> also<00:00:19.720> have<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:21.630> dome

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
beauty dish but I also have the dome

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.740 
beauty dish but I also have the dome
diffuser<00:00:23.050> as<00:00:23.259> well<00:00:23.890> or<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:24.939> only<00:00:25.390> bones<00:00:25.599> at

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
diffuser as well or the only bones at

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.720 
diffuser as well or the only bones at
the<00:00:25.779> future<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:26.289> that<00:00:26.829> will<00:00:26.980> also<00:00:27.310> take<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.519> lot

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
the future and that will also take a lot

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.609 
the future and that will also take a lot
of<00:00:27.789> power<00:00:28.300> into<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.779> flash<00:00:29.019> well<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.410> wouldn't

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
of power into the flash well I wouldn't

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.870 
of power into the flash well I wouldn't
take<00:00:29.679> any<00:00:29.920> part<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.250> flash<00:00:30.400> but<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.699> mean

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
take any part of the flash but I mean

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.519 
take any part of the flash but I mean
less<00:00:31.509> brightness<00:00:31.960> will<00:00:32.110> be<00:00:32.199> able<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.379> come

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
less brightness will be able to come

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.439 
less brightness will be able to come
through<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.949> sucks<00:00:33.250> up<00:00:33.370> about<00:00:33.640> maybe<00:00:33.850> half<00:00:34.210> a

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
through it sucks up about maybe half a

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.600 
through it sucks up about maybe half a
stop<00:00:34.809> of<00:00:34.989> brightness<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.559> then<00:00:35.920> adding<00:00:36.370> this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
stop of brightness and then adding this

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.850 
stop of brightness and then adding this
on<00:00:36.790> as<00:00:36.940> well<00:00:37.150> that's<00:00:37.870> going<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.260> take<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> bit<00:00:38.830> of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
on as well that's going to take a bit of

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.710 
on as well that's going to take a bit of
brightness<00:00:39.400> out<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.120> flash<00:00:40.360> as<00:00:40.660> well

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
brightness out of the flash as well

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.119 
brightness out of the flash as well
because<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:41.320> having<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.559> bounce<00:00:41.769> around<00:00:41.890> a

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
because it's having to bounce around a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.250 
because it's having to bounce around a
bit<00:00:42.250> more<00:00:42.400> things<00:00:42.699> so<00:00:43.299> usually<00:00:43.839> if<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.080> put

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
bit more things so usually if you put

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.350 
bit more things so usually if you put
any<00:00:44.409> stuff<00:00:44.860> on<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.339> front<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.640> your<00:00:45.760> flash<00:00:46.030> you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
any stuff on the front of your flash you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.520 
any stuff on the front of your flash you
usually<00:00:46.479> need<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.839> make<00:00:47.019> it<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.199> bit<00:00:47.350> more

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
usually need to make it a bit more

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.590 
usually need to make it a bit more
powerful<00:00:48.070> same<00:00:48.460> if<00:00:48.640> you<00:00:48.760> putting<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.330> into<00:00:49.449> an

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
powerful same if you putting it into an

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.410 
powerful same if you putting it into an
umbrella<00:00:49.900> or<00:00:50.170> into<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> softbox<00:00:51.580> softbox<00:00:52.299> will

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
umbrella or into a softbox softbox will

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.939 
umbrella or into a softbox softbox will
definitely<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.809> taking<00:00:53.170> some<00:00:53.409> brightness<00:00:53.799> out

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
definitely be taking some brightness out

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.090 
definitely be taking some brightness out
of<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.360> in<00:00:55.479> this<00:00:55.540> case<00:00:55.780> at<00:00:56.049> what<00:00:56.979> we're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
of it but in this case at what we're

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460 
of it but in this case at what we're
doing<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.519> really<00:00:57.879> enough<00:00:58.269> in<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.839> manual

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
doing is really enough in a manual

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.500 
doing is really enough in a manual
setting<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.010> I've<00:01:00.100> got<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:01.000> it's<00:01:01.299> always

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
setting so I've got it so it's always

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.000 
setting so I've got it so it's always
going<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.900> be<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:01.989> certain<00:01:02.470> amount<00:01:02.890> of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
going to be a certain amount of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.760 
going to be a certain amount of
brightness<00:01:03.339> so<00:01:03.489> 1/4<00:01:04.030> power<00:01:04.479> or<00:01:04.750> 1/2<00:01:05.260> power<00:01:05.590> or

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
brightness so 1/4 power or 1/2 power or

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.030 
brightness so 1/4 power or 1/2 power or
a<00:01:05.799> fill<00:01:06.100> power<00:01:06.280> if<00:01:06.850> you're<00:01:07.210> using<00:01:07.360> TTL

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a fill power if you're using TTL

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.679 
a fill power if you're using TTL
settings<00:01:09.040> on<00:01:09.220> your<00:01:09.250> camera<00:01:09.580> well<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.450> does

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
settings on your camera well that does

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.830 
settings on your camera well that does
is<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.200> flash<00:01:11.790> hits<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.330> then<00:01:13.600> it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
is the flash hits you and then it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.140 
is the flash hits you and then it
reflects<00:01:14.290> into<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.680> camera<00:01:14.950> into<00:01:15.430> what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
reflects into the camera into what

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.330 
reflects into the camera into what
shooting<00:01:16.510> just<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> camera

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
shooting just now and then the camera

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.550 
shooting just now and then the camera
goes<00:01:18.370> okay<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.180> need<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.420> brighter<00:01:19.720> or<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.110> need<00:01:20.500> a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
lower and it will drop the it'll tell

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.149 
lower and it will drop the it'll tell
the<00:01:23.590> flashes<00:01:23.980> to<00:01:24.190> change<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:26.980> not

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
the flashes to change but that's not

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.830 
the flashes to change but that's not

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.190 
is a quick video to show you how
aperture<00:01:31.120> effects<00:01:31.510> it's<00:01:31.659> like<00:01:31.780> okay<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.080> what

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
aperture effects it's like okay so what

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.530 
aperture effects it's like okay so what
I<00:01:32.409> shall<00:01:32.710> do<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:32.950> on<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.520> back<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.850> my<00:01:33.940> camera<00:01:34.360> I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.420 
have it so it's fairly underexposed it's
a<00:01:42.430> 19th<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.060> second<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:44.110> at<00:01:44.260> a<00:01:44.430> 4.8

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
a 19th of a second and it's at a 4.8

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.399 
a 19th of a second and it's at a 4.8
I've<00:01:46.330> also<00:01:46.479> got<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.840> serves<00:01:47.050> on<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.200> white

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
I've also got it serves on a white

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.370 
I've also got it serves on a white
balance<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.890> flash<00:01:48.640> as<00:01:49.030> well<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:49.750> at<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
balance of flash as well just so at the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.170 
balance of flash as well just so at the
moment<00:01:50.650> these<00:01:50.770> flash<00:01:51.100> or<00:01:51.460> these<00:01:51.670> lights<00:01:51.970> in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
moment these flash or these lights in

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.360 
moment these flash or these lights in
here<00:01:52.450> are<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:52.930> orange<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.710> all<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.010> flash

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
here are very orange in all the flash

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.100 
here are very orange in all the flash
that<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.909> get<00:01:55.060> with<00:01:55.270> your<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.750> nickel<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
that you get with your and nickel and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.510 
that you get with your and nickel and
speed<00:01:56.260> lights<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.070> normal

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
speed lights that is a normal

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.539 
speed lights that is a normal
temperature<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:58.000> around<00:01:58.150> about<00:01:58.530> 5000<00:01:59.530> K<00:01:59.740> which

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
temperature of around about 5000 K which

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.820 
temperature of around about 5000 K which
is<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.760> same<00:02:00.970> as<00:02:01.120> daylight<00:02:01.630> sunshine<00:02:02.140> but

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
is the same as daylight sunshine but

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.190 
is the same as daylight sunshine but
here<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.490> very<00:02:03.700> orange<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.780> they<00:02:05.020> will

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
here this is very orange so they will

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.950 
here this is very orange so they will
look<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.620> bit<00:02:05.680> strange<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.729> what<00:02:07.270> what<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.750> do<00:02:07.869> is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
look a bit strange so what what to do is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.660 
look a bit strange so what what to do is
we<00:02:08.080> want<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.830> flash<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:09.310> that's<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
we want to have the flash so that's the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.130 
we want to have the flash so that's the
main<00:02:09.879> power<00:02:10.209> or<00:02:10.420> that's<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.720> main<00:02:10.899> light

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
main power or that's the main light

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.869 
main power or that's the main light
source<00:02:11.409> so<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.099> back<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.430> camera<00:02:12.640> you

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
source so in the back of the camera you

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.390 
source so in the back of the camera you
can<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.360> already<00:02:13.540> fairly<00:02:14.400> underexposed

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
can see it's already fairly underexposed

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.780 
can see it's already fairly underexposed
but<00:02:15.700> what<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.060> do<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.690> change<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
but what we can do is we can change the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
but what we can do is we can change the
shutter<00:02:19.060> speed<00:02:19.540> no<00:02:20.290> laughter<00:02:20.499> chin<00:02:21.099> shutter

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
shutter speed no laughter chin shutter

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.210 
shutter speed no laughter chin shutter
speed<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.790> minus<00:02:22.389> or<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.900> 250th<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.769> second

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
speed to minus or to 250th of a second

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
speed to minus or to 250th of a second
and<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.880> will<00:02:25.030> mean<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.660> will<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:26.020> a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
and that will mean that it will be a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.270 
and that will mean that it will be a
very<00:02:26.380> dark<00:02:26.800> picture<00:02:28.740> now<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> only

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
very dark picture now you see the only

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.040 
very dark picture now you see the only
light<00:02:30.580> that's<00:02:30.760> coming<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.240> is<00:02:31.420> actually<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
light that's coming in is actually the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.920 
light that's coming in is actually the
light<00:02:32.260> from<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.370> flash<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.690> light

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
light from that flash but that light

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
light from that flash but that light
over<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.470> that's<00:02:35.560> straight<00:02:36.280> from<00:02:36.310> it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
over there and that's straight from it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.400 
over there and that's straight from it
but<00:02:37.180> that's<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:37.720> gonna<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.900> affecting

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
but that's really not gonna be affecting

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.690 
but that's really not gonna be affecting
the<00:02:38.500> brightness<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.190> barely<00:02:39.400> see

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the brightness that you can barely see

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.110 
the brightness that you can barely see
any<00:02:39.940> rest<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> rim<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.850> now<00:02:42.970> if

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
any rest of the rim there so now if

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300 
any rest of the rim there so now if
we're<00:02:43.270> starting<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.690> use<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> flash<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:45.040> at

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
we're starting to use the flash and at

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.220 
we're starting to use the flash and at
the<00:02:45.370> moment<00:02:45.700> let's<00:02:45.910> check<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.240> settings<00:02:46.630> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the moment let's check the settings so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
the moment let's check the settings so
in<00:02:47.410> commander<00:02:47.920> mode<00:02:48.240> commander<00:02:49.240> mode

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
in commander mode commander mode

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.860 
in commander mode commander mode
I've<00:02:50.410> got<00:02:50.680> group<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.300> manual<00:02:52.300> mode<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.750> at

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
I've got group a manual mode and is at

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.930 
I've got group a manual mode and is at
half<00:02:53.140> power<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.680> that's<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.070> flash<00:02:54.430> over

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
half power so that's that flash over

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300 
half power so that's that flash over
there<00:02:55.150> that's<00:02:56.050> gonna<00:02:56.260> be<00:02:56.350> shooting<00:02:56.710> at<00:02:56.740> half

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
there that's gonna be shooting at half

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.390 
there that's gonna be shooting at half
power<00:02:57.870> stick<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.990> timer<00:02:59.230> setting<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.800> get<00:03:00.250> in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
power stick on timer setting and get in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.090 
power stick on timer setting and get in
position<00:03:01.020> okay<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.320> last<00:03:02.590> one<00:03:02.740> half

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
position okay so this last one half

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:12.839 
position okay so this last one half
power<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.430 

now<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:13.910> change<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.510> what<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.020> can<00:03:15.140> do<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.319> we

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
now to change that what we can do is we

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.949 
now to change that what we can do is we
can<00:03:15.560> lower<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.190> brightness<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.690> flash

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
can lower the brightness of this flash

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.750 
can lower the brightness of this flash
but<00:03:18.830> then<00:03:18.950> we're<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.280> lowering<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
but then we're going to be lowering the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.270 
but then we're going to be lowering the
brightness<00:03:19.849> of<00:03:20.150> everything<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.830> we<00:03:22.010> kind<00:03:22.220> of

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
brightness of everything and we kind of

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.250 
brightness of everything and we kind of
want<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.550> flash<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.000> still<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.420> bright<00:03:24.230> and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
want the flash to still be bright and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.050 
want the flash to still be bright and
keeping<00:03:24.920> everything<00:03:25.129> nice<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.400> duct<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:25.910> what

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
keeping everything nice and duct so what

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.520 
keeping everything nice and duct so what
we<00:03:26.180> need<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.360> do<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:27.080> we<00:03:27.170> need<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.410> change

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
we need to do is we need to change

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
we need to do is we need to change
something<00:03:27.769> else<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:29.060> way<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.239> can

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
something else and the way you can

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.910 
something else and the way you can
change<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.900> brightness<00:03:30.050> of<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.380> flash<00:03:30.590> is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
change the brightness of the flash is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.160 
change the brightness of the flash is
just<00:03:31.519> by<00:03:31.610> changing<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> aperture<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.959> what

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
just by changing the aperture so what

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.839 
just by changing the aperture so what
happens<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> aperture<00:03:34.010> gets<00:03:34.550> bigger<00:03:34.760> or

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
happens is the aperture gets bigger or

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.759 
happens is the aperture gets bigger or
smaller<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.810> bigger<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.440> lot<00:03:36.620> of

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
smaller and if it's bigger it's a lot of

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.960 
smaller and if it's bigger it's a lot of
light<00:03:36.920> in<00:03:37.099> if<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.340> small<00:03:37.519> there's<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> little

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
light in if it's small there's a little

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.380 
light in if it's small there's a little
very<00:03:38.840> little<00:03:38.870> bit<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.380> later

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
very little bit of later

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.650 
very little bit of later
sonate<00:03:41.390> 1.4<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.140> big<00:03:42.379> and<00:03:42.560> an<00:03:43.129> if<00:03:43.370> 22<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.420> tiny

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
sonate 1.4 is big and an if 22 is tiny

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.600 
sonate 1.4 is big and an if 22 is tiny
and<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.170> tiny<00:03:45.349> hole<00:03:45.590> will<00:03:45.950> only<00:03:46.130> let<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.370> little

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
and a tiny hole will only let a little

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.430 
and a tiny hole will only let a little
bit<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:46.970> flash<00:03:47.269> both<00:03:47.630> off<00:03:47.870> me<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.319> go

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
bit of this flash both off me and go

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.949 
bit of this flash both off me and go
back<00:03:48.650> into<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> camera<00:03:49.280> still<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
back into the camera still if in the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.569 
back into the camera still if in the
back<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.290> camera<00:03:51.470> we<00:03:51.650> changed<00:03:52.099> aperture

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
back of the camera we changed aperture

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.009 
back of the camera we changed aperture
so<00:03:52.970> let's<00:03:53.269> make<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.660> two<00:03:54.650> times<00:03:55.010> darker<00:03:56.019> so

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
so let's make this two times darker so

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.300 
so let's make this two times darker so
if<00:03:57.079> we<00:03:57.140> go<00:03:57.260> from<00:03:57.730> four<00:03:58.730> point<00:03:59.030> eight<00:03:59.980> one<00:04:00.980> stop

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
if we go from four point eight one stop

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.809 
if we go from four point eight one stop
is<00:04:01.549> six<00:04:02.060> point<00:04:02.239> seven<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.690> two<00:04:03.680> stops<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:04.310> nine

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
is six point seven and two stops is nine

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.130 
is six point seven and two stops is nine
point<00:04:05.090> five<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.569> means<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:05.989> going<00:04:06.079> to

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
point five so that means it's going to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.940 
point five so that means it's going to
be<00:04:06.200> four<00:04:06.860> times<00:04:07.430> less<00:04:07.970> bright<00:04:08.739> let's<00:04:09.739> take<00:04:09.920> a

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
be four times less bright let's take a

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.490 
be four times less bright let's take a
footer<00:04:10.130> now<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.780> should<00:04:11.989> hopefully<00:04:12.170> not

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
footer now so this should hopefully not

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.770 
footer now so this should hopefully not
be<00:04:12.620> totally<00:04:12.860> blown<00:04:13.250> out<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.610> same<00:04:13.760> movies

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.870 

and<00:04:17.780> as<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.079> can<00:04:18.200> see<00:04:18.380> there's<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.680> lot<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.370> more

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and as you can see there's a lot of more

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.659 
and as you can see there's a lot of more
darkness<00:04:20.389> in<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:21.049> whole<00:04:21.289> picture<00:04:21.650> only<00:04:22.160> thing

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
darkness in the whole picture only thing

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.879 
darkness in the whole picture only thing
that<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.150> lighting<00:04:23.419> me<00:04:23.660> now<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.080> flash<00:04:24.530> and

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
that is lighting me now is the flash and

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.210 
that is lighting me now is the flash and
if<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.280> zoom<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.820> closer<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:27.260> can<00:04:27.380> see<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.680> is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
if we zoom in closer you can see that is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.580 
if we zoom in closer you can see that is
not<00:04:28.580> totally<00:04:29.300> blowing<00:04:29.600> out<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.110> side<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.470> my

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
not totally blowing out the side of my

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.980 
not totally blowing out the side of my
face<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> lot<00:04:32.120> better<00:04:32.389> there

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.760 

so<00:04:39.949> in<00:04:40.039> conclusion<00:04:40.389> aperture<00:04:41.389> in<00:04:41.680> regards<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
so in conclusion aperture in regards the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.490 
so in conclusion aperture in regards the
flesh<00:04:43.030> controls<00:04:44.030> flat<00:04:44.330> very<00:04:44.630> very<00:04:44.900> well<00:04:45.139> if

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
flesh controls flat very very well if

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.379 
flesh controls flat very very well if
you<00:04:45.979> want<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.370> be<00:04:46.460> darker<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.090> make<00:04:47.240> that

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
you want it to be darker you make that

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.320 
you want it to be darker you make that
which<00:04:47.810> are<00:04:47.960> smaller<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.800> make<00:04:48.979> it<00:04:49.130> an<00:04:49.330> f-16

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
which are smaller so you make it an f-16

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.960 
which are smaller so you make it an f-16
instead<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.810> an<00:04:50.900> F<00:04:51.020> 2.8<00:04:51.830> if<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.550> want<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.789> break

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
instead of an F 2.8 if you want to break

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.189 
instead of an F 2.8 if you want to break
through<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:53.389> quickly<00:04:53.570> change<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:53.990> aperture

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
through just quickly change the aperture

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.409 
through just quickly change the aperture
and<00:04:54.530> that's<00:04:55.100> what<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> lot<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.639> people<00:04:56.000> will

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
and that's what a lot of people will

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.360 
and that's what a lot of people will
shoot<00:04:56.660> they<00:04:56.930> will<00:04:57.110> always<00:04:57.470> shoot<00:04:57.680> if<00:04:57.919> they're

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
shoot they will always shoot if they're

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.279 
shoot they will always shoot if they're
doing<00:04:58.520> flash<00:04:58.789> photography<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.570> an<00:04:59.870> aperture

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
doing flash photography in an aperture

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.310 
doing flash photography in an aperture
mode<00:05:00.590> or<00:05:00.830> manual<00:05:01.300> mode<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.449> aperture<00:05:02.960> mode<00:05:03.080> or

the<00:05:03.410> usually<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.680> two<00:05:03.889> ones<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.220> people

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
the usually the two ones that people

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.950 
the usually the two ones that people
will<00:05:04.580> use<00:05:04.610> if<00:05:04.970> they're<00:05:05.479> using<00:05:05.600> flash

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
will use if they're using flash

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.490 
will use if they're using flash
photography

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
photography

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.350 
photography
as<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.250> lot<00:05:07.490> easier<00:05:07.699> and<00:05:07.910> quicker<00:05:08.150> to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
as it's a lot easier and quicker to

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360 
as it's a lot easier and quicker to
quickly<00:05:08.720> change<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> aperture<00:05:09.320> then<00:05:10.009> go<00:05:10.250> into

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
quickly change the aperture then go into

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.950 
quickly change the aperture then go into
the<00:05:10.490> menu<00:05:10.729> settings<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.300> change<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.720> power

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
the menu settings and change the power

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.390 
the menu settings and change the power
of<00:05:12.169> that<00:05:12.349> flash<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:12.979> power<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.250> this

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
of that flash and the power of this

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.159 
of that flash and the power of this
flash<00:05:13.699> and<00:05:13.970> all<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.210> kind<00:05:14.419> of<00:05:14.449> stuff<00:05:14.539> where

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
flash and all that kind of stuff where

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.659 
flash and all that kind of stuff where
you<00:05:15.259> can<00:05:15.380> just<00:05:15.500> quickly<00:05:15.680> go<00:05:15.979> click<00:05:16.340> they<00:05:16.460> click

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
you can just quickly go click they click

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.420 
you can just quickly go click they click
and<00:05:16.880> now<00:05:16.940> that's<00:05:17.599> gonna<00:05:17.720> be<00:05:17.840> half<00:05:17.990> as<00:05:18.139> bright

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
and now that's gonna be half as bright

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.800 
and now that's gonna be half as bright
so<00:05:19.430> that's<00:05:19.910> all<00:05:20.090> tip<00:05:20.240> if<00:05:20.389> you<00:05:20.479> doing<00:05:20.599> flash
