00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
exactly how you perform this but it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.960 
exactly how you perform this but it
seems<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.739> it's<00:02:32.950> only<00:02:33.100> available<00:02:33.250> primarily

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
seems like it's only available primarily

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.300 
seems like it's only available primarily
as<00:02:34.450> your<00:02:34.630> third<00:02:34.840> hit<00:02:35.050> or<00:02:35.260> following<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.980> counter

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
as your third hit or following a counter

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.550 
as your third hit or following a counter
now<00:02:37.060> if<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.270> had<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> speculate<00:02:37.720> I'd<00:02:38.260> say<00:02:38.470> it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
now if I had to speculate I'd say it

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.870 
now if I had to speculate I'd say it
probably<00:02:38.709> either<00:02:38.950> come<00:02:39.250> with<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.580> holding

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
probably either come with of holding

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.070 
probably either come with of holding
down<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> button<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:40.780> your<00:02:40.930> third

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
down the button when you do your third

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.199 
down the button when you do your third
hit<00:02:41.320> or<00:02:41.860> maybe<00:02:42.100> pulling<00:02:42.520> back<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.000> analog

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
hit or maybe pulling back on the analog

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.030 
hit or maybe pulling back on the analog
stick<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.600> then<00:02:44.020> pressing<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.500> final<00:02:44.830> attack

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
stick and then pressing the final attack

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
stick and then pressing the final attack
either<00:02:45.610> way<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.120> aside<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.900> very

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
either way that aside this is a very

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.979 
either way that aside this is a very
welcoming<00:02:47.709> move<00:02:48.390> moving<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.540> from<00:02:49.630> there<00:02:49.840> we

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
welcoming move moving on from there we

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.360 
welcoming move moving on from there we
then<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.260> another<00:02:50.530> look<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> area<00:02:51.190> of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
then get another look at the area of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.740 
then get another look at the area of
stock<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.299> actually<00:02:52.630> something

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
stock and this is actually something

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.060 
stock and this is actually something

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
every single weapon can take advantage

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.340 
every single weapon can take advantage
of<00:03:09.040> aerial<00:03:09.430> striker<00:03:09.820> Bushido<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.540> guild<00:03:10.750> but

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
of aerial striker Bushido and guild but

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.509 
of aerial striker Bushido and guild but
in<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.500> particular<00:03:11.620> case<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.220> once<00:03:12.400> again

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
in this particular case you once again

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.430 
in this particular case you once again
see<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.239> still<00:03:13.299> use<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.780> monster<00:03:14.170> as<00:03:14.320> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
see that you still use the monster as a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.410 
see that you still use the monster as a
springboard<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.160> run<00:03:15.310> towards<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.180> hop

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
springboard you run towards it you hop

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.240 
springboard you run towards it you hop
he<00:03:16.690> then<00:03:16.870> leap<00:03:17.019> off<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.290> monster<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.920> again

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
he then leap off the monster and again

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.620 
he then leap off the monster and again
it<00:03:18.370> allows<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.760> attack<00:03:19.030> from<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.420> much

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
it allows you to attack from a much

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
it allows you to attack from a much
higher<00:03:19.900> plane<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.680> also<00:03:20.799> does<00:03:21.070> appear

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
higher plane and it also does appear

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.220 
higher plane and it also does appear
that<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.880> area<00:03:22.120> attacks<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> Lance<00:03:22.720> you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that in the area attacks the Lance you

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.810 
that in the area attacks the Lance you
can<00:03:23.410> also<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.739> multiple<00:03:24.160> hits<00:03:24.340> which<00:03:24.700> is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
can also do multiple hits which is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.699 
can also do multiple hits which is
pretty<00:03:24.940> handy<00:03:25.329> plus<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.049> can<00:03:26.170> also<00:03:26.260> jump<00:03:26.530> down

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
pretty handy plus you can also jump down

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.259 
pretty handy plus you can also jump down
from<00:03:26.769> an<00:03:26.950> aerial<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.549> straight<00:03:27.790> into<00:03:28.120> a

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
from an aerial and go straight into a

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.580 
from an aerial and go straight into a
charge<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:28.989> lots<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.230> really<00:03:29.350> cool<00:03:29.530> things

on to the hunting skill this is called

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.420 
on to the hunting skill this is called
the<00:03:37.810> shield<00:03:38.140> assault<00:03:38.470> now<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:38.980> basically

the shield assault now this is basically
where<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:40.150> activating<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.840> begin

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
where on activating it you begin

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.390 
where on activating it you begin
charging<00:03:41.350> forward<00:03:41.650> at<00:03:41.799> this<00:03:41.920> time<00:03:41.980> with<00:03:42.280> your

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
a lot of attacks going through and we've

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.890 
a lot of attacks going through and we've
seen<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.060> previous<00:03:46.180> trailer<00:03:46.600> well<00:03:46.870> I

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
seen in a previous trailer well I

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.390 
seen in a previous trailer well I
haven't<00:03:47.140> actually<00:03:47.200> had<00:03:47.410> this<00:03:47.530> confirmed<00:03:47.950> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
haven't actually had this confirmed it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.300 
haven't actually had this confirmed it
looked<00:03:48.730> like<00:03:48.879> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.180> previous<00:03:49.330> commercial

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
looked like in the previous commercial

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.559 
looked like in the previous commercial
that<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.550> can<00:03:50.700> almost<00:03:50.790> part<00:03:51.239> through

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
that this can almost part through

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.059 
that this can almost part through
certain<00:03:51.870> attacks<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.440> might<00:03:52.590> well<00:03:52.709> be<00:03:52.770> a

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
certain attacks so it might well be a

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.350 
certain attacks so it might well be a
really<00:03:53.430> good<00:03:53.550> way<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> kind<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.000> advance

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
really good way to kind of advance

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.120 
really good way to kind of advance
towards<00:03:55.080> an<00:03:55.140> enemy<00:03:55.410> while<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.010> dead

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
towards an enemy while it's dead

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.710 
towards an enemy while it's dead
attacking<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.730> then<00:03:57.000> get<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.270> for<00:03:57.569> some

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
attacking you and then get in for some

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.510 
attacking you and then get in for some
nasty<00:03:58.020> damage<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.890> once<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.160> get<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.400> end

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
nasty damage and once you get to the end

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.550 
nasty damage and once you get to the end
you<00:03:59.670> can<00:03:59.970> follow<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.330> shield<00:04:00.540> assault<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:01.380> a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you can follow the shield assault with a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.530 
you can follow the shield assault with a
thrust<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.340> lance<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.060> not<00:04:03.180> only<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
thrust to be a lance so not only is a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.510 
thrust to be a lance so not only is a
great<00:04:03.900> defensive<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.530> advancing<00:04:05.069> move<00:04:05.250> it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
great defensive and advancing move it

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.160 
great defensive and advancing move it

also provides you with an opening to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.509 
also provides you with an opening to
attack<00:04:07.410> when<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.800> probably<00:04:08.160> wouldn't

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
attack when you probably wouldn't

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.059 
attack when you probably wouldn't
normally<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.849> able<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:10.440> my<00:04:10.769> friends
