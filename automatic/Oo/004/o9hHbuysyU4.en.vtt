easy<00:03:36.510> as<00:03:36.719> opening<00:03:37.370> there<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.549> go<00:03:38.730> he's<00:03:39.299> there

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
easy as opening there we go he's there

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.589 
easy as opening there we go he's there
to<00:03:40.139> get<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:40.949> not<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.669> general

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
to get it but not in that general

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.819 
to get it but not in that general
direction<00:03:42.659> ok<00:03:43.879> this<00:03:44.879> time<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.650> that

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
direction ok this time here I think that

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.009 
direction ok this time here I think that
when<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.430> spotted<00:03:47.699> it<00:03:47.879> presently<00:03:48.510> it's

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
when we spotted it presently it's

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.229 
when we spotted it presently it's
consistent<00:03:49.829> with<00:03:49.979> where<00:03:50.159> this<00:03:50.400> guy's<00:03:50.699> looking

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
consistent with where this guy's looking

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.809 
consistent with where this guy's looking
isn't<00:03:51.689> I<00:03:52.049> mean<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.919> can't<00:03:53.220> obviously<00:03:53.400> be

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
isn't I mean we can't obviously be

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.599 
isn't I mean we can't obviously be
precise<00:03:54.209> about<00:03:54.560> whether<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.370> quite

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
precise about whether it's quite

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.059 
precise about whether it's quite
consistent<00:03:57.209> his<00:03:57.359> head<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.569> know<00:03:57.930> now<00:03:58.769> do<00:03:58.829> you

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.599 
consistent his head I know now do you
think<00:03:59.310> that's<00:04:00.260> could<00:04:01.260> come<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.530> bit<00:04:01.769> nearer<00:04:02.159> to

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
think that's could come a bit nearer to

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.929 
think that's could come a bit nearer to
them<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.150> normal<00:04:03.479> size<00:04:04.009> between<00:04:05.009> it's<00:04:05.370> ed

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
them to normal size between it's ed
