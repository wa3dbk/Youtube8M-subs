00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.540 
it between the levels 10 and 41 I think
which<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.259> quite<00:00:25.499> restricting<00:00:26.069> considering

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
which is quite restricting considering

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.729 
which is quite restricting considering

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
most people online now are in the high

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.130 
most people online now are in the high
50s<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.669> anything<00:00:30.119> above<00:00:30.479> that<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.899> honest

and some people are even in the hundreds
which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.970> ridiculous<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.140> background<00:00:34.470> you

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
which is ridiculous in a background you

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.690 
which is ridiculous in a background you
can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.710> some<00:00:34.830> proof<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.340> am<00:00:35.430> currently

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
basically it's a fenced off area and to

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.260 
basically it's a fenced off area and to
the<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> few<00:00:56.760> heli<00:00:57.000> pads

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
you can see there's no sign of it

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.210 
you can see there's no sign of it

as it does spawn now what you're gonna
do<00:01:10.679> is<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.399> route<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.759> taking<00:01:12.179> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
do is take the route that I'm taking it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.669 
do is take the route that I'm taking it
probably<00:01:12.569> took<00:01:12.659> me<00:01:12.719> about<00:01:12.840> 20<00:01:13.319> minutes<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
probably took me about 20 minutes to

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.230 
probably took me about 20 minutes to
actually<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.219> cargo<00:01:14.429> pop<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.819> spawn<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually get the cargo pop to spawn and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
actually get the cargo pop to spawn and
successfully<00:01:15.749> take<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.340> you're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
successfully take it but what you're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
successfully take it but what you're
gonna<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> second<00:01:18.539> is<00:01:18.990> every<00:01:19.409> time<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
gonna see in a second is every time you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.099 
gonna see in a second is every time you
drive<00:01:19.889> around<00:01:20.219> there<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.179> be<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.359> cargo<00:01:21.929> Bob

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
drive around there will be a cargo Bob

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.870 
drive around there will be a cargo Bob
that<00:01:22.319> spawns<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.979> necessarily<00:01:23.399> every<00:01:23.670> time

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that spawns not necessarily every time

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
that spawns not necessarily every time
but<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.389> quite<00:01:24.719> rare<00:01:25.079> so<00:01:25.109> it<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.560> take<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but it's quite rare so it will take a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
but it's quite rare so it will take a
while<00:01:26.069> as<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.030> after<00:01:27.359> about<00:01:27.810> 20

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
while as you can see after about 20

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.169 
while as you can see after about 20
minutes<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.530> doing<00:01:28.679> so<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.579> does<00:01:29.789> eventually

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
minutes of doing so one does eventually

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.789 
minutes of doing so one does eventually
support<00:01:30.719> and<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:30.959> do<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> try<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.590> shoot

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
support and you do have to try and shoot

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.559 
support and you do have to try and shoot
the<00:01:31.889> pilot<00:01:32.100> very<00:01:32.549> quickly<00:01:32.850> otherwise<00:01:33.240> he<00:01:33.450> will

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
the pilot very quickly otherwise he will

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:34.789 
the pilot very quickly otherwise he will
