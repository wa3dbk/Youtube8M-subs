it<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.670> lot<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.600> came<00:01:07.750> up<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.229> an<00:01:08.560> idea<00:01:08.710> that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
it a lot so I came up with an idea that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.830 
it a lot so I came up with an idea that
emulates<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.880> vibe<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.150> let's<00:01:13.360> see<00:01:13.600> what

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
emulates the vibe and so let's see what

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.700 
emulates the vibe and so let's see what
happens<00:01:14.380> here<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.820> notes<00:01:16.260> if<00:01:17.260> we<00:01:17.500> just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
happens here with the notes if we just

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.649 
happens here with the notes if we just
take<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.010> out<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.430> context<00:01:18.880> real<00:01:19.150> quick<00:01:19.450> and

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
take it out of context real quick and

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.020 
take it out of context real quick and
look<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.170> beginning<00:01:20.680> do<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> dead<00:01:21.850> and

going on slide down a half step do and

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.260 
going on slide down a half step do and
you<00:01:48.729> can<00:01:48.909> do<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.150> like<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.780> trill

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.780 

and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:58.020> comes<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> long<00:01:58.799> descending

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
walking type line we need any dududududu
and<00:02:04.740> notice<00:02:05.100> there's<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> change<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.850> position

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and notice there's a change of position

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.800 
and notice there's a change of position
involved<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.520> gotta<00:02:11.819> get<00:02:12.090> over<00:02:12.360> from

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
particular line it has a combination of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.160 
particular line it has a combination of
a<00:02:38.100> short<00:02:38.819> staccato<00:02:40.910> first<00:02:41.910> section<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.720> then

the long legado second section and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.250 
the long legado second section and
combining<00:02:46.799> those<00:02:47.040> two<00:02:47.340> makes<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.209> musical<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
combining those two makes it musical you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.920 
combining those two makes it musical you
have<00:02:49.440> both<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.190> line<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.090> notice<00:02:51.510> how<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
have both in one line so notice how the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.210 
have both in one line so notice how the
first<00:02:52.230> half<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:53.100> more<00:02:54.060> choppy<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:55.230> schedule

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
first half is more choppy to schedule

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.620 
first half is more choppy to schedule
Scott<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.970> yeah<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.700> after<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.480> go

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
Scott it yeah and then after that you go

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.479 
Scott it yeah and then after that you go
B

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.819 

so<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.760> want<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.060> connect<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.780> notes<00:03:07.109> nicely

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
so you want to connect the notes nicely

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.420 
so you want to connect the notes nicely
to<00:03:08.040> each<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.450> they<00:03:10.170> flow<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:11.400> into

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to each other so that they flow one into

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.090 
to each other so that they flow one into
the<00:03:11.850> other

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.650
