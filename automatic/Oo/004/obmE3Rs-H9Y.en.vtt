this first Swedish stick handing ball is
that<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.680> made<00:02:15.800> out<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.950> wood<00:02:16.069> which<00:02:16.610> means

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that it's made out of wood which means

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.760 
that it's made out of wood which means
that<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> absorbs<00:02:17.720> most<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.350> impact<00:02:18.500> that

that it absorbs most of the impact that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.830 
that it absorbs most of the impact that
you<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.220> your<00:02:19.370> stick<00:02:19.580> blade<00:02:19.819> unlike<00:02:20.660> the

you get from your stick blade unlike the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900 
you get from your stick blade unlike the
in<00:02:20.989> golf<00:02:21.200> balls<00:02:21.440> which<00:02:21.650> ricochet<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.430> bounce

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
in golf balls which ricochet and bounce

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.910 
in golf balls which ricochet and bounce
quite<00:02:23.480> violently<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> fast<00:02:24.290> which<00:02:24.560> make<00:02:24.739> them

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
quite violently and fast which make them

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.320 
quite violently and fast which make them
pretty<00:02:25.310> hard<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.670> control<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.209> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
pretty hard to control you have to have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.970 
pretty hard to control you have to have
very<00:02:26.600> very<00:02:26.840> quick<00:02:27.050> hands<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.440> be<00:02:27.620> able<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:27.830> keep

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
very very quick hands to be able to keep

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.290 
very very quick hands to be able to keep
up<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> UM<00:02:28.550> golf<00:02:28.790> ball<00:02:29.000> instead<00:02:29.150> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
up with the UM golf ball instead of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.520 
up with the UM golf ball instead of
having<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.600> chase<00:02:29.810> after<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.260> whole<00:02:30.350> time

having to chase after it the whole time
you're<00:02:30.650> practicing<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.850> with<00:02:32.000> these<00:02:32.120> as<00:02:32.269> we

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you're practicing so with these as we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.970 
you're practicing so with these as we
said<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> ill<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.050> absorb<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.620> impact

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
said the ill they absorb the impact

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080 
said the ill they absorb the impact
which<00:02:34.190> makes<00:02:34.370> them<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.580> lot<00:02:34.730> better<00:02:34.880> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
which makes them a lot better to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.520 
which makes them a lot better to
practice<00:02:35.239> with<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:36.080> efficient

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
practice with a much more efficient

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.290 
practice with a much more efficient

able to allow your muscles to soak in

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.440 
able to allow your muscles to soak in
the<00:02:40.010> muscle<00:02:40.430> memory<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.880> quick<00:02:41.060> movements

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450

as<00:04:14.120> we<00:04:14.240> said<00:04:14.270> it's<00:04:14.540> made<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.810> wood<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:14.990> it

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
as we said it's made of wood so it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.780 
as we said it's made of wood so it
absorbs<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:16.040> lot<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.280> impact

absorbs a lot of the impact

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.000

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
practice this would definitely be one up

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.370

on<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.700> golf<00:04:22.850> ball<00:04:23.090> as<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.540> it's<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.080> much

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
on the golf ball as it is it's a much

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.540 
on the golf ball as it is it's a much
better<00:04:24.530> training<00:04:24.800> here<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.040> use<00:04:25.160> as<00:04:25.280> we<00:04:25.400> said

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
better training here to use as we said

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.130 
better training here to use as we said
it<00:04:25.640> absorbs<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.090> lot<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> impact<00:04:26.690> which

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
it absorbs a lot of the impact which

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.900 
it absorbs a lot of the impact which
makes<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.590> much<00:04:27.770> more<00:04:28.040> efficient<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.520> use<00:04:28.670> as<00:04:28.880> a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
you know wouldn't water don't mix so you

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.280 
you know wouldn't water don't mix so you
want<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.120> keep<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.390> somewhere<00:04:44.660> nice<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:44.840> dry

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
something like that just remember not to

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.430 
something like that just remember not to
leave<00:04:49.490> them<00:04:49.610> outside<00:04:49.730> but<00:04:50.630> I'm<00:04:50.900> coming<00:04:51.350> back

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
away from that looking at some of the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.890 
away from that looking at some of the
other<00:04:52.820> things<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.180> liked<00:04:53.360> was<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.630> price

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
other things that we liked was the price

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.990 
other things that we liked was the price
as<00:04:54.110> we<00:04:54.200> said<00:04:54.440> Marcin<00:04:55.130> cheap<00:04:55.310> compared<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.850> some

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
as we said Marcin cheap compared to some

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.159 
as we said Marcin cheap compared to some
of<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.090> hockey<00:04:56.240> training<00:04:56.510> aids<00:04:56.780> which<00:04:56.930> tend

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
of the hockey training aids which tend

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.960 
of the hockey training aids which tend
to<00:04:57.200> be<00:04:57.260> very<00:04:57.530> expensive<00:04:57.860> this<00:04:58.640> again<00:04:58.880> is

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
to be very expensive this again is

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.219 
to be very expensive this again is
something<00:04:59.000> very<00:04:59.419> cheap<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.750> pick<00:04:59.870> up<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.110> can

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
something very cheap to pick up you can

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.510 
something very cheap to pick up you can
grab<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.410> couple<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.800> them<00:05:00.950> practice<00:05:01.340> if<00:05:01.460> you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
grab a couple of them practice if you

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.860 
grab a couple of them practice if you
lose<00:05:01.700> one<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.120> not<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.419> much<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.750> big

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
lose one it's not that much of a big

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.850 
lose one it's not that much of a big
deal<00:05:02.900> because<00:05:03.080> they're<00:05:03.350> not<00:05:03.410> too<00:05:03.560> expensive

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
deal because they're not too expensive

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.100 
deal because they're not too expensive
so<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:04.880> we<00:05:04.970> said<00:05:05.150> we<00:05:05.450> like<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.780> because<00:05:05.840> it's

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
so as we said we like it because it's

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.450 
so as we said we like it because it's
light<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.590> can<00:05:06.620> practice<00:05:07.010> your<00:05:07.040> stick

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
light so you can practice your stick

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.670 
light so you can practice your stick
handling<00:05:07.820> being<00:05:08.060> able<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.240> move<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.450> ball<00:05:09.380> or

handling being able to move the ball or

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.650 
handling being able to move the ball or
after<00:05:10.490> practicing<00:05:11.030> with<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.240> moving<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.600> to

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
after practicing with this moving on to

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.820 
after practicing with this moving on to
the<00:05:11.750> park<00:05:11.930> being<00:05:12.169> able<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.350> move<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.650> much

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
the park being able to move that much

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.080 
the park being able to move that much
much<00:05:13.040> quicker<00:05:13.250> on<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.430> ice<00:05:13.580> having<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:13.970> lot

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
much quicker on the ice having a lot

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.270 
much quicker on the ice having a lot
more<00:05:14.240> control<00:05:14.620> practicing<00:05:15.620> different<00:05:16.160> kind

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
more control practicing different kind

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.130 
more control practicing different kind
of<00:05:16.370> skills<00:05:16.610> repetition<00:05:17.360> being<00:05:17.840> able<00:05:17.930> to

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
of skills repetition being able to

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.450 
of skills repetition being able to
repeat<00:05:18.470> dribbling<00:05:18.860> getting<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.190> hang<00:05:19.370> of

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
repeat dribbling getting the hang of

repeat dribbling getting the hang of
dribbling<00:05:19.760> while<00:05:19.910> skating<00:05:20.240> those<00:05:20.840> kind<00:05:21.080> of

dribbling while skating those kind of

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.240 
dribbling while skating those kind of
things<00:05:21.320> really<00:05:21.620> get<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.890> use<00:05:22.010> with<00:05:22.160> these

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
things really get to use with these

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.409 
things really get to use with these
because<00:05:22.430> you<00:05:22.550> can<00:05:22.610> put<00:05:22.850> on<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:22.970> pair<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.210> their

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
because you can put on a pair of their

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.030 
because you can put on a pair of their
inline<00:05:23.690> skates<00:05:23.960> skate<00:05:24.530> around<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.890> car

inline skates skate around in the car

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.530 
inline skates skate around in the car
park<00:05:25.280> wall<00:05:25.460> took<00:05:25.850> get<00:05:26.030> one<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.210> these<00:05:26.300> around

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
park wall took get one of these around

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.430 
park wall took get one of these around
nice<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:26.900> light

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
nice and light

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.500 
nice and light
absorbs<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> impact<00:05:28.580> unlike<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.120> golf<00:05:29.300> pool

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
absorbs the impact unlike the golf pool

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.000 
absorbs the impact unlike the golf pool
so<00:05:29.660> you<00:05:29.750> don't<00:05:29.900> spend<00:05:30.169> your<00:05:30.470> entire<00:05:30.800> training

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
so you don't spend your entire training

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.440 
so you don't spend your entire training
session<00:05:31.400> searching<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:31.970> running<00:05:32.210> off<00:05:32.330> to

these<00:05:32.600> balls<00:05:32.840> which<00:05:33.320> is<00:05:33.470> where<00:05:33.590> another<00:05:33.770> thing

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
these balls which is where another thing

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.740 
these balls which is where another thing
that<00:05:34.040> we<00:05:34.100> like<00:05:34.250> about<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:34.790> also<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.540> price

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
that we like about it and also the price

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.420 
that we like about it and also the price
anything<00:05:36.500> we<00:05:36.650> don't<00:05:36.740> like<00:05:36.919> is<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.160> durability

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
anything we don't like is the durability

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.830 
anything we don't like is the durability
but<00:05:37.820> as<00:05:37.970> we<00:05:38.060> said<00:05:38.210> they're<00:05:38.330> nice<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.600> cheap<00:05:38.750> so

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
