 corsairs and finally the cord 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.379
 power 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.399
 we go now to the cable that you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 will be provided with this power supply 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.969
 fully modular we will have everything 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.840
 first the small usb cables that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.399
 so will connect 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 feeding to your motherboard and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 so of driver and monitor 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.119
 the power supply or under windows then 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.119
 we have a 24-pin cable and tx1 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.299
 cable to 4 8 pin cpu and two cables that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 offers two pci express 6 8 pin plugs 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.729
 we can arrive two big 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 graphics cards 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 we see the finish at these levels 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 cables and type neither nor 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
 guillermo then stick to the cables 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 to devices we will have 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.049
 a strand with 3 taking molex an arm with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 4 arm molex hold with the four 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.729
 taken sata each time and finally two 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.140
 Molex adapters to floppy we see it 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.270
 the finish is flat for these cables there 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 we finish on the block physically 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 speaking it's exactly the same block 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 than the first rm of the name except we have 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 a sticker that is gray-white and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.350
 black so the food is going to get married 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.430
 maybe a little bit more with all 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.079
 the configurations what is not 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 really a bad choice on the part of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.939
 corsair on to the fine welcome below 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.070
 the 135 mm fan which is of type 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.360
 semi passive then we have a part 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710
 superior who is rather working 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.450
 in its forms it's nice we have 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.340
 always the bizots on the sides 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.300
 the sticker we talked about it gray white 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.500
 black we will have them 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.570
 similarly to the stickers on the other side 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.890
 they are in the good sense greenhouse that if 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.140
 you decide to put the food 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.580
 like that with the fan on the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.870
 above and well your self pantyhose and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.790
 in a good way and if you do 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 the reverse of your self adhesive is 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 also in the right direction at the back 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.060
 we find the device for the cord 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.820
 feeding the switch a grid 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.370
 dimpled to extract hot air and 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.070
 finally a small sticker rm 750 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.980
 if we put ourselves in front we have the button 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.110
 to test the fan the diodes the diode 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.940
 for the activity the connectors for the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.160
 corsair link so this is the software that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.140
 allows to monitor and manage 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.910
 the power windows and finally we 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.890
 to all other connectors for 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.010
 different modular cables from 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.540
 the food we finish with the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 technical characteristics and that are 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.490
 indicated below we have 1 3 volts 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.490
 3 of 25 years loses 1.5 volt 2,25 earth 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.160
 1 12 volts 62 years old father and a half the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.890
 same 12-volt rail 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.320
 the price is repeated between 129 and 139 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.430
