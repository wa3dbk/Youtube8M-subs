00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
works you can see it kind of working
there<00:00:23.430> however<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.779> does<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.260> lower<00:00:25.619> base

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there however it does have a lower base

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
there however it does have a lower base
damage<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.880> average<00:00:27.060> mallow<00:00:27.570> on

sniper<00:00:28.140> rifle<00:00:28.590> however<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> make<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.939> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970

sniper rifle however I make up for that
with<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:31.019> huge<00:00:31.769> amount<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.189> critical<00:00:32.460> ascension

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
with a huge amount of critical ascension

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.610 
with a huge amount of critical ascension
spent<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.570> stacking<00:00:34.200> critical

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
spent some time stacking critical

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.030 
spent some time stacking critical
ascension<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> bar<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.270> kill<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> bruiser

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
ascension in the bar to kill a bruiser
now<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> first<00:00:38.489> tried<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> kill<00:00:39.059> Pete<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
now when I first tried to kill Pete it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
now when I first tried to kill Pete it
was<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.200> easier<00:00:40.559> than<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.920> thought<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.250> would

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
was a lot easier than I thought it would

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
was a lot easier than I thought it would
be<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> figured<00:00:42.120> I'd<00:00:42.210> try<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> chain<00:00:42.960> Cal<00:00:43.230> him

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
be so I figured I'd try to chain Cal him

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
be so I figured I'd try to chain Cal him
a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.640> obviously<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.510> I'm

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
a little bit so obviously here I'm

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.209 
a little bit so obviously here I'm
killing<00:00:46.020> myself<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.070> more

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
killing myself so that I can get more

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
killing myself so that I can get more
ammo<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> Pete<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.980> reasonable

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
ammo and so that Pete will be reasonable

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.600 
ammo and so that Pete will be reasonable
so<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.000> gonna<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.300> down<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.840> again

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
so I'm gonna go down here and again

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
so I'm gonna go down here and again
gonna<00:00:53.610> summon<00:00:53.910> him<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.079> time<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> am<00:00:55.559> going

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
gonna summon him so this time I am going

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
gonna summon him so this time I am going
to<00:00:56.129> once<00:00:56.370> again<00:00:56.460> use<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> trespasser<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.109> take

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
to once again use the trespasser to take

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
to once again use the trespasser to take
off<00:00:58.559> his<00:00:58.800> face<00:00:59.010> shield<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> then<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
off his face shield and then use the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
off his face shield and then use the
storm<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.230> kill<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.609> have

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
storm to kill it now I do have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
storm to kill it now I do have
significantly<00:01:03.719> lower<00:01:03.989> critical<00:01:04.470> ascension

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
significantly lower critical ascension

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.730 
significantly lower critical ascension
stacks<00:01:05.129> than<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.519> did<00:01:05.700> last<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.500> will

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
stacks than I did last time so it will

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
stacks than I did last time so it will
be<00:01:07.920> harder<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.909> least<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.420> take

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
be harder or at least it will be take

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
be harder or at least it will be take
longer<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.100> last<00:01:11.369> time

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
longer this time than it did last time

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
longer this time than it did last time
you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.350> still<00:01:13.619> took<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:14.010> his

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you can see that it still took off his

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
you can see that it still took off his
shield<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.509> about<00:01:15.689> 4<00:01:15.990> shots<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
shield in just about 4 shots there

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.310 
shield in just about 4 shots there
that's<00:01:16.799> pretty<00:01:16.950> wild

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
that's pretty wild

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's pretty wild
alright<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.220> getting<00:01:20.610> more

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
this was actually recorded last night

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.949 
this was actually recorded last night
so<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> next<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> be

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
so the next thing I do is going to be

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.070 
so the next thing I do is going to be
checking<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.410> whether<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.610> kunai<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:13.020> the

checking on whether the kunai how the
kunai<00:02:13.440> fixed<00:02:13.800> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
kunai fixed is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.790 
kunai fixed is
working<00:02:14.550> exactly<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.330> want<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.810> test<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
working exactly I do want to test that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.890 
working exactly I do want to test that
out<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:17.280> very<00:02:17.520> curious<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.240> excited<00:02:18.690> about

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
out I'm very curious and excited about

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.840 
out I'm very curious and excited about
that<00:02:19.170> apparently<00:02:19.680> Q<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:20.520> stack

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
that apparently Q and I can now stack

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.510 
that apparently Q and I can now stack
death<00:02:21.120> mark<00:02:21.420> again<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:22.470> great<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.280> all

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
death mark again that's great for all

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.450 
death mark again that's great for all
zeros<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.450> especially<00:02:24.810> melee<00:02:25.500> zero<00:02:25.830> that's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
zeros but especially melee zero that's

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.940 
zeros but especially melee zero that's
something<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.170> really<00:02:28.170> missed<00:02:28.440> about<00:02:28.710> playing

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
something I really missed about playing

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
something I really missed about playing
melee<00:02:29.340> zero<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.970> possibility<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.570> it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
melee zero and the possibility that it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.730 
melee zero and the possibility that it
might<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.200> back<00:02:31.860> now<00:02:32.130> truly<00:02:32.490> excites<00:02:33.030> me<00:02:33.740> so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
might be back now truly excites me so

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.650 
might be back now truly excites me so
since<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.820> lower<00:02:36.030> stacks<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.570> this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
since I do have lower stacks at this

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.770 
since I do have lower stacks at this
time<00:02:36.900> I'm<00:02:37.320> going<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.060> pool<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.540> water

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
time I'm going to have to pool the water

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
time I'm going to have to pool the water
pipe<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> don't<00:02:40.650> expire<00:02:41.460> from<00:02:41.820> damage

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
pipe so that I don't expire from damage

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.770 
pipe so that I don't expire from damage
over<00:02:42.330> time

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
over time

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.830 
over time
luckily<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.770> storms<00:02:44.460> AoE<00:02:45.030> damage<00:02:45.390> will<00:02:45.720> be

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
luckily the storms AoE damage will be

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.420 
luckily the storms AoE damage will be
more<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.200> enough<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> take<00:02:46.650> out<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.160> first

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
more than enough to take out the first

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
more than enough to take out the first
round<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.910> spider<00:02:48.300> ants<00:02:48.660> without<00:02:48.930> me<00:02:49.080> worrying

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
round of spider ants without me worrying

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.890 
round of spider ants without me worrying
too<00:02:49.650> much<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.330> he's<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.690> into

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
too much about them so he's going into

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.080 
too much about them so he's going into
nova<00:02:52.260> mode<00:02:52.470> again<00:02:52.770> I'm<00:02:52.920> gonna<00:02:53.610> get<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:53.970> more
