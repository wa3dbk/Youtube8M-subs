00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello today we will talk to you again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.940
 in fact, we have forgotten about you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.620
 talk about a little feature on 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 the trial lawsuit the chief functionality 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 light so the chief like what 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.630
 it's just a little 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 seeing who will flash who will you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 indicate that it is time to change 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.900
 report 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.830
 so it's very used on track 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 since we do not always have the time to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.230
 look at the account turns and it allows to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 know that you have to pass the speed 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 higher 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 so the pro gie itself does not have any 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.949
 little lights on the other hand what will you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.300
 post it is a little eu that will give way 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.180
 which will just flash 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.890
 quickly in place of the report and who 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 so will you understand but that he 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 it's time to change gears 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.120
 quite simply 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.160
 so this feature only exists 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 on the gie pro x-type so it's the gip 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.890
 rocky and semi plug'n'play all 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 just because it's plugged into 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.969
 the diet thread and so he can know 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 what kind of regime you are in and when 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.699
 change ratio so now what 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.989
 we will show you 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.640
 bah it's just how 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 configure and then we will show you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.649
 on the road what it gives that's all 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.609
 right now 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.409
 the first thing to do is to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.000
 reset this function so 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.549
 how in fact it's very simple we put 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 the contact we start the bike we ride 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 the diet very gradually 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 so the bar normally pops up proves 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 to go to Ã¥ at that time you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 hold the gases for 5 seconds until 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 what a little it is appear when 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 it seems so it means leather that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.439
 means erased is that it's good the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.610
 reset feature so you 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 all you have to do is turn off the gas and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.590
 shut off the engine 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590
 so I'll get you right now 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.350
 So here you start the bike 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.090
 and that's absolutely everything 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.970
 is to raise the gases wait a 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.250
 little bit it seems to cut you off 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.120
 gas and you turn off the functionality has 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.120
 been reset 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.410
 so now that it has been reset 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.400
 we will be able to the probable rpt is so 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.440
 for the scheduled time it's very 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.480
 simple just put the ignition 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.370
 start the bike ride the gas a 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.840
 gradually you go the little one 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.260
 of the shift light function that goes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.090
 appear 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.590
 and in these cases you continue to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.750
 turn on the throttle until you 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.190
 want the u to appear later 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.570
 so for example if you want more 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.920
 late as they appear when you 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.270
 are at 11000 turn you will ride some 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 gas up to eleven thousand turns gently 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.930
 once you're there cut you off 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670
 gas you shut off the engine and got 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 recorded in game makes you a little 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.910
 demo 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.190
 Yes 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.450
 here I am up to 2500 laps 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.830
 when I had the little goal that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.870
 so flashing now the clip like 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.940
 the clash will fire in 1500 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.440
 tours so as soon as I arrived in 2005 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.300
 the little snag job line I'll be 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.770
 that it is necessary to pass my speed it is very 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.770
 simple, see you soon
