so for trotting floats on rivers the
clothes<00:00:44.230> face<00:00:44.500> really<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:44.980> by<00:00:45.129> far<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
clothes face really is by far the

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.279 
clothes face really is by far the
easiest<00:00:45.730> reel<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.660> master<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.750> also<00:00:49.929> very

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
easiest reel to master it's also very

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.930 
easiest reel to master it's also very
important<00:00:50.859> to<00:00:50.890> note<00:00:51.129> that<00:00:51.160> when<00:00:51.519> you've<00:00:51.910> got

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
important to note that when you've got

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.520 
important to note that when you've got
tough<00:00:52.359> conditions<00:00:52.870> like<00:00:53.050> when<00:00:53.199> it's<00:00:53.350> very

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
tough conditions like when it's very

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.069 
tough conditions like when it's very
windy<00:00:53.949> like<00:00:54.129> today<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:55.090> clothes<00:00:55.359> face<00:00:55.660> will

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
windy like today the clothes face will

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.750 
windy like today the clothes face will
help<00:00:56.289> reduce<00:00:56.500> number<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.070> tangles<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.550> get

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
help reduce number of tangles you get

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
help reduce number of tangles you get
because<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.839> fact<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.350> spool<00:00:59.829> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
because of the fact that the spool is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
because of the fact that the spool is
hidden<00:01:02.170> inside<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.920> reel<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.640> prevents<00:01:04.120> lying

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
hidden inside the reel it prevents lying

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.640 
hidden inside the reel it prevents lying
from<00:01:04.629> wrapping<00:01:05.019> around<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.440> reel<00:01:05.620> and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
from wrapping around the reel and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.890 
from wrapping around the reel and
tangling<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:06.880> really<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> hassle-free

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
tangling so it really is a hassle-free

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.780 
tangling so it really is a hassle-free
reel<00:01:08.440> for<00:01:09.310> float<00:01:09.549> fishing<00:01:09.790> on<00:01:10.090> rivers<00:01:11.790> just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
reel for float fishing on rivers just

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.030 
reel for float fishing on rivers just
wanted<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.150> give<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> couple<00:01:13.720> of<00:01:13.810> tips<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
wanted to give you a couple of tips to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.319 
wanted to give you a couple of tips to
think<00:01:15.250> about<00:01:15.490> when<00:01:15.610> you're<00:01:15.729> using<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:16.119> closed

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
think about when you're using a closed

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.039 
think about when you're using a closed
face<00:01:16.600> real<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.250> them<00:01:18.520> which<00:01:18.880> people<00:01:19.840> often

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
face real one of them which people often

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.139 
face real one of them which people often
make<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> mistake<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.310> overfilling<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
make the mistake of is overfilling the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.609 
make the mistake of is overfilling the
reel<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.770> actually<00:01:24.540> under<00:01:25.540> fill<00:01:25.780> my<00:01:26.229> spools

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
reel now I actually under fill my spools

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.910 
reel now I actually under fill my spools
for<00:01:27.280> my<00:01:27.399> clothes<00:01:27.640> face<00:01:27.909> wheels<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.649> case

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
for my clothes face wheels in this case

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.789 
for my clothes face wheels in this case
I've<00:01:30.130> just<00:01:30.310> got<00:01:30.549> eighty<00:01:31.210> meters<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.930> o16<00:01:32.590> line

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
I've just got eighty meters of o16 line

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.510 
I've just got eighty meters of o16 line
on<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.899> what<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.200> does<00:01:35.439> do<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.829> it<00:01:35.860> pretty

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
on and what this does do is it pretty

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.700 
on and what this does do is it pretty
much<00:01:36.700> eliminates<00:01:37.420> any<00:01:37.750> chance<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.500> line

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
much eliminates any chance of the line

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.630 
much eliminates any chance of the line
getting<00:01:39.219> tangled<00:01:39.549> or<00:01:39.850> bedding<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
getting tangled or bedding in and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.819 
getting tangled or bedding in and
causing<00:01:42.640> problems<00:01:43.060> during<00:01:43.329> fishing<00:01:43.840> it's

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
causing problems during fishing it's

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.469 
causing problems during fishing it's
quite<00:01:45.130> common<00:01:45.369> for<00:01:45.579> people<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.909> fill<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.329> up

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
quite common for people to fill it up

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.149 
quite common for people to fill it up
like<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.869> would<00:01:47.020> with<00:01:47.170> an<00:01:47.290> open-faced<00:01:47.860> wheel

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
like you would with an open-faced wheel

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.370 
like you would with an open-faced wheel
and<00:01:48.430> that's<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.759> recipe<00:01:49.090> for<00:01:49.210> disaster<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and that's a recipe for disaster so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.319 
and that's a recipe for disaster so
that's<00:01:50.560> something<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.979> must<00:01:51.219> emphasize<00:01:51.430> is

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
that's something I must emphasize is

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.020 
that's something I must emphasize is
don't<00:01:52.689> put<00:01:52.990> too<00:01:53.140> much<00:01:53.170> line<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> reel<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
don't put too much line on the reel the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.700 
don't put too much line on the reel the
other<00:01:55.180> thing<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.390> will<00:01:55.630> help<00:01:55.750> with<00:01:56.049> which

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
other thing that will help with which

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.289 
other thing that will help with which
can<00:01:56.979> be<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.460> disadvantage<00:01:58.119> with

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
can be a bit of a disadvantage with

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.179 
can be a bit of a disadvantage with
Coast<00:01:58.600> based<00:01:58.869> wheels<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.860> actually

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
Coast based wheels is it actually

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.209 
Coast based wheels is it actually
reduces<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.689> amount<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:02.109> line<00:02:02.380> bedding<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.070> on

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
reduces the amount of line bedding in on

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.580 
reduces the amount of line bedding in on
the<00:02:03.340> spool<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.509> if<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.750> are<00:02:04.930> catching<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.409> few

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
the spool so if you are catching a few

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.529 
the spool so if you are catching a few
better<00:02:05.799> fish<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.729> you're<00:02:06.880> playing<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.299> fish

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
better fish and you're playing the fish

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.109 
better fish and you're playing the fish
the<00:02:08.080> line<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.590> bed<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.789> if<00:02:09.880> you've<00:02:10.030> only

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
the line can bed in so if you've only

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.870 
the line can bed in so if you've only
got<00:02:10.300> 60<00:02:10.930> or<00:02:11.050> 80<00:02:11.140> metres<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.740> line<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
got 60 or 80 metres of line on it the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.180 
got 60 or 80 metres of line on it the
less<00:02:13.209> likely<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.900> these<00:02:14.080> problems<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
less likely to have these problems so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.130 
less likely to have these problems so
that's<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.459> really<00:02:15.670> important<00:02:16.209> important

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that's a really important important

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.809 
that's a really important important
point<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> consider<00:02:17.860> when<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.519> think

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
point to consider when you think

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.789 
point to consider when you think
about<00:02:19.030> first-base<00:02:19.569> wheel<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.260> sounds<00:02:20.590> simple

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
about first-base wheel it sounds simple

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.649 
about first-base wheel it sounds simple
but<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.129> thought<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.459> just<00:02:21.549> explained<00:02:22.239> how<00:02:22.629> to

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
but I thought I just explained how to

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.569 
but I thought I just explained how to
actually<00:02:23.170> set<00:02:23.439> up<00:02:23.469> your<00:02:23.980> new<00:02:24.159> Abu<00:02:24.810> 706<00:02:25.810> wheel

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
actually set up your new Abu 706 wheel

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.459 
actually set up your new Abu 706 wheel
first<00:02:27.579> thing<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.819> need<00:02:27.999> to<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:29.109> take<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
first thing you need to do is take the

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.940 
first thing you need to do is take the
outer<00:02:29.620> housing<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:32.530> you've<00:02:32.680> got<00:02:32.829> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
outer housing on then you've got the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.750 
outer housing on then you've got the
actual<00:02:33.099> rotor<00:02:33.519> here<00:02:34.409> now<00:02:35.409> it's<00:02:36.129> important<00:02:36.639> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
actual rotor here now it's important to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.759 
actual rotor here now it's important to
note<00:02:36.939> that<00:02:36.969> there's<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.329> gear<00:02:37.629> lock<00:02:37.959> situated

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
note that there's a gear lock situated

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.339 
note that there's a gear lock situated
here<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.299> right<00:02:40.480> hand<00:02:40.510> side<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.170> reel

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
here on the right hand side of the reel

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.119 
here on the right hand side of the reel
to<00:02:42.340> remove<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.840> rotor<00:02:44.049> easily<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
to remove the rotor easily and

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
to remove the rotor easily and
effectively<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:46.000> press<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.480> button

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
effectively you just press the button

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.890 
effectively you just press the button
and<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.739> means<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.249> the<00:02:48.569> rotor<00:02:49.569> will

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and that means that the rotor will

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.740 
and that means that the rotor will
unscrew<00:02:50.439> very<00:02:51.400> easily<00:02:51.639> without<00:02:52.120> damaging<00:02:52.599> any

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
unscrew very easily without damaging any

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.830 
unscrew very easily without damaging any
of<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.900> gears<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.739> take<00:02:57.310> your<00:02:57.430> line<00:02:57.609> off<00:02:58.599> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
of the gears so take your line off the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.939 
of the gears so take your line off the
spool<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:00.489> screw<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.000> rotor<00:03:01.209> back<00:03:01.569> on

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
spool and then screw the rotor back on

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.589 
spool and then screw the rotor back on
now<00:03:02.949> you<00:03:03.010> need<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.370> ensure<00:03:03.909> that<00:03:03.939> you<00:03:04.209> screw<00:03:04.480> it

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
now you need to ensure that you screw it

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.959 
now you need to ensure that you screw it
on<00:03:04.719> nice<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:04.959> tight<00:03:05.409> so<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.040> ensure<00:03:06.669> that<00:03:06.849> the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
on nice and tight so I ensure that the

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.360 
on nice and tight so I ensure that the
drags<00:03:07.239> well<00:03:07.510> done<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.829> then<00:03:08.919> I'll<00:03:09.069> tighten

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
drags well done and then I'll tighten

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.729 
drags well done and then I'll tighten
the<00:03:09.699> rotor<00:03:09.879> against<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.719> drag<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.439> you<00:03:11.530> can

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the rotor against the drag so you can

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.740 
the rotor against the drag so you can
see<00:03:11.919> now<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.159> drugs<00:03:12.489> working<00:03:13.000> but<00:03:13.599> more

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
see now the drugs working but more

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
see now the drugs working but more
importantly<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.439> rotor<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:15.400> nice<00:03:15.699> and<00:03:15.909> secure

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
importantly the rotor is nice and secure

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.030 
importantly the rotor is nice and secure
so<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.049> won't<00:03:17.230> come<00:03:17.469> loose<00:03:17.650> when<00:03:17.889> you're

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
so it won't come loose when you're

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.179 
so it won't come loose when you're
fishing<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:20.469> it's<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.889> matter<00:03:20.919> of

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
fishing and then it's just a matter of

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.749 
fishing and then it's just a matter of
simply<00:03:21.730> passing<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:22.689> line<00:03:23.340> back<00:03:24.340> through<00:03:24.639> the

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:24.759 
simply passing the line back through the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:30.240 
simply passing the line back through the
housing<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.870> putting<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.530> housing<00:03:29.889> back<00:03:30.009> on

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
housing and putting the housing back on

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.939 
housing and putting the housing back on
so<00:03:31.030> there<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.269> go<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:31.959> line<00:03:32.169> comes<00:03:32.680> from<00:03:32.859> the

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
so there you go the line comes from the

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.920 
so there you go the line comes from the
front<00:03:33.189> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> reel<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:34.239> by<00:03:34.359> pressing<00:03:34.629> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
front of the reel and by pressing the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.979 
front of the reel and by pressing the
release<00:03:35.560> button<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.970> lines<00:03:37.180> free<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.810> that's

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
release button the lines free so that's

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.830 
release button the lines free so that's
like<00:03:38.169> opening<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> barrel<00:03:38.949> arm<00:03:39.129> on<00:03:39.310> your<00:03:39.400> reel

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
like opening the barrel arm on your reel

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.539 
like opening the barrel arm on your reel
and<00:03:40.840> then<00:03:41.079> just<00:03:41.349> to<00:03:41.439> simply<00:03:41.859> engage<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
and then just to simply engage the

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.479 
and then just to simply engage the
barrel<00:03:42.879> arm<00:03:43.109> turn<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.290> handle<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.949> you're

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
barrel arm turn the handle and you're

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.089 
barrel arm turn the handle and you're
back<00:03:45.639> in<00:03:45.669> business<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.530> really<00:03:47.829> is<00:03:47.949> a<00:03:47.979> very

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
back in business so it really is a very

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.610 
back in business so it really is a very
very<00:03:48.400> simple<00:03:49.000> process<00:03:49.509> in<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.019> very<00:03:50.049> simple

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
very simple process in a very simple

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.039 
very simple process in a very simple
reel<00:03:50.829> one<00:03:51.729> that<00:03:51.939> takes<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.540> little<00:03:52.659> bit<00:03:52.780> of

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
reel one that takes a little bit of

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.599 
reel one that takes a little bit of
getting<00:03:53.349> used<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.919> you've<00:03:54.069> never<00:03:54.220> used<00:03:54.340> one

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
getting used to if you've never used one

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.670 
getting used to if you've never used one
before<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.609> as<00:03:57.729> I<00:03:57.849> mentioned<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:59.139> closed<00:03:59.379> face

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
biggest advantage as you can see it's

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.439

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
those face wheels make the operation so

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.230 
those face wheels make the operation so
much<00:04:54.759> easier

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.900
