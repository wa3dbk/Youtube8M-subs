00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
close actually just cuz there's actually
a<00:00:23.910> slim<00:00:24.210> chance<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.990> destroy<00:00:25.590> itself<00:00:26.070> if

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
a slim chance that can destroy itself if

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
a slim chance that can destroy itself if
you<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:27.150> too<00:00:27.210> close<00:00:29.420> yeah<00:00:30.420> sorry<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.900> still<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
little sick but you can see there's some

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510 
little sick but you can see there's some
spawners<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.250> there's<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
spawners in there and then there's a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.869 
spawners in there and then there's a
chest<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.660> prizes<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
chest right there which has prizes in it

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.889 
chest right there which has prizes in it
anyway<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.750> tell

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
anyway so I don't know if you can tell

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.250 
anyway so I don't know if you can tell
what<00:00:40.020> those<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:41.809> actually<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.930> enough

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
what those are actually you know enough

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.540 
what those are actually you know enough
people<00:00:43.410> will<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:43.980> figure<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
people will probably figure them out I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
people will probably figure them out I
might<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:44.969> well<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.329> tell<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.870> here

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
might as well just tell you right here

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.770 
might as well just tell you right here
which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> those<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.340> primed<00:00:47.780> TNT

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
which is that those are primed TNT

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.470 
which is that those are primed TNT
spawners<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.910> those<00:00:51.059> using

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
spawners so you can only get those using

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.590 
spawners so you can only get those using
the<00:00:51.510> toomanyitems<00:00:51.899> mod<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.600> anyway

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the toomanyitems mod which I have anyway

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420 
the toomanyitems mod which I have anyway
so<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.230> those<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.860> yes<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> does

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
so I put those there and yes that does

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.319 
so I put those there and yes that does
mean<00:00:57.020> TNT<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.500> random<00:00:59.010> prime<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.699> TNT<00:01:00.030> will

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
mean TNT well random prime to TNT will

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
mean TNT well random prime to TNT will
randomly<00:01:00.780> appear<00:01:01.289> around<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.829> black<00:01:02.070> hole

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
randomly appear around that black hole

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.850 
randomly appear around that black hole
when<00:01:02.730> you're<00:01:02.879> near<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.080> there's<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
when you're near it and there's also a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
when you're near it and there's also a
slim<00:01:05.070> chance<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.909> destroy<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
slim chance that it can destroy the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
slim chance that it can destroy the
spawners<00:01:06.720> itself<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> destroy<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.700> chest

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
spawners itself and destroy the chest

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
spawners itself and destroy the chest
with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> prizes<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> be

but I realized that pretty much a
hundred<00:01:32.490> percent<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.509> world<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> I've

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
hundred percent of this world that I've

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
hundred percent of this world that I've
made<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.770> completely<00:01:35.189> off<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.450> designs

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
made has been completely off my designs

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.560 
made has been completely off my designs
and<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:36.810> inputs<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.619> ooh<00:01:38.490> secret<00:01:38.939> emeralds

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and my inputs and ooh secret emeralds

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
and my inputs and ooh secret emeralds
that<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.229> guys<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.590> saw<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.250> realized

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that you guys just saw but I realized

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
that you guys just saw but I realized
that's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.899> since

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's not really how it should be since

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
that's not really how it should be since
I'm<00:01:43.409> thinking<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.939> I'm<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> am<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> last

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I'm thinking this I'm like I am the last

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'm thinking this I'm like I am the last
person<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> play<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.210> map

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
person that would want to play this map

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
person that would want to play this map
because<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.720> mean<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.049> where<00:01:49.320> everything

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
because I mean I know where everything

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.319 
because I mean I know where everything
is<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.399> those<00:01:50.579> surprising<00:01:51.119> stuff

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is like we're all those surprising stuff

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.730 
is like we're all those surprising stuff
is<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.570> wanted<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.990> guys's<00:01:55.350> input

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
is so I wanted to get your guys's input

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.249 
is so I wanted to get your guys's input
on<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.909> should<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> next<00:01:57.780> thing<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.020> put<00:01:58.229> in

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
on what should be a next thing I put in

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.550 
on what should be a next thing I put in
so<00:01:58.770> my<00:01:59.579> own<00:01:59.729> ideas<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:02.540> slime<00:02:03.540> world<00:02:04.110> where

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so my own ideas are a slime world where

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
so my own ideas are a slime world where
I<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:04.920> much<00:02:05.100> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.820> slimes<00:02:06.210> can

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
I pretty much make it so just slimes can

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
I pretty much make it so just slimes can
spawn<00:02:06.719> which<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.200> fairly<00:02:07.590> sure<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.250> do

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
spawn which I'm fairly sure I can do

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.619 
spawn which I'm fairly sure I can do
using<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.590> mcedit<00:02:10.590> filter

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
using some kind of mcedit filter

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.239 
using some kind of mcedit filter
but<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:12.989> secondarily<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.859> also<00:02:14.609> wanted<00:02:15.329> um

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249 
but then secondarily I also wanted um

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.379 
but then secondarily I also wanted um
what<00:02:17.249> was<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:17.519> thing<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.849> have<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.120> mind

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:18.389 
what was the other thing I have in mind

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.479 
what was the other thing I have in mind
oh<00:02:18.659> yeah<00:02:19.019> an<00:02:19.200> all<00:02:19.349> water<00:02:19.709> planet<00:02:20.280> would<00:02:20.459> be

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
oh yeah an all water planet would be

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.979 
oh yeah an all water planet would be
pretty<00:02:20.819> cool<00:02:20.999> where<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> kind<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.569> make<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:21.719> like

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
pretty cool where I kind of make it like

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.780 
pretty cool where I kind of make it like
I<00:02:22.230> did<00:02:22.499> with<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> Sun<00:02:23.040> where<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.340> goes<00:02:23.459> glass

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I did with the Sun where it goes glass

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910 
I did with the Sun where it goes glass
and<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.150> lava<00:02:24.389> and<00:02:24.719> then<00:02:25.590> there's<00:02:25.799> actually

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and then lava and then there's actually

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.699 
and then lava and then there's actually
some<00:02:26.280> more<00:02:26.430> layers<00:02:26.639> inside<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> Sun<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.409> I

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
some more layers inside the Sun but I

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.740 
some more layers inside the Sun but I
don't<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.219> give<00:02:29.340> away<00:02:29.459> too<00:02:29.579> much<00:02:29.909> anyway

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
don't want to give away too much anyway

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.149 
don't want to give away too much anyway
so<00:02:30.780> I'd<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.079> that<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.500> water<00:02:31.709> world<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
so I'd do that with the water world I

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.949 
so I'd do that with the water world I
maybe<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.969> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.359> bubble<00:02:33.599> in<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
maybe have like a little bubble in the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.259 
maybe have like a little bubble in the
center<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.469> the<00:02:34.500> prize<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.760> some<00:02:36.090> kind

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
center with the prize in it or some kind

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.539 
center with the prize in it or some kind
of<00:02:36.299> spawner<00:02:36.719> I<00:02:36.750> don't<00:02:37.019> know<00:02:37.489> but<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.519> think

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
of spawner I don't know but I think

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.009 
of spawner I don't know but I think
that'd<00:02:38.849> be<00:02:39.000> pretty<00:02:39.180> cool<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.989> I

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
that'd be pretty cool I don't know I

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.149 
that'd be pretty cool I don't know I
could<00:02:40.169> make<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.379> off<00:02:40.469> in<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.680> direction<00:02:40.829> or

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
could make it off in that direction or

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.530 
could make it off in that direction or
something<00:02:41.489> there's<00:02:41.730> nothing<00:02:41.999> behind<00:02:42.150> Earth

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
something there's nothing behind Earth

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.440 
something there's nothing behind Earth
at<00:02:42.749> the<00:02:42.840> moment<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> yeah<00:02:44.969> those<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.209> two

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
at the moment so yeah those are two

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.640 
at the moment so yeah those are two
things<00:02:45.689> that<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.049> saw<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.500> then

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
things that I just saw it but then

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.740 
things that I just saw it but then
please<00:02:47.129> give<00:02:47.310> me<00:02:47.370> your<00:02:47.400> own<00:02:47.639> designs<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.480> want

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
please give me your own designs I I want

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.479 
please give me your own designs I I want
to<00:02:48.840> see<00:02:48.989> what<00:02:49.169> you<00:02:49.379> guys<00:02:49.560> come<00:02:49.829> up<00:02:49.889> with<00:02:50.189> this

to see what you guys come up with this

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.729 
to see what you guys come up with this
input<00:02:50.969> for<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.269> world<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:51.900> literally

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
input for this world because literally

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.439 
input for this world because literally
this<00:02:52.889> is<00:02:53.010> all<00:02:53.129> been<00:02:53.280> my<00:02:53.400> design<00:02:53.730> which<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.239> feel

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.240 
this is all been my design which I feel
like<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.780> shouldn't<00:02:55.319> be<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.650> way<00:02:55.949> it<00:02:56.069> should

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
like it shouldn't be that way it should

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.099 
like it shouldn't be that way it should
be<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.639> of<00:02:56.699> like<00:02:56.909> my<00:02:57.090> viewers<00:02:57.419> input<00:02:57.810> so
