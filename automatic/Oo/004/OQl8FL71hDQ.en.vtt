00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello everyone today i am off screen 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.120
 I want to share with you my find 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 in front of you are gels varnishes that is it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.330
 blue sky copy shellac 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.119
 means all contacts where you can order 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.760
 where i ordered i will leave you in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 infobox so if you're interested 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.070
 get my opinion all detailed 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 detailed then stay with me all 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 pleasant viewing 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.250
 and so let's get started literally 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.100
 I recently stumbled upon these 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 wonderful gel polishes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 This is an analogue of the original prices of the dacha 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.520
 I know shellac is present 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 Not all the colors of course I bought myself 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.090
 you can see here 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.030
 daisies are not considered to be 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 such red pink 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.720
 coral who does not know and china is closer 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.729
 it means this is ours 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.299
 top coating on which we put in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.850
 the end 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.729
 This is the base coat that we wear in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.790
 early they unfortunately have you but all 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.979
 colors in black bottles but there are 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.150
 such here are three color that is to me 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.680
 loved these three colors 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 the only one and these two colors they 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.479
 such know translucent that colors under 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 number 80 502 and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.970
 80 526 here they need populated layer of 3 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 so you get this more or less 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 rich color to this color of complaints 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 he is not very bright at all 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
 straight pink girlish so me very 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 liked 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.720
 means the body in terms of endurance that I 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.939
 I want to tell you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.780
 worn like a regular shellac I wear it 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.630
 three weeks 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.630
 Now if you somehow 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 to demonstrate 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.960
 Now I will try to focus my 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.580
 camera or not now one minute then 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.160
 I have now somewhere husband and varnish 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.280
 somewhere around I made it for two weeks 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 backwards 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.070
 so you can watch here at me 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.060
 with check design me red so 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 I donâ€™t grow a fly agaric 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.220
 very much that is to look as if 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 only yesterday did that is very 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.020
 cool, I am generally very pleased 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.920
 me so how was it because 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.080
 do not give a lot of money to the salon and what 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 I did it I decided to get myself 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.410
 Here are such wonderful varnishes, I think 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.100
 that my color palette will be soon 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.410
 expand what else to say about these varnishes in 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.260
 the plan is not much not very light in 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.750
 basically all colors are a copy of cnd again 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.330
 they shellac hair's breadth straight one in 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.690
 one 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.730
 Looks beautiful leg. 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.000
 nothing exfoliates heats well also in 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.980
 lamp me lamp 9 watts of it and to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.170
 Sorry you didn't get me thinking in 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.660
 principle you are all familiar with the lamp that is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.850
 this slag quietly dried in 9 watts 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.030
 that is, not necessarily acquires itself 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.610
 pandora 32nd from here is why girls 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.890
 who likes to do gel polish no no 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.709
 be afraid try very cool 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.430
 the tool is very cool that is, they have 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.380
 sheet on a very large palette of colors and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.090
 very easy everything is done so 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.810
