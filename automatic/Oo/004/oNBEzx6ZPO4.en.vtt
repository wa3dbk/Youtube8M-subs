00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, I think it says that you created the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.309
 Radiohead's got an examiner for this. 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.940
 Come to class today and today I found 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.099
 how to skate on the bad floor and with the floor 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 Bad, I'm going to use the Portuguese stone now. 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.420
 with an example but this technique works 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 for any bad floor anyone 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 that is not super smooth 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 ok then the theory is this you do not skate 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 normal pointed Portuguese pedro no 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.550
 patina with that momentum of score 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.790
 that normal speed skating 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.489
 this does not work on the bad floor you have 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.340
 that to do very fast the steps is 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 very little time at home booty not to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.270
 take all those holes across the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.320
 show 1 and then we'll talk but look at the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.870
 step speed is only five here 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 1234 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 29 with 2 34 c 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.470
 so they go very fast 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.690
 you can not practice statically 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 advice paralleled 12345 who government 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.380
 It's very fast with 2 345 notes. I 'm not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 lifting this knee when a whole 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.010
 leg 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.970
 I stayed down and I get up getting 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.240
 below 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.729
 then getting macho does not lift and then the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 steps do with a view position in the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.800
 martins streets 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.869
 ok 500 internal because then on camera 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.700
 slow you go to one and 12 3 and 4 so the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:44.330
 knee covering the finger so it is not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.330
 slow is not this kind of condemnation 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.420
 who gets much faster 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.390
 Until then this is the secret to any 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.590
 thinking it's bad because he thinks the floor 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.080
 on fire 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.050
 You do not want to burn your wheels then. 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.149
 You arrive raising well what I expect. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.280
 may this Judoka please share 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.960
 with their groups and agents in the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.960
 next party, bye
