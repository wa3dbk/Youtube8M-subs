00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to the video 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 from me I am to the app store and to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.460
 today the review on the beats by dr dre 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 solo hd I also had lee lately 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 mixa in the test because you have the video for it 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.740
 have not seen just look below 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.049
 in the video description or clicks 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 here on the video then again 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 forwarded a comparison video 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.910
 between the two headphones will too 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 Coming soon you can just do it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.060
 times with the review 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.099
 First of all, I use it now 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 I can give you the design for the sound now 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.429
 not too much so if you are 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.529
 want to know how the headphones 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.690
 Just listen to the next one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.320
 media market or saturn and tests the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.329
 down there just with the review 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.190
 from the outside we have this here now 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.399
 blue as such, the blue refers 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 model this is the new generation now 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 with the new generation are also very 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.539
 many other options to driving 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 come 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.780
 However, it is now here at the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.430
 headphones no monsters anymore if you 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.649
 want to know which color from the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.180
 possibilities so there are just looks 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.359
 below the video description i feel 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.480
 me the whole one else the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.189
 from the outside are now plastic and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.400
 ten anyway in my opinion 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.310
 pretty chic from the inside now 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.140
 white and the ear are here too 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.740
 very soft so the bridge is not on like that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.420
 or so can flow very comfortably with the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 definitely music for a while 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 otherwise you can hear here now 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.829
 quite arbitrary so imagine two 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.439
 hinges you can do it all here 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.000
 pull it out again ever 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.439
 How big your head is 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270
 and if the time on the road 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.130
 I just want to take this with me 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.470
 so fold up and then into the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 bag of water is included 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.979
 put it in and then take it with you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.369
 then not too much space away 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.170
 as you can see here now 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 we now have here on the left 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.670
 side then the connection for the latches 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.960
 I can now plug again here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.920
 briefly demonstrate how the whole 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.719
 would look like 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.119
 as we are here now at the new 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.520
 generation only this cable here with the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.979
 control talk the whole thing comes here then 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.210
 looks to the left side in here 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.209
 then that's pretty fancy 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.819
 and then here as just mentioned this 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.680
 controllers here in the middle now have 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.440
 here we can with this red button 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.900
 then play the music pause 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 a track back and jumps each 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.190
 after which gesture occurs 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 can also regulate the volume and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.220
 here on the back is then too 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.870
 again a microphone installed 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.360
 So even if you open the headphones 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.180
 could and should get a call 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.970
 then lift off the whole and then comfortably 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.040
 phoning about this microphone here 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.920
 the other end of the cable then looks 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.239
 So that's what your device will come from 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.950
 off I can now times 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.519
 Demonstrate what that will look like 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.010
 would 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.510
 So you just connect here and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.980
 then it's right here at yours 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.580
 gets on and actually pulls too 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.019
 pretty chic out of cable itself can 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.390
 you say that is definitely 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.800
 were pretty well made is therefore 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.870
 it definitely has a very high one 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.330
 quality and you can tell that too 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.080
 that she is hardly knot so me 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.959
 noticed 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.700
 even if I just like that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.890
 encrusted and packed in the bag and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.810
 then take out there is no knot in it 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.370
 not like others 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.950
 cheap headphones boot directly if you 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.690
 once the bag grabs already 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.549
 are completely knotted on everyone 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.049
 case a very positive point and yes 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.019
 otherwise that's what I say already 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.160
 from the construction ago 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.079
 I can not talk to the sound now 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.940
 all pay a lot so I can get you on 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.160
 Be sure to drop the headphones here 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 and pretty comfortable so I had 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.890
 the already several hours and the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.799
 did not start sometime too 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.180
 do not press or ears either 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.070
 somehow started to hurt 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.049
 therefore we are pretty much in any case 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.510
 good for the people who spend hours listening to music 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.640
 Listen or for the people like me 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.989
 synonymous videos cut as but can 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.880
 Heading here is pretty good 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.769
 videos cut because everything is very 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.790
 Can hear well and not 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.010
 press as I said 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.900
 and otherwise if you want to know 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.250
 as they sound simple as I said 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.230
 to the next media market and saturn 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.019
 go for a short while 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.160
 listen to a bit of music and then you can 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.579
 you see if they like you or you 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.560
 Not 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.959
 Of course it depends on what 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.250
 for a music direction i hear hip 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 hop i can definitely bring you 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.359
 recommend this headphones here 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.609
 so other music direction would have you 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.109
 Just try it out and otherwise it was 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.459
 to the review if you also this 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.139
 Just want to buy headphones 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.970
