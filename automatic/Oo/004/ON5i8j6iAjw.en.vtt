00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that is the Y look at that paper just

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
that is the Y look at that paper just
rolling<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.570> tumbleweeds<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
rolling like tumbleweeds and that is the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
rolling like tumbleweeds and that is the
actual<00:01:05.519> controller<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.720> looks

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
actual controller this thing looks

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340 
actual controller this thing looks
pretty<00:01:07.110> cool<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.400> say<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.820> myself

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
pretty cool if I do say so myself

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.120
