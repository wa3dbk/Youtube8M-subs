tabs<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.079> have<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.409> 10<00:01:28.590> *<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.219> if<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
tabs you can have like 10 * going if you

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.339 
tabs you can have like 10 * going if you
