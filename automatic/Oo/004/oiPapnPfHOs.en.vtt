00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.190 
on a project that I thought you guys
would<00:00:04.560> like<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.830> know<00:00:04.980> about<00:00:05.130> it's<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.330> model

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
would like to know about it's a model

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.100 
would like to know about it's a model
engine<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.830> getting<00:00:08.550> into<00:00:08.910> metalworking<00:00:09.630> so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
engine I'm getting into metalworking so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.260 
engine I'm getting into metalworking so
I'll<00:00:10.349> show<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.130> done

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.180 

so<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.390> engine<00:00:16.660> I'm<00:00:16.780> tryna<00:00:17.710> make<00:00:17.890> right<00:00:18.160> now

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
so the engine I'm tryna make right now

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.190 
so the engine I'm tryna make right now
is<00:00:18.670> an<00:00:19.150> inline<00:00:19.630> twin<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:22.090> pistons<00:00:22.510> are<00:00:22.660> 180

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
is an inline twin the pistons are 180

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.010 
is an inline twin the pistons are 180
degrees<00:00:23.320> apart<00:00:24.040> and<00:00:24.550> you<00:00:25.360> can<00:00:25.390> see<00:00:25.689> where<00:00:25.869> the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
degrees apart and you can see where the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
degrees apart and you can see where the
two<00:00:26.400> Pistons<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:28.240> cylinders<00:00:28.689> will<00:00:28.960> be<00:00:29.169> so<00:00:29.800> let

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
two Pistons the cylinders will be so let

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.100 
two Pistons the cylinders will be so let
me<00:00:30.130> show<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:31.779> I'm<00:00:31.869> going<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.019> be

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
me show you that what I'm going to be

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.400 
me show you that what I'm going to be
using<00:00:32.470> our<00:00:34.059> Oh<00:00:34.510> for<00:00:35.470> nine<00:00:35.710> cylinders<00:00:37.410> so

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
using our Oh for nine cylinders so

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.330 
using our Oh for nine cylinders so
again<00:00:38.920> these<00:00:39.100> are<00:00:39.160> really<00:00:39.309> small<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.059> can<00:00:40.330> see

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
again these are really small you can see

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340 
again these are really small you can see
the<00:00:42.340> size<00:00:42.580> of<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:45.250> some<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:46.269> guess<00:00:47.200> they

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the size of that I got some I guess they

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.850 
the size of that I got some I guess they
call<00:00:47.500> them<00:00:47.649> mufflers<00:00:48.129> for<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:50.559> will<00:00:50.710> be

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
call them mufflers for it so one will be

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.470 
call them mufflers for it so one will be
there

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.540 

and<00:00:55.660> I<00:00:56.500> have<00:00:56.710> another<00:00:57.010> one<00:00:59.159> that<00:01:00.159> was<00:01:00.309> over

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
and I have another one that was over

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
and I have another one that was over
there

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.840 

and<00:01:04.969> the<00:01:05.969> actual<00:01:06.299> engine<00:01:06.780> itself<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.850> shy

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and the actual engine itself is just shy

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.459 
and the actual engine itself is just shy
of<00:01:08.880> three<00:01:09.780> inches<00:01:10.850> long<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:13.259> that's<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
of three inches long so that's a

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.099 
of three inches long so that's a
backplate<00:01:14.009> not<00:01:15.000> finished<00:01:15.390> yet<00:01:15.539> that's<00:01:15.899> going

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
backplate not finished yet that's going

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.120 
backplate not finished yet that's going
to<00:01:16.170> slide<00:01:16.409> right<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:18.500> I'm<00:01:19.500> working<00:01:20.009> on

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to slide right in there I'm working on

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.969 
to slide right in there I'm working on
the<00:01:20.819> crankshaft<00:01:21.179> right<00:01:21.719> now<00:01:21.899> so<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.679> is<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the crankshaft right now so this is the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.969 
the crankshaft right now so this is the
output<00:01:23.569> this<00:01:24.569> one's<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.350> done<00:01:25.679> i

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
output this one's just about done i

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.999 
output this one's just about done i
milled<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:28.140> piston<00:01:28.979> relief<00:01:30.679> so<00:01:31.679> that<00:01:31.709> guy

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
milled the piston relief so that guy

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.059 
milled the piston relief so that guy
will<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.429> there<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.270> show<00:01:33.959> you<00:01:34.069> how

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
I can show you what the pistons look

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.950 
I can show you what the pistons look
like

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
were a little spark plug type boots that

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.679 
were a little spark plug type boots that
you<00:02:05.890> can<00:02:06.159> put<00:02:06.340> on<00:02:06.460> top<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:07.240> engines<00:02:07.600> not

so forgive me am I really messy
workbench<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:11.160> have<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.730> up<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.120> cleaning

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
workbench I have to get up for cleaning

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
workbench I have to get up for cleaning
at<00:03:12.570> one<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.810> these<00:03:12.930> days<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.170> here's<00:03:14.130> my

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
at one of these days but here's my

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
at one of these days but here's my
milling<00:03:14.640> machine<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.240> an<00:03:15.420> x2<00:03:15.960> for<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> those

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
milling machine it's an x2 for the those

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.680 
milling machine it's an x2 for the those
of<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.100> know<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.720> part<00:03:19.110> mounted

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
of you that know I have my part mounted

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.800 
of you that know I have my part mounted
on<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.780> small<00:03:22.470> machinist<00:03:23.040> vise<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:24.570> just

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
on a small machinist vise and I'm just

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.640 
on a small machinist vise and I'm just
slowly<00:03:25.110> making<00:03:25.560> passes<00:03:26.240> down<00:03:27.240> my<00:03:27.450> part<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:28.170> get

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
slowly making passes down my part to get

00:03:28.650 --> 00:04:03.080 
slowly making passes down my part to get
to<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.860> finished<00:03:29.160> dimensions

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.730 

so<00:04:04.090> it's<00:04:04.240> always<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.480> good<00:04:04.630> idea<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:05.020> stop<00:04:05.380> and

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
so it's always a good idea to stop and

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.740 
so it's always a good idea to stop and
take<00:04:06.460> measurements<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:07.120> your<00:04:07.180> parts<00:04:07.570> you

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
take measurements of your parts you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.470 
take measurements of your parts you
don't<00:04:07.870> take<00:04:08.110> off<00:04:08.260> too<00:04:08.290> much<00:04:08.590> material<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.450> I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
don't take off too much material so I

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.100 
don't take off too much material so I
have<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.870> height<00:04:11.140> gauge<00:04:11.440> on<00:04:11.860> my<00:04:12.550> mill<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.150> I'm

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
have a height gauge on my mill and I'm

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.140 
have a height gauge on my mill and I'm
going<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.290> zero<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.670> top<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.060> my

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
going to zero it on the top of my

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.580 
going to zero it on the top of my
workpiece<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.049> then<00:04:17.920> I'll<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.280> able<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:19.590> move

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
workpiece and then I'll be able to move

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.670 
workpiece and then I'll be able to move
it<00:04:20.799> lower<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.370> get<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.820> reading<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.540> how<00:04:23.530> much

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
it lower and get a reading of how much

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.240 
it lower and get a reading of how much
material<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.190> took<00:04:24.400> off<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.650> I'll<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:26.980> touch

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
material I took off so I'll just touch

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.680 
material I took off so I'll just touch
it<00:04:27.280> off<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:28.030> top<00:04:28.270> of<00:04:28.300> my<00:04:28.480> workpiece<00:04:33.240> I'll<00:04:34.240> zero

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
it off the top of my workpiece I'll zero

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.730 
it off the top of my workpiece I'll zero
it<00:04:37.080> I'll<00:04:38.080> come<00:04:38.530> back<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.490> part<00:04:40.350> I'm<00:04:41.350> taking

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
it I'll come back to the part I'm taking

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.480 
it I'll come back to the part I'm taking
material<00:04:42.220> off<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:43.800> lower<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:45.100> until<00:04:45.370> it

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
material off of lower it until it

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.230 
material off of lower it until it
touches<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.710> spin<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.400> height<00:04:48.580> gauge<00:04:48.880> around

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
touches now spin the height gauge around

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.510 
touches now spin the height gauge around
because<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:50.110> don't<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.650> enough<00:04:50.710> room<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.250> look

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
because I don't have enough room to look

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.240 
because I don't have enough room to look
at<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:51.760> properly<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.950> am<00:04:53.950> looking<00:04:54.430> for<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.180> point

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
at it properly I am looking for a point
