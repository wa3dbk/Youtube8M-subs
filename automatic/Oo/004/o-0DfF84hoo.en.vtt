00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.138
 Welcome to the intensive WoW course for the Frost Death Knight. 

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:14.177
 Here, we will give you a brief summary of what you will need to do to start 

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:17.513
 to play with a Frost death knight on level 90. 

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:22.747
 These have two primary resources: runes and runic power. 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.192
 Most faculties cost runes and there are three types of runes. 

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.747
 For this character are: Profana, Frost and Death 

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.246
 a special rune that can be used as another rune of any kind. 

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.890
 By using your runes in faculties, you will be generating Runic Power 

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:42.893
 which can be used in other attacks. 

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:47.703
 They can use a two-handed weapon or two one-handed weapons 

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.476
 and the option you choose affects the way you play. 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.316
 In this video, we will focus on the dual grip. 

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:59.623
 You must be in Frost Presence and activate the Winter Horn. 

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:03.412
 Then, start with Plague Strike, which costs a Profane Rune 

00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:05.794
 and the disease Plague of blood applies. 

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:09.676
 Plague strike is not a very strong blow on its own, so you should use it 

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:12.011
 if you need to reapply Blood Plaster. 

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:15.442
 Then, you must use Asolar, which inflicts a large amount of damage 

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:19.615
 but it is something expensive: a Rune of Frost and a Profana. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.811
 For that reason, you should only use Asolar when you have 

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:25.998
 an extra profane rune and you do not need to use Plague Strike. 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:30.723
 If not, you must spend your Runes of Frost and Death in Howling Blast. 

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:35.699
 On targets of less than 35% of health use Soul Reaper, no Howling Blast 

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:37.902
 when it is not in cooldown. 

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:42.743
 By following that basic rotation, you will generate Runic Power 

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:44.837
 that you can spend on Frost Strike. 

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:47.946
 Use it when you are waiting for your runes to recharge. 

00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:51.013
 There are also a couple of proc effects to take care of. 

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.232
 Cunando uses Asolar, there is a chance that it appears 

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:55.982
 a free howling Explosion. 

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:59.240
 Use Howling Blast immediately when that happens. 

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:02.661
 Your automatic attacks can activate Machine kill 

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.037
 which guarantees a critical hit in Asolar or Frost Strike. 

00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:10.069
 If you have a profane Rune to spare ready to Solve 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.084
 It uses killing machine. 

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.606
 Otherwise, you must use Frost Strike immediately. 

00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:19.606
 There is more to learn if you want to perfect your CdM 

00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.184
 but we hope that this introduction will serve you 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.137
 to go in the right direction. 

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:26.286
 Once you control the basics 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:31.312
 It's a good idea to spend time reading your book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:34.359
 to know the other faculties that we did not mention here. 

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:38.279
 We hope you enjoyed, see you in Draenor!
