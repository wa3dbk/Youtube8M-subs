00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.730
 however, it is a question of

 cleared 850 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.640
 depends on it yes 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 because otherwise it'll be the boss that because on this point 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 against all odds 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.810
 of Montpellier has become a cult 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.810
 it was not the first time that both simple and clear 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.550
 as explained 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.100
 aerial side 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100

 abd al gore 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.480
 in order to study it before not to hold the shock 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.380
 tecmo mac 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 his presence to make a publicity 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
 weird 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.960
 who talked about the ocde 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.020
 the revival of the French language the French culture counts the weight the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 radio in France that it's done 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.540
 when we started the changed 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.520
 four and a half years 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.350
 there was no francophone program and for 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.729
 in the last two years a lot of people are starting to 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.219
 call by asking a lot 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.719
 little information on cd compatible mp3 or france belgium 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.659
 and we know that it was not necessarily French but guillaume 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.709
 american some do not even speak french but do you know me from 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.249
 three months you learned at school he was very interested in the 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.319
 French culture 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.829
 and that these two blocks for a little more than year by year what are the 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.779
 types of artists on my team 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.829
 French and what you are amazed by the level of culture and champions 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.889
 for police apel to receive young men were in place serge 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:37.619
 gainsbourg 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.969
 for the first time that someone called me telling me about 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.069
 serce of hazebrouck 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.129
 so I was really surprised 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.849
 who would recognize no gift in the usa has a lot of people 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.650
 know the britain solar 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.669
 magic show 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.259
 for m although tempting by the abandonment of the Spaniards but for many people 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.599
 to appreciate this style of music 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.840
 anne few word legends generally all equipped with the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.540
 France explains how and when we talk a lot exploited made mats 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.969
 with cars and by France 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.540
 they are so many engines is made by France in mind for culture 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.369
 French 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:07.279
 so for them 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.220
 the profit of a month a myth gold for the north of the usa 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.369
 or many larger cities in Quebec 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.600
 or at least their grandparents came from Quebec 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.530
 so for us 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.769
 French culture following the 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.570
 the wolf 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.460
 a mix between them the culture of their grandparents who come from 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.209
 québec inc 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.629
 as well as the goal of the continent France 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.969
 the municipality was too short the delay that Quebecers dream 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.090
 she that this commune that would propose 3 Franco-American committees 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.489
 of people who are living in French culture as 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.779
 ancestors came from Quebec 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.960
 and then this new 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.080
 two generations of franco taxes me and marca kiliç will they come from 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.209
 country to francophones france belgium 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.849
 there is more and more French because it is in the same case but on this 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.840
 ramp was committing too local cool for me what do you feel the revival the 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.909
 role earlier 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.369
 refined rocket dallest more and more bands 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.709
 I sing in French 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.709
 as I would have expected% 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.739
 percent in April finally 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.819
 so we have a lot a lot of time 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.039
 big points no music 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.129
 to French dolphin singing more and more not much but more 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:22.749
 in addition to a dream of a lot of darty the road of writers who come to do 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.749
 readings in French 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.169
 and percent and then more and more people are trying to learn French 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.300
 that dates from there are people here on the radio 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.189
 on the one hand and by night two years ago and who are well tried to learn 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.209
 two french people aged 25 and learn french for this holiday these 

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:40.809
 collections so have how they translate on revival and may it 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.099
 would not be surprised by the magnitude 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.639
 the meal the revival of French culture 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.889
 butter through bands of rap music that sings in 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:49.620
 French 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.380
 francophone artists who come from the eurocopter ceo ceo ceo 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.710
 pass in the mile 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.990
 and the written delay of the afp who has just made readings in French 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 have more and more people who find themselves for alain madelin seems to 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.210
 more and more feel that he's doing what she's done surprising to you that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.069
 you think I'm doing a magnitude that you did not imagine me what you 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.030
 qatar valuations I moved here seven years ago in 1999 there was a very very 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.309
 good 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:16.239
 the break in as much as possible in the country more and more people are in 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:17.699
 getting organized 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.879
 show that French culture it's a lot of people a huge package of 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.479
 fric spoke in French 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.900
 here are some years to come 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.020
 by the integration in the English language they are this factory 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.490
 generation the two-year-old two album a 30-year-old 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.809
 quito - what is French 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.059
 funcom is tenured and a crust will express it 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.839
 format support and content 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.050
 so there is a new generation that will find you its deep roots there 

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:45.049
 expresses how then by what end 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.789
 7 the revival of the turkey of the French culture is not expressed one speaks about 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:53.989
 more and more couples of artists
