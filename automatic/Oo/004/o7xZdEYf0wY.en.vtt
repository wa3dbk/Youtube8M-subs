00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.092
 Let me offer you some fun and faxed depression about money in politics in America 

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.522
 So drive every mama even though there was a lot of donors 

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.041
 Uh ... Actually it was more than two-thirds of the 8 8 percent money 

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.741
 Comes from 

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.882
 David Rooney naturally has 82 percent of the money coming from Big 

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:20.642
 Donors 

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.232
 Of the surprises that low on me 

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.212
 Uh ... so in fact 

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:28.331
 Making any bomb is that they are more loyal to the major donors that it is a small donor 

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.152
 a path 

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:30.252
 In fact it is 

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:33.242
 Above the point three percent of Americans donated hundreds of dollars or more to 

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:34.401
 Candidates 

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.652
 Effects this year 

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.201
 So that it constitutes a very small percentage of us 

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.492
 But in fact they care about 

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:43.532
 But it is actually smaller than that to look at if given 200 

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:46.862
 It was bucks for four hundred dollars I thought it would bomb in related to white 

00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:50.762
 The beating house will work George W. w_ has used part of his task force 

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:53.092
 Dick Cheney's rent course does not 

00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:56.742
 But they could not and who had a cube more than ten thousand dollars 

00:00:56.742 --> 00:01:00.412
 So what percentage of Americans here are more than ten thousand 

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:02.512
 Or one percent 

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:05.342
 So in fact we are not talking about one percent 

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.652
 Where you can talk about one percent point 

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:09.742
 The men who run this country actually though 

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.342
 Point or per cent ratio 

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:14.452
 And it could be among the biggest one percent 1 richer ya but if you do not 

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:18.292
 Give money to politicians that you do not get the Bible 

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:22.932
 Those that actually buy our politicians do not indicate any one percent 

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.062
 And identify their loss of advantage 

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.042
 So if they were 

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.412
 The speed of the properties that the elbows in the four thousand had had what was called 

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:36.132
 I am amused by the American disposition of creating jobs that there is no such thing as several law 

00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:36.851
 Passed 

00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:40.612
 Not many of these companies do not employ people u_s_a_ fire 

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:43.222
 It was about creating jobs as they lining their pockets 

00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:46.222
 I pressed so well and spent a great deal of money to do it 

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:47.022
 It was in fact 

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.282
 To return their money here again in u_s_ that the money abroad want 

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:52.322
 Bring you back here but 

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.992
 Tax payment is paid very little 35 percent 

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:58.512
 They want to pay in part of the ball about five percent 

00:01:58.512 --> 00:01:59.782
 And they got their way 

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:04.142
 You know what rate of return they got on the money they invested in politicians 

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:05.682
 22 

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.222
 Thousand percent 

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:09.012
 Rate of Return 

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:13.561
 Jie I wonder why businesses and large businesses want by politicians 

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.501
 Invasion is immediately NAFTA 

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.841
 We allow bribery certified here in the USA 

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.192
 And tell you he sucker not to participate now 

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:22.991
 But the former bribery is 

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.531
 Now I'm just a donation campaign and not just lobbyists but hey if you have 

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:27.621
 Correctional Officer 

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:29.921
 Or you are actually a member of the Senate in Congress 

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.662
 Wait until you get out of office 

00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:33.251
 And how can we Greece Europe 

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.901
 In fact over the past ten years we know the numbers of two thousand 

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.651
 1-20 eleven 5,400 Congressional personnel close 

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.231
 To four hundred members 

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.781
 Left DC Accreditation Bay 

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.381
 The men who confessed 

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.051
 Not like Newt Gingrich who says he is a historical adviser to companies well 

00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.621
 please 

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:58.081
 So that a large number of 400 members of the house and attitude 

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.531
 There are only 535 members now of course number ten years 

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:05.341
 As the number of hundreds more before to give me a point of view 

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:06.141
 Is endchar 

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:09.421
 And the trunk of these people 

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.232
 What prompted the increase 

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.912
 That these people when you get 

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:15.142
 Members of the actual Congress left the senators 

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:17.381
 To become lobbyists 

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.191
 They pay a bend of one percent to 452,000 

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.011
 Finance Department 

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.081
 She's ever wondering why they're doing 

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.551
 Exactly what a great trade tells them to do 

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.571
 Because this is how you get this setup in their financing election 

00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:33.422
 elections 

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.121
 This is how you get paid 

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:37.731
 Office was saying leave 

00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:40.481
 In the rest of the world may not be fully aware 

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.741
 Americans are aware 

00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:44.361
 In fact when asked 

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:46.191
 And what is your highest 

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:49.261
 Top priorities work in the country 

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.891
 In this election the 

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.732
 Jobs came in number one but behind 

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:57.762
 Issued that no one is talking about any of the media in this asked about 

00:03:57.762 --> 00:04:00.262
 No one round elections on their stories 

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:03.582
 Of course all parties and candidates should not both discuss 

00:04:03.582 --> 00:04:04.962
 Second place overall 

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:06.911
 It was corruption 

00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.482
 87 percent of the country 

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:15.021
 The unprecedented seven percent dilution of a large number would say that the impact of money 

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.461
 We have Paul 

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:18.431
 At least from corruption 

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:22.351
 So we know here in the US we may not know every detail that 

00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:25.731
 I just gave you but we know almost as we see every day they take 

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.041
 Money from lobbies 

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.002
 They do exactly what lobbyists 

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.522
 Request to do when you do not give up what we believe 

00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:32.702
 Ballot boxes 

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:34.182
 We and how to vote 

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.682
 Is ignored immediately after the election ballot in the world may not know 

00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:38.272
 that 

00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:39.942
 In my come as a surprise to them 

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:41.092
 That in America 

00:04:41.092 --> 00:04:43.881
 This is done on a professional level 

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:47.071
 It's not something that's hidden and you're a little right 

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:51.082
 You can give me a little money in an envelope in a way that we do not 

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.631
 That you are legitimizing 

00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.941
 We have institutionalized the methodology 

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.132
 So they took on the whole 

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:00.132
 The body of politics in America 

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:03.902
 This is how it works and this is how the American people get screwed this way 

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:05.791
 We have lost our democracy 

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.851
 You know what I think the idea I have is we need to get a constitutional amendment 

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:13.501
 To fix these for money away from politics so that big business can not spend are 

00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:14.752
 Money is limited 

00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:16.342
 Corruption of our politicians 

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:20.712
 Do the patronage capitalism so that we can finance the election publicly so 

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:22.662
 Work for all our politicians 

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:24.102
 As well as donors 

00:05:24.102 --> 00:05:26.962
 Core Dash Pack dot com 

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:29.701
 The site we created is trying to respond 

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:33.501
 We will join us in that battle that is the number one issue in America
