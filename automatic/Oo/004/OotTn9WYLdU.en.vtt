something along the lines of well it's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
something along the lines of well it's
about<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.180> happen<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.930> society<00:00:55.710> if

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
about what would happen to society if

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
about what would happen to society if
all<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> grass<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.050> die<00:00:59.149> thus<00:01:00.149> confirming

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
all the grass was to die thus confirming

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
all the grass was to die thus confirming
our<00:01:01.469> suspicions<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.059> book<00:01:03.239> might<00:01:03.449> have

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
our suspicions that the book might have

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
our suspicions that the book might have
something<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.339> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> death<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.880> grass

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
something to do with the death of grass

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
something to do with the death of grass
so<00:01:06.900> what's<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.640> might

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so what's it about well I think I might

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
so what's it about well I think I might
have<00:01:08.790> already<00:01:08.970> covered<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
have already covered that but it is so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
have already covered that but it is so
much<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.430> than<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.000> published<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> mid

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
much more than that published in the mid

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
much more than that published in the mid
50's<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.130> book<00:01:14.310> begins<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> new<00:01:15.390> virus

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
