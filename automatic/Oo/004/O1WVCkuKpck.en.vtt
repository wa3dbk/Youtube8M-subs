00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.600
 brillux creative execution technique 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.730
 Viewed concrete optics in the design of 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.119
 The purist character is the interior of the house 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.589
 but increasingly in demand for concrete surfaces 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.689
 not in every apartment as a loft 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:24.909
 is designed to be more real 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 view concrete detail creative sentimento 78 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.189
 emits sight concrete very authentically 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.559
 In this video we show the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 execution of the visible optics as 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 accentuated variant with joints 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 classification 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 fill the first decoration as a base 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.989
 done on the smooth prepared 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.540
 background for this creative sentimento 78 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 in simple grain strength evenly 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.280
 apply and smooth 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.650
 for a rational work progress 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.000
 this is done in partitions vertically 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.040
 worked toothed 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.960
 with this technique is also the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.660
 Processing by only one processor 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.759
 possible after an exhaust time of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.100
 The area needs about 30 minutes 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 to be smoothed again by last burrs 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 to remove 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.880
 the surfaces division as concrete slabs 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:47.409
 done with line tape sentimento wear 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.950
 we went double in that way 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.170
 grain stronger in the fresh 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.899
 even layering becomes one 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 foil inserted with the metallic effect 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.569
 cellar pressed and directly again 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.569
 withdrawn 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.179
 The line band can now be removed 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 after a running time of around 30 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:24.940
 minutes you will also wet foggy 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:27.280
 Surface carefully smoothed pit 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 concrete outbreaks we imitate with the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.920
 metal eco effect know by strong 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.799
 press 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.160
 pull off jerky and immediately after 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.160
 smooth 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.170
 after another exhaust time of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.240
 The area will be about 30 minutes 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.190
 complete pressed around the silica 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.190
 highlighting tables of natural mica 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.280
 surfaces modern and innovative 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.670
 create with creative sentimento 78 of 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.670
 Brillux
