00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
what the 3000 is more than enough I'm

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.630 
what the 3000 is more than enough I'm
gonna<00:02:36.720> start<00:02:36.989> showing<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.500> how<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.010> do<00:02:38.340> each

each one and I'm going to start with the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.910 
each one and I'm going to start with the
50<00:02:42.000> because<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> fifth<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.140> gonna<00:02:43.320> cut<00:02:43.709> all

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
50 because the fifth is gonna cut all

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.250 
50 because the fifth is gonna cut all
the<00:02:44.220> roughness<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.239> then<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.900> going<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.110> go

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the roughness and then it's going to go

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.539 
the roughness and then it's going to go
with<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.620> handle<00:02:46.950> which<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
with your handle which is going to

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.330 
with your handle which is going to
create<00:02:47.880> less<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.930> less<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> wrap<00:02:50.010> until

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
create less and less of the wrap until

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.259 
create less and less of the wrap until
by<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.360> time<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.660> finished<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> 3000<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
by the time I finished with a 3000 the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.289 
by the time I finished with a 3000 the
3000<00:02:55.049> over<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
3000 over here this one is going to

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.110 
3000 over here this one is going to
create<00:02:57.810> almost<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.320> smooth<00:02:58.709> finish<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.519> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
create almost a smooth finish like the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.590 
create almost a smooth finish like the
top<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.040> end<00:03:02.070> all<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.459> need<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.940> maybe<00:03:03.239> is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
top in the end all I need to do maybe is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.199 
top in the end all I need to do maybe is
just<00:03:04.079> put<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> little<00:03:04.500> sailor<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.000> what

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
just put a little sailor and this what

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.520 
just put a little sailor and this what
you<00:03:06.360> need<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> do<00:03:08.269> let<00:03:09.269> me<00:03:09.360> start<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
you need to do let me start with with a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.640 
you need to do let me start with with a
50<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:14.070> order<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.489> attach<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.650> to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
50 to do that in order to attach the to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.470 
50 to do that in order to attach the to
attach<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.280> 15<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.650> need<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.799> use<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.340> one<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
attach the 15 I need to use this one and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.220 
attach the 15 I need to use this one and
the<00:03:22.200> cons<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> 3/4<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.570> goes<00:03:24.750> right

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the cons is like a 3/4 and it goes right

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.100 
the cons is like a 3/4 and it goes right
in<00:03:25.440> here

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.819 

miss<00:03:37.110> Cruz<00:03:37.409> later<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:39.620> n-type<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
miss Cruz later and it is n-type is

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.250 
miss Cruz later and it is n-type is
enough<00:03:41.099> because<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.269> put<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.049> one

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
enough because you you can put this one

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.830 
enough because you you can put this one
right<00:03:43.379> here<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.709> make<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.189> time<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.480> I

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
right here to make it time and then I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.830 
right here to make it time and then I
look<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.890> 50<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.939> the<00:03:48.060> 50<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
look for the 50 and this is the 50 and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.309 
look for the 50 and this is the 50 and
it<00:03:48.989> goes<00:03:49.170> try<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.890> make<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.340> as<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:51.110> center<00:03:52.110> as

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
it goes try to make it as a center as

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.470 
it goes try to make it as a center as
possible<00:03:52.980> otherwise<00:03:53.129> it's<00:03:53.579> going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.790> bubble

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
possible otherwise it's going to bubble

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.699 
possible otherwise it's going to bubble
a<00:03:54.690> lot<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.220> needs<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.760> go<00:03:57.629> really<00:03:58.500> really

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
a lot and it needs to go really really

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:10.960 
a lot and it needs to go really really
nice<00:03:59.099> and<00:03:59.400> Center<00:04:07.310> try<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> use<00:04:09.140> sunglasses<00:04:10.140> or

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
nice and Center try to use sunglasses or

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.789 
nice and Center try to use sunglasses or
or<00:04:11.970> something<00:04:12.510> for<00:04:12.690> safety<00:04:13.170> because<00:04:13.290> this

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
or something for safety because this

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.410 
or something for safety because this
thing<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.220> jump<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.730> lot<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.150> little<00:04:15.389> things

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
thing can jump a lot of little things

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:58.920 
thing can jump a lot of little things
into<00:04:16.049> your<00:04:16.169> eyes

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.520

okay like I let me show you here it is

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.170 
okay like I let me show you here it is
this<00:05:03.920> mode<00:05:04.250> now<00:05:04.750> not<00:05:05.750> shiny<00:05:06.200> like<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:07.520> top<00:05:07.940> of

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
this mode now not shiny like the top of

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.330 
this mode now not shiny like the top of
the<00:05:08.330> granite<00:05:09.460> it's<00:05:10.460> not<00:05:10.640> is<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:12.200> it's<00:05:13.160> not

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
the granite it's not is it it's not

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.920 
the granite it's not is it it's not
rough<00:05:13.610> anymore

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
rough anymore

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.710 
rough anymore
and<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.410> can<00:05:15.620> see<00:05:16.010> it<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:17.060> rounded<00:05:17.510> up<00:05:17.570> the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
and you can see it and I rounded up the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.260 
and you can see it and I rounded up the
edges<00:05:18.380> on<00:05:19.040> top<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.610> also<00:05:19.820> on<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.150> bottom

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
edges on top and also on the bottom

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.570 
edges on top and also on the bottom
because<00:05:21.110> we<00:05:21.350> don't<00:05:21.500> want<00:05:21.650> any<00:05:21.890> chart<00:05:23.050> ages<00:05:24.050> and

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
because we don't want any chart ages and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.450 
because we don't want any chart ages and
and<00:05:25.580> but<00:05:26.450> it's<00:05:26.630> this<00:05:26.870> much<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.530> can<00:05:27.800> feel<00:05:28.310> it

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
and but it's this much I can feel it

and but it's this much I can feel it
there<00:05:28.610> is<00:05:28.730> this<00:05:28.880> mode<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.510> still<00:05:30.410> gonna<00:05:30.650> go<00:05:30.920> with

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
there is this mode I still gonna go with

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.280 
there is this mode I still gonna go with

and now we're doing 200 this is the

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.089 
and now we're doing 200 this is the
finish<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:12.669> we<00:06:12.789> get<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.180> with<00:06:13.330> 200<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.680> it's

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
finish that we get in with 200 and it's

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.820 
finish that we get in with 200 and it's
not<00:06:15.280> shiny<00:06:15.610> but<00:06:16.060> it's<00:06:16.270> very<00:06:16.539> very<00:06:16.960> smooth<00:06:17.500> I
