 the story of ricciardi marsico is suspended between the urban legend and 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.989
 contemporary history 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.350
 after the successes in vietnam is the integration of special bodies was in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.609
 saddle the highly decorated US Army commander has become 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.690
 author of several books, some autobiographical recalculated of pure fiction 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 5 limb some of its businesses 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.890
 often arousing the embarrassment of colleagues and superiors 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.240
 for the decade in the image of the US army painted by the 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.310
 its little dedicated to you 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.110
 a collaboration expertise software service more crazy to repeat band 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 away recently allowed to spend his businesses 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.010
 in a video of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 that mixes first third person with the purpose of proposing a lot of action 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.449
 testosteronica 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.430
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.100
 after having seen it several months ago, we have a dedicated event 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 finally confronted with the final version of the game 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.340
 good Mr. is a title that makes no secret of its conformation 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 US capitalist disease 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.930
 responsible for mixed mushrooms from North Korea 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.420
 which means that he never misses an opportunity to insult colorful minds during 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.520
 game sequences 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.060
 via frasette aventis 3 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 piquè peeps out after the killing 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 I missed you gentlemen 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.119
 this outlined the protagonist a truly dinosaur figure 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.479
 it's called the US government of big washington cocks 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.440
 and the bastard enemies with xp 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 it is the only law that respects and naturally with animation 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 the teeth that start the story are as trivial to call you as much 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.300
 unlikely in the performance 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.409
 share to not follow alone 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.329
 the usual game of nuclear missiles around different industrial areas of the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.610
 Korea 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.620
 trident lei is marked by a total linearity 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.780
 my endless sequel of party halls pd fierce enemies 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.229
 which is constantly reduced from point to album 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.449
 making scraps affected any curtain obstacle on the way 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.519
 unique variety and offer the possibility to face the greatest 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.769
 part of the stations 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.209
 choosing to keep an open profile or throw grenades 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.609
 shoot as much as possible and become abundantly against the enemy 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.759
 or by opting for you that I wait for you 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.019
 or slipping the shoulders of the unfortunate 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.909
 eliminate them with the push of a button and enjoy the takes ends the 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.289
 world with lots of acute bye bye bye corpses of enemies 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.049
 this formula based on the setting in the summer proposes the alternation of before 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.069
 and third person 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.779
 with the latter activated in the case you put on cover through the appropriate 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.019
 meal 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.650
 this mechanic already tested in other titles as a fun quantum of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.319
 last year's solace returns a whole fighting experience 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.739
 added fluid 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.439
 not to convince instead the reproduction of the weapons which fail to 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.329
 return an idea of ​​right weight, much less, or convincing recoil 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.429
 the design of the levels composed of euro noises offer good alternation between environments 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:14.589
 open and closed units not appreciable variety that player brings to visit 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.040
 industrial installations 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.099
 Morning gardens and even Victorian villas 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.660
 it is a pity that exploratory chansons are always only one way 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.800
 and there is no possibility of deviating from the path envisaged by the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.239
 developers 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.259
 Script usage is present 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.529
 but not massively and although some sequences demonstrate 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.180
 potential to engage 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.540
 the next technical department will ruin any possibility in this respect 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.879
 sense 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.469
 names that really good idea sometimes exploited me 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.650
 and that of being able to eliminate the lighting sources of the closed rooms 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.379
 through the silenced gun 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.269
 wear night vision goggles always available to all 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.499
 why proceed to eliminate the enemies hardly 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.689
 artificial intelligence that moves opponents has some routing 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.489
 discreet 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.749
 giving it, for example, the ability to take us out of the range of action 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.729
 grenades as soon as they are launched which alternates moments of darkness 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.529
 total in which completely short of ideas i'm a capitata run towards 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.949
 player shooting the city 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.669
 despite displaced behavior 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.830
 some Koreans have an excellent mine 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.269
 and also by addressing the intermediate level campaign of the three available 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.329
 we needed facebook 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.699
 use of the cover 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.409
 vital energy says it is indeed small and as far as fit is concerned 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:24.620
 regenerative 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.360
 one two continents and states may be sufficient to lead to 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.069
 loading 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.219
 intimate there is photo 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.300
 the single player campaign has a long life span to head 

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:38.039
 the 5 and 6 hours definitively conform to the scarce - also the offer the hearing of 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.930
 this title is able to arouse 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.210
 a small player is also present alongside the single player campaign 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.580
 multiplayer compartment 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.539
 which we will analyze in more detail 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.499
 in the dedicated article 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:53.059
 in design that characterizes the imitations of characters I pull out now go 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.460
 rather scholastic surrealism without personality 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.920
 therefore, the entire artistic sector is unable to hit 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.080
 sorry to note how from a technical point of view the title presents a 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 collection of pots of impressive graphic inaccuracies 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.720
 price remained excess definition to choose polygonal penetration 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.220
 pop-up absence of losses to Mr. 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.860
 and if this were not enough a fluid compromise, their explicable lack of 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.439
 code optimization 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.539
 which will have 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.589
 even on recent machines with no exaggerated resolutions 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.569
 in this sea of ​​mediocrity it is almost a surprise to find music 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.300
 discreet billed originals 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.319
 dubbing in English not bad 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.360
 wallpapers that you like minded by miki rurc 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.289
 it is a pity in this sense that the Italian version of the game presents a 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.289
 work of decidedly inferior quality voices 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.490
 conficio a very troubled development off interesting shooter route 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.220
 cooperative 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.210
 third person 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.360
 over the years it has become a mediocre product under every point 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.629
 of view 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.839
 in dubio charisma of the character and completely wasted barale game station 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.800
 and for an exciting technique the bad 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.229
 I fly a great deal of shooters of a very different quality now present on the 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:05:59.930
 market 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.889
 there really is no reason to dwell on this title 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.690
 unless you are a huge fan of the buddy massacre protagonist 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.029
 on feisbuc 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.589
 only a budget price could have saved the fate of this born project 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.479
 under a bad star but the business machine unfortunately allowed nothing 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.130
 quirked fully redistributed at the dawn of 2010 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.610
 promote was simply a title to avoid 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.830
 regardless of vips picked up personal opinions
