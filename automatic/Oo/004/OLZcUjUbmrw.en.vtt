00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.290
 is cool to look for fresh tomato 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.490
 expert in this special for these high 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.589
 but regardless of where you can do 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.419
 also with rich round 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.849
 thank you cala gració for taking care of me 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:21.130
 We wanted to peel the tomato before 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:23.779
 the session to cross as in the most 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.060
 sad in boiling water for 30 seconds 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 you take it out and peel it alone time to put it 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.509
 in cold water so that the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.950
 cooking to take out the ashes and what 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.500
 illicit covers of tomato concassé in 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.440
 coffee the tomato concassé let's make 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.780
 this sauce that I love with butter 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.680
 a good spoonful of butter and a little 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.640
 of olive oil 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.250
 I really like the taste of tomato with 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.219
 butter if you never tried it, it is 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.440
 a good time because there are rich tomatoes 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.750
 butter and olive oil a little 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.899
 of garlic I have why we're going to 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.899
 smash 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.940
 deferred 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 but that perfumes this perfume and the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.420
 home is also good you took the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.210
 was the thyme you do and here 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.360
 let's go with the tomatillo 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 in butter the tomato takes a flavor is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.049
 very very weird 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.789
 and this is cooked in five minutes 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.130
 I'm going to put salt I'm going to put pepper 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.189
 and the sauce will be for our 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 easy and delicious homemade labor seas 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.509
 increasing by auto is not a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 sauce person is something fast it's only in 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 five minutes exactly is the idea already 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.990
 I find it very delicate and the tomato 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.569
 it has to stay like this saying does not 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 I've done a bit of an apparition 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.920
 exactly this is the idea with this 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 thermal shock is supposedly going to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.689
 acidity to the tomato well that is to say that all 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 that if the taste of the butter that the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.899
 taste of the disgust of the salt of the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.899
 pepper and nuances 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.110
 is taking out that you are fishing from 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.030
 water while we finish for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.100
 let it be warm and serve it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.580
 so that we go in your house you can 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.580
 enjoy it
