Holy Grail eye primer this hat works

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.090 
Holy Grail eye primer this hat works
phenomenally<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:07.510> tried<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.170> lot<00:03:08.950> of

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
phenomenally I have tried a lot of

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.790 
phenomenally I have tried a lot of
partners<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> only<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.410> works

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
partners this is the only one that works

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.620 
partners this is the only one that works
it<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> little<00:03:12.430> bit<00:03:12.580> more<00:03:12.700> sticky<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.240> nature

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
it is a little bit more sticky in nature

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.020 
it is a little bit more sticky in nature
so<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.080> helps<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.040> products<00:03:15.430> adhere

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
so it really helps the products adhere

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.780 
so it really helps the products adhere
but<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.110> is<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> Kat<00:03:17.560> Von<00:03:17.590> D<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.640> high

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
but it is the Kat Von D this is the high

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.300 
but it is the Kat Von D this is the high
voltage<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.360> primer<00:03:19.810> love<00:03:20.620> love<00:03:20.860> love<00:03:21.130> this

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
voltage I primer love love love this

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.730 
voltage I primer love love love this
stuff<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.510> more<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.080> concealer

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
stuff so it is more of like a concealer

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.940 
stuff so it is more of like a concealer
type<00:03:27.010> consistency<00:03:27.700> if<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.210> will<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.650> has<00:03:29.800> that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
type consistency if you will it has that

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.710 
type consistency if you will it has that
color<00:03:30.190> anyway<00:03:31.020> so<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.970> does<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.390> take

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
color anyway so and it does not take

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560 
color anyway so and it does not take
much<00:03:35.080> with<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.100> here<00:03:36.610> will<00:03:37.420> do

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
much with this like this here will do

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.760 
much with this like this here will do
both<00:03:37.750> my<00:03:37.930> eyes<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:41.170> always<00:03:41.500> make<00:03:41.740> sure

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.710 

you<00:03:52.280> guys<00:03:52.430> probably<00:03:52.700> just<00:03:53.000> see<00:03:53.120> my<00:03:53.240> cat<00:03:53.480> jump
