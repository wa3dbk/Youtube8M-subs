now<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.150> size<00:01:15.570> jar<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.200> started

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
now this is the size jar I started

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.760 
now this is the size jar I started
dollars<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.700> online<00:01:18.770> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
dollars but I think if you go online to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
dollars but I think if you go online to
kinky<00:01:20.040> curly<00:01:20.369> icon<00:01:20.909> um<00:01:22.700> they<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> smaller

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
kinky curly icon um they have a smaller

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
kinky curly icon um they have a smaller
size<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.400> worth<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
size but I would say that it's worth it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.960 
size but I would say that it's worth it
because<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.049> didn't<00:01:28.560> define<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.130> curls<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
because it didn't define my curls you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
because it didn't define my curls you
can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.860> did<00:01:32.189> define<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.670> curls<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:33.329> root

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
can see it did define my curls from root

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
can see it did define my curls from root
to<00:01:34.500> tip<00:01:35.030> um<00:01:36.799> my<00:01:37.799> ends<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.490> bit

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to tip um my ends are a little bit

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
to tip um my ends are a little bit
straighter<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> perm

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
straighter because that's where the perm

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.270 
straighter because that's where the perm
is<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.869> curly<00:01:42.869> wavy

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
is but where it's like really curly wavy

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
is but where it's like really curly wavy
that's<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.119> new<00:01:45.299> growth<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.350> don't

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that's like on my new growth so I don't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
that's like on my new growth so I don't
have<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.790> much<00:01:48.799> more<00:01:49.799> hair<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.579> let<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.659> out

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
have that much more hair to let go out

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.580 
have that much more hair to let go out
and<00:01:52.189> cut<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.799> natural<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
and cut off to be all natural but I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.280 
and cut off to be all natural but I
would<00:01:58.590> definitely<00:01:58.710> recommend<00:01:59.210> getting<00:02:00.290> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
as a part of the hair system because it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.530 
as a part of the hair system because it
really<00:02:03.180> did<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.450> work<00:02:04.130> for<00:02:05.130> me<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> do

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
investment i'm really glad i found this
because<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.510> been<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.110> hard<00:03:07.709> finding<00:03:07.980> some

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
because it's been so hard finding some

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
because it's been so hard finding some
stuff<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.549> will<00:03:08.819> actually<00:03:09.000> work<00:03:09.299> with<00:03:09.890> my

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
stuff that will actually work with my

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.220 
stuff that will actually work with my
type<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> hair<00:03:11.819> through<00:03:12.630> my<00:03:12.900> transition

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
type of hair through my transition

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990 
type of hair through my transition
because<00:03:13.650> i<00:03:13.860> don't<00:03:14.069> want<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.340> cut<00:03:14.459> off<00:03:14.579> my<00:03:14.609> hair

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
I don't like short hair on me so that's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.710

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
wearing weaves because for one it's
