curl so i do also have a couple cons for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
curl so i do also have a couple cons for
the<00:00:35.040> item<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> labeling<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the item which is that the labeling is a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
the item which is that the labeling is a
little<00:00:37.980> unclear<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.149> say<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> heat

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
little unclear or like say the heat

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
little unclear or like say the heat
settings<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.800> type<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> curl<00:00:41.250> pattern

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
settings and what type of curl pattern

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940 
settings and what type of curl pattern
you<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.989> sucks<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you want it sucks as you kind of have to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
you want it sucks as you kind of have to
refer<00:00:44.399> back<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.969> manual<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.840> what

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
refer back to the manual to know what

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
refer back to the manual to know what
you're<00:00:46.170> actually<00:00:46.379> setting<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.050> marker<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you're actually setting the marker on I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
you're actually setting the marker on I
guess<00:00:49.739> um<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> gets<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.629> confusing

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
guess um so that gets a little confusing

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.160 
guess um so that gets a little confusing
after<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> while<00:00:52.739> also<00:00:53.280> after<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.420> while<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.899> does

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
after a while also after a while it does

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.270 
after a while also after a while it does
get<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.530> heavy<00:00:56.390> um<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.680> think<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> last

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
get pretty heavy um and I think the last

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.619 
get pretty heavy um and I think the last
comment<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:02.239> bottom<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
comment I have is that the bottom of the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
comment I have is that the bottom of the
tool<00:01:03.870> isn't<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.589> sturdy<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> set

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
tool isn't that sturdy so when you set

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
tool isn't that sturdy so when you set
it<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.540> only<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.470> nub

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it down there's only like one little nub

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
it down there's only like one little nub
on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.970> bottom<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> tool<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
on the bottom of the tool that kind of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
on the bottom of the tool that kind of
helps<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> keep<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> sturdy<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.780> stable<00:01:13.290> when

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
helps you keep it sturdy or stable when

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
helps you keep it sturdy or stable when
you<00:01:13.770> set<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.250> down<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.790> I've<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.479> dropped

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you set it down so I've actually dropped

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
you set it down so I've actually dropped
it<00:01:16.110> twice<00:01:16.439> already<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.670> respondes<00:01:18.630> built

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it twice already but I respondes built

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
it twice already but I respondes built
pretty<00:01:19.080> strong<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.890> still<00:01:20.130> works

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pretty strong because it still works

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.289
