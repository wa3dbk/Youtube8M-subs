you for a moment about how insulation
works<00:00:13.250> first<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.940> three<00:00:15.150> basic<00:00:15.330> types

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

radiant<00:01:13.170> heat<00:01:13.380> flow<00:01:13.650> accounts<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
radiant heat flow accounts for the
