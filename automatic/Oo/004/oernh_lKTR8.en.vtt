 why I hope this video I'm going 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.760
 tell you in a moment my store 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.530
 at christmas last I was at the olympia for 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.290
 go see a show with my dad 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.780
 is wise ride I saw a homeless 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.340
 on the side and I do not know I got 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.630
 felt called by the homeless but I do not 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.970
 did not know exactly what to do 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.030
 I have a superhuman custom after 200 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.280
 meters pretty much of peace it's 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.250
 really got stronger I told my 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.720
 father listens walloon a piia reserved the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.840
 I have to go and see the people without 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.220
 shelter and suddenly I went to see him I 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.530
 do not know why I told myself 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.640
 that you give money 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.870
 so I opened my wallet 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 I took 10 euros and gave him 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.540
 it's different and by giving him his 10 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.540
 she grabbed my hand 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.730
 abruptly he kissed my hand 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.590
 even woke up his wife who slept there 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.350
 I felt why I understood 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.180
 why I went to see him 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.590
 it's just for that moment and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.299
 yet it was just ten heroes do you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.010
 do not even know how much I'm lying 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.019
 the age to share gratitude 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.090
 at the same time he expresses his gratitude 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.130
 I was grateful to have 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.540
 listened to the pay I had at the bottom of 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.420
 me because I was already gone actually 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.610
 a year later I told myself that what 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.860
 I can do to continue this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.320
 gratitude that I had deep inside me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.670
 moment I shared with him and that's 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.769
 that's why I went to see people without 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.239
 shelter and gave them gifts and 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.489
 that 's the conclusion of this video 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.590
 it's all that I would like you 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.420
 to say it's not necessarily to go 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.790
 give money to homeless people but 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.299
 to listen to your heart to follow your 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 intuitions 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.350
 So I would like to wish you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.560
 merry christmas and tell you furrows 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.590
 your heart and editions to very 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.590
