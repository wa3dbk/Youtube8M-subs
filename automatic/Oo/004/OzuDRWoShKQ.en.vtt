00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.230 

that's<00:02:33.320> not<00:02:33.470> bad<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.890> mean<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:34.670> fact<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
that's not bad I mean in fact I have to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.360 
that's not bad I mean in fact I have to
save<00:02:35.450> probably<00:02:36.110> my<00:02:36.290> first<00:02:36.500> homebrew<00:02:36.980> wasn't

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
save probably my first homebrew wasn't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.270 
save probably my first homebrew wasn't
yes<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.210> mean<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> little<00:02:38.810> bit<00:02:38.990> sweet<00:02:39.280> could

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
yes I mean it's a little bit sweet could

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.330 
yes I mean it's a little bit sweet could
use<00:02:40.370> maybe<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.610> little<00:02:40.700> bit<00:02:40.880> more<00:02:41.000> carbonation

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
use maybe a little bit more carbonation

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.400 
use maybe a little bit more carbonation
if<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.970> case<00:02:44.210> let<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> beer<00:02:45.080> sit

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
if that's the case let the beer sit

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.780 
if that's the case let the beer sit
longer<00:02:46.070> than<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> week

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
longer than a week

the<00:02:47.120> longer<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.750> beer<00:02:47.990> sits<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.650> less<00:02:48.830> sweet

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the longer the beer sits the less sweet

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.580 
the longer the beer sits the less sweet
it<00:02:49.430> will<00:02:49.610> taste<00:02:49.850> you'll<00:02:50.840> figure<00:02:51.110> out<00:02:51.320> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
it will taste you'll figure out the

this former home brewer sold on mr. beer
there<00:02:58.940> are<00:02:59.060> different<00:02:59.390> levels<00:02:59.750> I<00:02:59.930> say<00:03:00.170> I'd<00:03:00.440> say

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
there are different levels I say I'd say

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.370 
there are different levels I say I'd say
this<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.070> very<00:03:01.340> basic<00:03:01.700> level<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:03.050> really

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
this is the very basic level but really

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.110 
this is the very basic level but really
couldn't<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.710> gotten<00:03:03.950> any<00:03:04.310> easier<00:03:04.910> than

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
couldn't have gotten any easier than

couldn't have gotten any easier than
that
