00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and out up and down one point of

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.610 
and out up and down one point of
articulation<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.800> elbow<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> can

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
articulation at the elbow and but it can

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.580 
articulation at the elbow and but it can
go<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.580> out<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.200> above<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> glove

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
go in and out there and above the glove

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.390 
go in and out there and above the glove
here<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.640> turned<00:02:48.020> but<00:02:49.020> nothing<00:02:49.500> at<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.800> wrist

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
here can turned but nothing at the wrist

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.270 
here can turned but nothing at the wrist
area<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.480> hand<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.870> open<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.010> probably

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
area and the hand is open so probably

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.900 
area and the hand is open so probably
meant<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.550> hold<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.150> pumpkin<00:02:54.510> bottom<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:54.900> it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
meant to hold the pumpkin bottom with it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.050 
meant to hold the pumpkin bottom with it
nothing<00:02:56.910> here<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.450> nothing<00:02:58.220> at<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.820> waist

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
nothing here and nothing at the waist

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.220 
nothing here and nothing at the waist
either<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.840> torso<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.530> nothing<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:03.180> hips<00:03:03.959> got

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
either so torso is nothing but hips got

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.320 
either so torso is nothing but hips got
full<00:03:04.500> joints<00:03:04.920> surprisingly<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.820> can<00:03:09.150> go

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
full joints surprisingly so it can go

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.610 
full joints surprisingly so it can go
easy<00:03:09.959> up<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.530> down<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.959> side<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.110> side<00:03:13.140> as

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
easy up and down and side to side as

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.420 
easy up and down and side to side as
well<00:03:13.830> as<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.700> upper<00:03:15.420> point<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.720> articulation

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
well as a upper point of articulation

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.040 
well as a upper point of articulation
right<00:03:17.430> above<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.350> thigh<00:03:20.600> then<00:03:21.600> knee

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
right above the thigh then knee

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.830 
right above the thigh then knee
articulation<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.950> pretty<00:03:23.190> interesting<00:03:23.840> stuff

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
articulation is pretty interesting stuff

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.920 
articulation is pretty interesting stuff
one<00:03:25.170> articulation<00:03:25.800> point<00:03:26.070> they<00:03:26.310> put<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.930> ball

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
one articulation point they put a ball

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.710 
one articulation point they put a ball
joint<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.700> out<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.510> can

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
joint so it's in and out and you can

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.300 
joint so it's in and out and you can
turn<00:03:31.020> it<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:33.830> but<00:03:34.830> that's<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
turn it like that and but that's it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.300 
turn it like that and but that's it
because<00:03:35.730> there's<00:03:35.940> nothing<00:03:36.420> above<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.050> boot

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
because there's nothing above the boot

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.710 
because there's nothing above the boot
which<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.489> kind<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.880> odd<00:03:39.030> because<00:03:39.209> they<00:03:39.450> put<00:03:39.630> it

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
which is kind of odd because they put it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.600 
which is kind of odd because they put it
above<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.050> glove<00:03:40.260> here<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:40.920> they<00:03:41.040> didn't<00:03:41.340> put

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
above the glove here but they didn't put

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.449 
above the glove here but they didn't put
it<00:03:41.700> above<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.090> boot<00:03:42.300> nothing<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it above the boot nothing there and

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.580 
it above the boot nothing there and
nothing<00:03:44.459> at<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> feet<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:46.170> he<00:03:46.260> does<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.560> a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
nothing at the feet and he does have a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.460 
nothing at the feet and he does have a
nice<00:03:46.769> hook<00:03:47.130> at<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> boot<00:03:47.670> end<00:03:48.320> simply<00:03:49.320> lift

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
nice hook at the boot end simply lift

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070 
nice hook at the boot end simply lift
the<00:03:49.530> right<00:03:49.739> leg<00:03:49.769> up<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.370> down<00:03:50.610> here<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:51.840> point

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the right leg up and down here one point

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.740 
the right leg up and down here one point
at<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> knee<00:03:52.650> but<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.040> can't<00:03:53.280> turn<00:03:53.489> it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
at the knee but you can't turn it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.380 
at the knee but you can't turn it
nothing<00:03:55.680> above<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> boot<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.850> nothing

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
nothing above the boot here and nothing

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.200 
nothing above the boot here and nothing
at<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.410> feed<00:03:58.680> area<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.550> that's<00:03:59.820> it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
at the feed area so that's it

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.440 
at the feed area so that's it
particulate<00:04:00.810> wise<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.730> boot<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.270> little

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
particulate wise and the boot a little

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.560 
particulate wise and the boot a little
pointy<00:04:04.110> there<00:04:04.370> but<00:04:05.370> by<00:04:05.580> using<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:06.060> neat<00:04:06.330> cut

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
pointy there but by using that neat cut

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.690 
pointy there but by using that neat cut
you<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.960> just<00:04:07.680> turn<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.980> whole<00:04:08.130> bottom<00:04:08.460> foot

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you can just turn the whole bottom foot

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.199 
you can just turn the whole bottom foot
that<00:04:09.600> way<00:04:10.700> overall<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.910> think<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:14.209> Hobgoblin

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
that way overall I think this Hobgoblin

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.180 
that way overall I think this Hobgoblin
version<00:04:15.720> I'm<00:04:16.200> surprised<00:04:16.620> they<00:04:16.769> went<00:04:17.010> with

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
version I'm surprised they went with

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.539 
version I'm surprised they went with
this<00:04:17.340> early<00:04:17.730> 90s<00:04:18.209> look<00:04:18.450> at<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.570> character<00:04:19.549> it's

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
this early 90s look at a character it's

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.099 
this early 90s look at a character it's
an<00:04:20.790> average<00:04:21.060> figure<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.600> thought<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.959> could<00:04:22.079> be

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
an average figure I thought it could be

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.520 
an average figure I thought it could be
better<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:24.240> okay<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.780> could<00:04:24.870> find<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.320> at

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
better it's okay if you could find it at

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.520 
better it's okay if you could find it at
retail<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.419> wouldn't<00:04:27.840> pay<00:04:28.020> too<00:04:28.080> much<00:04:28.290> for

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
retail but I wouldn't pay too much for

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.460 
retail but I wouldn't pay too much for
it<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:30.000> secondary<00:04:30.419> market<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.230> can't

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
it on the secondary market if you can't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.090 
it on the secondary market if you can't
find<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.940> it's<00:04:33.090> pretty<00:04:33.180> common<00:04:33.540> enough<00:04:34.100> in

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
find it but it's pretty common enough in

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.680 
find it but it's pretty common enough in
the<00:04:35.280> stores<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:36.060> should<00:04:36.270> probably<00:04:36.480> be

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
the stores that you should probably be

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.490 
the stores that you should probably be
able<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> find<00:04:37.169> it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
able to find it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.940 
able to find it
so<00:04:38.130> that's<00:04:38.850> review<00:04:39.320> thanks<00:04:40.320> for<00:04:40.440> watching<00:04:40.740> and
