00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
now we're going to go inside scene and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.720 
now we're going to go inside scene and
it's<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> try<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.070> update<00:02:38.070> again

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it's going to try and update again

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.729 
it's going to try and update again
because<00:02:39.120> we've<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.660> sat<00:02:39.870> altered<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> files

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:59.350 

okay<00:03:40.220> we're<00:03:40.819> just<00:03:40.940> gonna<00:03:41.060> let<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.300> finish

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.710 

only<00:04:00.360> don't<00:04:00.480> know<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:02.060> won<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.300> hansel

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
only don't know I won it like hansel

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.350 
only don't know I won it like hansel
doubt<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.020> first<00:04:04.380> time<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.590> was<00:04:05.360> Australian

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
doubt the first time that was Australian

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.300 
doubt the first time that was Australian
to<00:04:06.450> block<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.780> from<00:04:06.810> updating<00:04:07.290> which<00:04:08.099> was

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to block it from updating which was

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.010 
to block it from updating which was
successful<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.180> how<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.450> goes<00:04:09.569> back<00:04:09.810> and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
successful and how it goes back and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.199 
successful and how it goes back and
updates<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.560> different<00:04:10.830> file<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.849> aboard<00:04:12.090> to

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
updates a different file is it aboard to

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.319 
updates a different file is it aboard to
that<00:04:12.330> one<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.840> doesn't<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.200> again<00:04:17.329> so

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that one and it doesn't do it again so

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.729 
that one and it doesn't do it again so
basically<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:18.840> kind<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.079> local<00:04:19.380> patch<00:04:19.530> is

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
basically it's kind of local patch is

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
basically it's kind of local patch is
not<00:04:19.919> an<00:04:20.010> online<00:04:20.340> one<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:20.760> he<00:04:20.940> bowled<00:04:21.269> see<00:04:21.480> you
