a<00:01:51.450> classic<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.040> first<00:01:53.369> game<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
a classic and it is my first game that I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
me I think it would be so awesome if
they<00:01:58.560> remade<00:01:59.100> ocarina<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> time<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.240> better

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
