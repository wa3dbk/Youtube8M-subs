00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.450
 hi guys once again that josé calixto 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.559
 your therapist and skateboard teacher 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.660
 online 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.900
 today to you how to ride a skateboard 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.180
 ideal for street questions with 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.290
 relation to the size of shape size of 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.200
 wheel tricks very well to many people me 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.600
 question which chip ideal for street 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.790
 How big is the shape of the president? 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.010
 Incarnate life asks 8.0 that you are not the 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.000
 that we have today is not only a work 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.660
 of Sun 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.449
 people confuse sad as 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.539
 accessory flip the flip that flip and it is not 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.269
 face and system boardslide has gap in 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.969
 transitions then a street championship 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.489
 will roll of everything not only maneuver of soil 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.679
 and if you take the boy too much son to 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.350
 Not unless you're a child, right? 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:00.249
 You're still small there, yes you can. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 catch a thinner arrives 7.5 7.7 some 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.170
 thing so I'll use these wheels 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.560
 It's the first time I'm going to ride the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.369
 skate country critical small skate wheels 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.640
 lighter 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.439
 the wheel certainly another in another ranking 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.159
 that is to say for all types of 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.320
 for example, this wheel here 95 a 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.680
 if you are in doubt about the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.649
 hardness of the wheels you will use 95 to 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.899
 it is neither too hard nor too soft 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.119
 The wheel is too hard. 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.109
 is an ideal route for ground tracks 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.909
 leasing 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.850
 She's going to run wild on the ground. 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.219
 so now on the asphalt where most 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.469
 walk a wheel too hard will be half 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.369
 it 's difficult to walk, it's going to tremble 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.009
 enough 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.429
 if you walk in a very assault to be a 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.090
 softer wheel than this 95 would be the 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.039
 ideal 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.490
 with respect to the wheel size of wheel 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.740
 smaller ones are lighter when the larger 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.140
 slide more personal , andré run 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.679
 but they are heavier 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.780
 I'll use the trick of the 146 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.770
 millimeters you 're staying far more 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.599
 lightweight than the others I 've used 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.959
 bolts she mind the bearing I go 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.210
 use this roller bearing and 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.770
 berlin 7 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'll use this top sandpaper mount 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 may seem like a problem for 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.820
 some people but it has no secret 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 you do not miss you take 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:39.060
 What a logic to take this paper 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.340
 that I'm not underestimating you anymore 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.190
 the human being is complex 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.690
 we have differences intelligence lines 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.000
 so explain everything right 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.100
 safe here at the tip of the thumb tip of the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.960
 indicator and thumb on both sides 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.220
 these fingers here you will not hold 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:08.790
 I have disgust and look here the distance of 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:10.080
 here and only tone I do I press 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.720
 here in front 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.470
 in the middle until you get there 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.020
 too much 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:27.290
 What I do now I'm learning 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:27.290
 here watch your leg 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.870
 It had long since I wore pink are 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.870
 small 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:01.350
 ready my new skateboard is mounted 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:05.140
 shape 8.0 wheel 50mm 95 hardness 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.910
 146mm truck 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.200
 you can see that the trick is fine 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.200
 aligned with arrives 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:27.310
 and snake clear jega sat series smiling 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:31.860
 arrived a new lift up to 12 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.320
 cases, I can not wait to meet you. 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.090
 and continue that conversation 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.090
 who should not not use 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.910
 so this is it I'm going to stay here 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.730
 A big hug to you and see you next time. 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.460
 video tchan to measure sheik 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.920
 basically you make you stick 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.090
 mission in centimeters 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:09.360
 in this case, this chip has 20 points 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.360
 five centimeters what makes you 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.699
 1
