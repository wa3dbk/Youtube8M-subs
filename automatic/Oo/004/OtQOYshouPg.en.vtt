okay<00:00:03.300> free<00:00:03.570> stove<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:04.250> let's<00:00:05.250> start<00:00:05.549> first

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939 
okay free stove so let's start first

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay free stove so let's start first
exercise<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> free<00:00:07.290> stroke<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:07.799> in

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
exercise of the free stroke we're in

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.160 
exercise of the free stroke we're in
this<00:00:08.010> remember<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> perk<00:00:09.180> perpendicular

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
this remember the perk perpendicular

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.589 
this remember the perk perpendicular
stick<00:00:10.500> happens<00:00:11.009> like<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.519> perpendicular<00:00:12.299> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
stick happens like this perpendicular to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.310 
stick happens like this perpendicular to
the<00:00:12.750> ground

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the ground

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.580 
the ground
we're<00:00:14.009> gonna<00:00:14.129> throw<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.849> stick<00:00:15.120> down<00:00:15.440> let<00:00:16.440> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we're gonna throw the stick down let it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.940 
we're gonna throw the stick down let it
go<00:00:16.740> where<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> wants<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:18.390> let<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.290> hand<00:00:19.590> slide

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
go where it wants and let the hand slide

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.460 
go where it wants and let the hand slide
down<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.460> go<00:00:20.640> where<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.940> once<00:00:21.260> they're<00:00:22.260> going

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
down to go where it once they're going

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590 
down to go where it once they're going
to<00:00:22.620> opposite<00:00:23.040> directions<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:24.120> will

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
to opposite directions this will

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.590 
to opposite directions this will
reinforce<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.340> idea<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.850> full<00:00:27.120> rebound

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
reinforce the idea of the full rebound

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.980 
reinforce the idea of the full rebound
capability<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.350> drumstick<00:00:29.810> forearm<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
capability the drumstick forearm is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.150 
capability the drumstick forearm is
parallel<00:00:31.020> to<00:00:31.830> ground<00:00:32.070> steep<00:00:32.579> perpendicular

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
parallel to ground steep perpendicular

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
parallel to ground steep perpendicular
we<00:00:35.160> end<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> pad<00:00:36.059> level<00:00:36.510> sometimes<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
we end up at the pad level sometimes a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.849 
we end up at the pad level sometimes a
little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.289> below<00:00:38.839> okay<00:00:39.870> exercise<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
little bit below okay exercise for the

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:49.430 
little bit below okay exercise for the
free<00:00:41.129> stroke<00:00:46.789> okay<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.929> long<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.260> have

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
free stroke okay and as long as we have

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439 
free stroke okay and as long as we have
it<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.859> optimal<00:00:50.460> sort<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.030> place<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it at an optimal sort of place on the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
it at an optimal sort of place on the
stick<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:52.289> we're<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stick if we're back here there's a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
stick if we're back here there's a
little<00:00:53.370> resistance<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.300> thing<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.690> here

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
little resistance same thing up here

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.079 
little resistance same thing up here
we'll<00:00:55.620> find<00:00:55.859> a<00:00:55.949> spot<00:00:56.219> where<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.519> stick<00:00:56.819> wants

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
we'll find a spot where the stick wants

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.079 
we'll find a spot where the stick wants
to<00:00:57.239> rebound<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> most<00:01:01.129> okay<00:01:02.159> exercise<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
to rebound the most okay exercise for

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.140 
to rebound the most okay exercise for
the<00:01:03.149> free<00:01:03.420> stroke<00:01:03.830> now<00:01:04.830> full<00:01:05.460> stroke<00:01:05.820> free
