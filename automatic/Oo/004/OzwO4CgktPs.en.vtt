00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I'll tell you now how river is strong 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.410
 connect standard canarian 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 camera lens to out of it 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.670
 It turned out great mokrushnik first 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 turn at the disconnected lens is necessary 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 fix the diaphragm now see 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 aperture unplugged lenses open 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.500
 revenue is big enough if you 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.660
 will shoot with an open diaphragm 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.670
 then you will have a very depth of field 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 small and without micro flight you are unlikely 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.969
 something you can get good 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.030
 image because you don't manually 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 be able to withstand so high 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 accuracy is therefore necessary to put this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 lenses and aperture 8 like my 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.210
 experience of observation and the eight with him 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 time depth of field human 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.540
 the sharpness itself for the diffraction effect 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.770
 it does not fall that is 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 set the frag to less eights 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 we win nothing we lose only 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 depth of field 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 setting it higher sharpness well of course 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.409
 get the most depth of field more 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.720
 but now the sharpness we get quieter 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.259
 how to fix the shut off aperture 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.259
 lens 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 my battle 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:46.500
 canon 600d connect lens to it 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:49.850
 in the most usual way we install 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.370
 focal length of 18 millimeters 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.440
 We put some mode for 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.229
 aperture priority either 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:05.600
 mannol where I can set 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.600
 manually jump someone there is no setting and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:23.010
 we expose our diaphragm on an axis one 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:26.760
 eight have now become her 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.220
 fix you need to click here there 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.820
 button depth of field preview 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.820
 push it and hold it push 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.600
 the second button that allows 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:44.430
 cut the lens two buttons hold 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:48.239
 unscrew the lens all the aperture with us 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.880
 Now 8 hole diminished if you 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.130
 let's say you want to shoot super macro 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.150
 video then the aperture of the eight can be 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.360
 not enough and you will need will be 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.739
 set the aperture f16 is clear that there 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 diffraction will climb effects on video this 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.959
 practically not noticeable therefore 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.850
 and the depth of field will be greater therefore 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.000
 gain from more depth of field 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.430
 much more than lose 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 from the appearance of diffraction the same 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.680
 the settings set the aperture f16 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:48.239
 nickname clamp the depth preview 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:51.170
 the sharpness of the other lens will see 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.830
 the hole has become quite miserable 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.690
 as soon as you plug in the usual way 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.680
 connected connected device 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.970
 the lens iris is reset again at the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.230
 the widest so if you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.450
 Connect the lens in the usual way 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.269
 then unscrew something you know what 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.010
 the diaphragm is flying you 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:18.290
 most likely there is a camera off 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.380
 then no ice is included then fly off and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.970
 Macro need to install it every 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 again and then press two buttons 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.810
 unscrew 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.620
 now how to connect this 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.210
 the lens of the camera itself 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.860
 for this you will need a reverse 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.620
 fifty eight millimeter ring 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.530
 with a strong ring such a thing with one 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.400
 sides which have to bainer sock with 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.300
 the other side 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.419
 filter thread for the whale 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.590
 Kamensky lens need carving for the whole 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.729
 8 millimeters on this little ring 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.729
 wind it like a light filter 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:10.600
 and connect to the camera document 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.370
 Tina 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.490
 usually end on already set take 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.190
 hooked up and all the pilot you have is great 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.020
 macro lens aperture fixed 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.480
 change it through the camera settings 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.340
 you won't be able to do this in general 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.390
 macro photography it is usually delivered 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.740
 once and then removed 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.740
 good luck on this all
