00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 called himself a military intelligence officer and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.119
 deputies threatened to cripple everyone and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.119
 even grab the plane and 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.009
 according to the witnesses of the incident aboard 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.689
 January the day of bondage has risen already 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.969
 drunk in shorts and flip flops 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.349
 and immediately attracted attention already in 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.570
 cabin recall eyewitnesses 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.550
 he drank a bottle of tequila from the neck and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.469
 went to smoke in the toilet with 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.180
 working smoke detector made members 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.489
 crew to disturb the restless 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.350
 passenger and take away his cigarettes and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.839
 the cigarette lighter went berserk 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 further immediately remembered footage and 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.570
 videotapes 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.670
 today the bondage turned out to be 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.559
 common with an Arab entrepreneur 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.299
 middle-handed and father of three children 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.250
 who actually did not even serve in the army 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.830
 tried for hijacking 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.509
 This very serious charge and for 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.970
 intentional infliction of light harm 

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.220
 health at the hands of bondage built 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.140
 flight attendant denis wafin another one of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.210
 the passengers of bondage broke his nose but that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.950
 being actually drinking buddies handed 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.259
 before the flight they drank together 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090
 no complaints against the defendant 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.130
 does not deny that was drunk on claims 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 that didn't hit anyone and the plane didn't hijack 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.800
 was going to be a waffle conflict which 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.940
 I did not hit and not for a strong moment but where 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.990
 we want there is a conflict 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.990
 whether the passenger can 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.960
 as I ask not touched he rose 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.650
 hi booze unfolding on the vest 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.520
 I 'll help him on it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.120
 answered him blow world conflict on this 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.040
 there was a farm 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.110
 return to Russia from vacation 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.909
 sober rowdy did not want 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.190
 it was possible to detain him after three months 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.670
 in Belarus but advocacy today 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.840
 insisted their client deserves only 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.200
 administrative punishment for petty 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.189
 disorderly conduct indisputably broom his hands 15 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
 days could lead 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.250
 sweep around the airport those actions 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.959
 which he committed they beyond 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.090
 criminal liability whatever the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 there was a jury decision to fly planes 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.230
 some airlines sergey kabalov 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.299
 just can't right after the incident in 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.970
 The State Duma was introduced a bill which 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.799
 allows airlines to not allow 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.720
 board passengers who have been caught in 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.389
 hooliganism or heavier 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.499
 blacklisted crimes 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.720
 unreliable passengers if such 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:36.000
 will appear 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.000
 or bondage will surely stand 1
