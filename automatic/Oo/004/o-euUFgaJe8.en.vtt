00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.090 
best when it's in the muddy water
because<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> spinner

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100

here<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> looks<00:00:45.329> almost<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.750> propeller

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
here that looks almost like a propeller

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.610 
here that looks almost like a propeller
and<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.969> creates<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> flash<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> water

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and it creates a flash in the water

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.450 
and it creates a flash in the water
which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.039> why<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:51.329> better<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.920> with

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
which is why you're better off on a with

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.930 
which is why you're better off on a with
muddy<00:00:54.090> waters<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.539> stuff<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.620> you

aren't like these do this is supposed to
over<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> tail<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:10.229> also<00:01:10.979> creates<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
over the tail and this also creates a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
over the tail and this also creates a
flash<00:01:11.850> through<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> water<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:13.860> like

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
flash through at the water so look like

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
flash through at the water so look like
the<00:01:14.159> scales<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> fish<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:16.350> that

may<00:02:30.790> need<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.090> throw<00:02:31.360> split<00:02:31.660> shot<00:02:31.959> on<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.920> your

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
may need to throw split shot on to your

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.780 
may need to throw split shot on to your
line<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.430> well<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.970> just<00:02:34.780> jig<00:02:35.500> these<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:36.550> like

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
line as well and just jig these not like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.339 
line as well and just jig these not like
you<00:02:37.090> know<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.209> lot<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.900> make<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.319> like

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
you know a lot like to make it go like

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.110 
you know a lot like to make it go like
that<00:02:38.500> throughout<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.920> water<00:02:39.099> just<00:02:39.340> very

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that throughout the water just very

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.009 
that throughout the water just very
slowly<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:41.410> twitch<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.019> you

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
slowly just twitch it like that and you

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.350 
slowly just twitch it like that and you
will<00:02:44.290> catch<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.220> very<00:02:45.370> small<00:02:45.670> blue<00:02:45.819> heels<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
will catch a very small blue heels and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.339 
will catch a very small blue heels and
they<00:02:46.870> actually<00:02:47.019> work<00:02:47.319> very<00:02:47.349> well<00:02:47.860> for<00:02:48.099> me<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> I

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
they actually work very well for me so I

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.089 
they actually work very well for me so I
mean<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.610> don't<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.030> these<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:53.290> storm

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
mean if you don't have these like storm

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.160 
mean if you don't have these like storm
beats<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:54.670> yet<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:56.019> these

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
beats but yet you know you have these

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.660 
beats but yet you know you have these
things<00:02:56.489> use<00:02:57.489> them<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:58.329> won't<00:02:58.630> let<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.049> down

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
things use them they won't let you down

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.430 
things use them they won't let you down
um<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.329> that's<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:02.049> um<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:04.329> for<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.079> rod<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
um so that's that um and for a rod and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.259 
um so that's that um and for a rod and
reel<00:03:05.500> combo<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> use<00:03:07.239> old<00:03:07.720> Troy<00:03:08.019> this

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
reel combo I like to use old Troy this

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.150 
reel combo I like to use old Troy this
specifically<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:11.190> 4<00:03:12.190> foot<00:03:12.549> 8<00:03:13.799> quantum<00:03:14.799> teton

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
specifically is a 4 foot 8 quantum teton

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 
specifically is a 4 foot 8 quantum teton
very<00:03:15.519> smooth<00:03:15.849> drag<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:17.019> 3<00:03:17.680> ball<00:03:17.829> being

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
very smooth drag and it's a 3 ball being

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.509 
very smooth drag and it's a 3 ball being
real<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.810> rod<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.230> extremely<00:03:20.829> strong<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.340> mean

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
real the rod is extremely strong I mean

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.860 
real the rod is extremely strong I mean
you<00:03:21.850> know<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.720> quantum<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
you know it's quantum and on to that I

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.539 
you know it's quantum and on to that I
have<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:29.200> crawdad<00:03:30.010> lore<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.980> works<00:03:32.980> very<00:03:33.430> well

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
have a crawdad lore it works very well

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.460 
have a crawdad lore it works very well
for<00:03:33.730> panfish<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.810> bass<00:03:37.260> especially<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.350> very

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
for panfish and bass especially the very

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.259 
for panfish and bass especially the very
small<00:03:38.829> when<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.220> about<00:03:39.519> an<00:03:39.760> inch<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.150> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
small when this is about an inch and a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.930 
small when this is about an inch and a
quarter<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.250> catch<00:03:42.459> basically

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
quarter so you can catch basically

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.220 
quarter so you can catch basically
anything<00:03:43.209> on<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.690> um<00:03:44.590> but<00:03:45.630> if<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.930> want<00:03:47.139> to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
anything on this um but if you want to

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.340 
anything on this um but if you want to
catch<00:03:47.430> more<00:03:48.430> fish<00:03:49.019> instead<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.139> bigger<00:03:50.350> fish

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
catch more fish instead of bigger fish

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.920 
catch more fish instead of bigger fish
use<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.530> shad<00:03:53.799> dart<00:03:54.069> with<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> split<00:03:54.609> shot<00:03:54.930> or

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
use the shad dart with a split shot or

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:07.430 
use the shad dart with a split shot or
you<00:03:56.470> can<00:03:56.650> use

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.540 

hold<00:04:08.440> on<00:04:12.390> little<00:04:13.390> size-10<00:04:14.290> hawks<00:04:14.740> wait<00:04:15.040> body

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
hold on little size-10 hawks wait body

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.170 
hold on little size-10 hawks wait body
size<00:04:15.850> tens<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:17.010> think<00:04:18.010> their<00:04:18.220> size<00:04:18.430> yeah<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
size tens I think their size yeah the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.220 
size tens I think their size yeah the
size<00:04:19.390> tens<00:04:20.910> these<00:04:21.910> believe<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.870> or<00:04:22.930> not<00:04:23.020> they

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
size tens these believe it or not they

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.740 
size tens these believe it or not they
work<00:04:23.790> with<00:04:26.610> warm<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.540> put<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
work with warm on this like if you put a

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.430 
work with warm on this like if you put a
little<00:04:28.900> wax<00:04:29.230> worm<00:04:29.530> on<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.550> night<00:04:30.820> crawler<00:04:31.410> or<00:04:32.410> a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
little wax worm on a night crawler or a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.630 
little wax worm on a night crawler or a
garden<00:04:33.280> worm<00:04:33.430> on<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.030> they<00:04:34.570> work<00:04:34.750> very<00:04:34.780> well

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
garden worm on that they work very well

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920 
garden worm on that they work very well
but<00:04:36.640> you're<00:04:36.820> also<00:04:37.180> gonna<00:04:37.390> need<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.570> bobber

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
but you're also gonna need a bobber

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.720 
but you're also gonna need a bobber
ahead<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.470> that<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:40.170> what<00:04:41.170> you<00:04:41.290> do<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.920> when

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
ahead of that and what you do is when

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.360 
ahead of that and what you do is when
the<00:04:42.940> fish<00:04:43.300> takes<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.720> bobber<00:04:43.990> down<00:04:44.340> let<00:04:45.340> it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
the fish takes the bobber down let it

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.190 
the fish takes the bobber down let it
take<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:46.000> worm<00:04:46.150> for<00:04:46.390> about<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> second<00:04:47.080> because

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
take the worm for about a second because

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.450 
take the worm for about a second because
I<00:04:47.350> mean<00:04:47.590> you're<00:04:47.710> not<00:04:47.800> gonna<00:04:47.920> be<00:04:48.070> throwing<00:04:48.370> a

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
I mean you're not gonna be throwing a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.240 
I mean you're not gonna be throwing a
whole<00:04:48.730> warm<00:04:49.210> on<00:04:49.360> there<00:04:49.570> because<00:04:50.410> then<00:04:50.830> you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
whole warm on there because then you

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.560 
whole warm on there because then you
know<00:04:51.370> you'd<00:04:51.580> have<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.730> let<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.000> fish<00:04:52.180> take<00:04:52.420> it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
know you'd have to let the fish take it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.940 
know you'd have to let the fish take it
for<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> long<00:04:52.930> time<00:04:53.200> if<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.440> love<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.710> take<00:04:53.830> this

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
for a long time if you love to take this

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.760 
for a long time if you love to take this
the<00:04:54.550> hook<00:04:54.910> for<00:04:55.180> too<00:04:55.330> long<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:56.320> could<00:04:56.500> swallow

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
the hook for too long it could swallow

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.280 
the hook for too long it could swallow
the<00:04:57.100> hook<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.700> fish<00:04:57.880> will<00:04:58.180> die<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:59.020> just

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
the hook and the fish will die so just

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.010 
the hook and the fish will die so just
to<00:05:00.070> keep<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.520> mind

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
to keep that in mind

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.770 
to keep that in mind
I'm<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.500> use<00:05:03.040> pieces<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.880> worm<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.630> also

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
I'm to use pieces of worm and you also
