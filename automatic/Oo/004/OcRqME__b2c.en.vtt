concrete path striking with the heel

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.719 
concrete path striking with the heel
you'd<00:01:05.409> end<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.680> breaking<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.250> bones<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:06.670> your

just<00:02:17.080> take<00:02:17.260> off

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
just take off

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.710 
just take off
when<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.760> out<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:19.940> running<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.480> feels

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
when I'm out there running it feels

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260 
when I'm out there running it feels
really<00:02:21.020> natural<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.860> run<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.370> think<00:02:22.910> about

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
really natural to just run I think about

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.350 
really natural to just run I think about
staying<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.140> my<00:02:24.260> forefoot<00:02:24.890> being<00:02:25.550> relaxed<00:02:25.970> in

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
staying on my forefoot being relaxed in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
staying on my forefoot being relaxed in
the<00:02:26.480> upper<00:02:26.750> body<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.440> slight<00:02:27.740> lean<00:02:27.980> forward

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
the upper body and a slight lean forward

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.740 
the upper body and a slight lean forward
and<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:28.910> you're<00:02:29.030> out<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.600> just

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and if you're out there and you're just

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
and if you're out there and you're just
thinking<00:02:29.930> about<00:02:30.260> those<00:02:30.560> three<00:02:30.980> things<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
thinking about those three things the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.670 
thinking about those three things the
form<00:02:32.240> just<00:02:32.450> takes<00:02:32.750> care<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.020> itself<00:02:33.350> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
form just takes care of itself it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.710 
form just takes care of itself it
becomes<00:02:33.950> very<00:02:34.040> natural<00:02:34.730> when<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.209> get<00:02:35.450> tired

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
becomes very natural when I get tired

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.870 
becomes very natural when I get tired
and<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.140> start<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.830> see<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.130> weaknesses<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.760> my

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
and I start to see the weaknesses in my

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.449 
and I start to see the weaknesses in my
form<00:02:38.239> come<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.989> generally<00:02:39.620> leaning

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
form come out it's generally leaning

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.580 
form come out it's generally leaning
back<00:02:40.730> getting<00:02:41.480> really<00:02:42.020> tight<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.500> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
back getting really tight in the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410 
back getting really tight in the
shoulders<00:02:42.620> if<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.459> notice<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.239> recognize

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
shoulders if I notice that and recognize

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.080 
shoulders if I notice that and recognize
that<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.050> happening<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.430> rectify<00:02:46.760> it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
that that's happening I can rectify it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.240 
that that's happening I can rectify it
by<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.480> slightly<00:02:47.780> forward<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
by that slightly forward and then the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.930 
by that slightly forward and then the
running<00:02:49.580> takes<00:02:49.760> care<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> itself<00:02:51.940> an

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
running takes care of itself an

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.479

you're going to change the working
muscles<00:05:35.200> slightly<00:05:36.010> so<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.760> need<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.120> take<00:05:37.270> the
