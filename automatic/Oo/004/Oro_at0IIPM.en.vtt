mine alone but after what happened with

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.839 
mine alone but after what happened with
the<00:02:24.810> circle<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.440> seeing<00:02:26.190> how<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.370> shadows

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
the circle and seeing how the shadows

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.330 
the circle and seeing how the shadows
seeped<00:02:27.209> into<00:02:27.510> them<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.290> reminded<00:02:28.829> me<00:02:28.890> how<00:02:29.160> my

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
seeped into them it reminded me how my

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.850 
seeped into them it reminded me how my
strong<00:02:29.760> connection<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.690> kept<00:02:31.590> me<00:02:31.799> from

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
strong connection to you kept me from

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.670 
strong connection to you kept me from
the<00:02:31.950> same<00:02:32.280> fate<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.329> I<00:02:33.569> think<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.470> in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the same fate you see I think that in

the same fate you see I think that in
the<00:02:34.769> years<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> watched<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:35.970> West

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
the years that I watched you in West

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.809 
the years that I watched you in West
Harbor<00:02:36.660> maybe<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.709> wasn't<00:02:38.099> neglecting<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
mayor at all but seeing what could save

it if only the circle would realize it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
land that if one of them fought for it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.620 
land that if one of them fought for it
if<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.860> them<00:02:50.010> fought<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.670> did<00:02:50.910> then

if all of them fought as you did then

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.479

something<00:02:52.139> greater<00:02:52.440> could<00:02:52.739> be<00:02:52.829> achieved<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
something greater could be achieved and

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.720 
something greater could be achieved and

battle comes for us again also I fear

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.430 
battle comes for us again also I fear
that<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.269> have<00:03:03.389> not<00:03:03.540> always<00:03:03.750> been<00:03:04.019> honest<00:03:04.380> with

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
that I have not always been honest with

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.550 
that I have not always been honest with
you<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.519> all<00:03:06.150> matters<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:07.760> care<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.560> not

you in all matters I care for you not
friendship<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.250> deeper<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.630> runs<00:03:12.930> powerfully

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
friendship but deeper it runs powerfully

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.470 
friendship but deeper it runs powerfully
within<00:03:13.980> me<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.639> tried<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.239> fight<00:03:15.450> it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
within me and I have tried to fight it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.740 
within me and I have tried to fight it
for<00:03:15.630> some<00:03:15.959> time<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:17.489> such<00:03:17.790> things<00:03:18.150> cannot<00:03:18.569> be

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
for some time but such things cannot be

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:34.330 
for some time but such things cannot be
held<00:03:18.930> silent<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.530> long

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.559 

postponing<00:03:35.340> what

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.289 

I<00:03:39.739> have<00:03:40.739> no<00:03:40.950> intention<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.609> letting<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.939> sleep

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
I have no intention of letting you sleep

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.660 
I have no intention of letting you sleep
but<00:03:42.719> I<00:03:42.900> think<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.069> come<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> an<00:03:44.579> agreement

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
but I think we can come to an agreement

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.239 
but I think we can come to an agreement
let<00:03:45.450> us<00:03:45.569> promise<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.079> speak<00:03:46.379> no<00:03:46.620> more<00:03:46.650> until

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:47.249 
let us promise to speak no more until

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.910 
let us promise to speak no more until
the<00:03:47.340> morrow<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.909> we<00:03:48.780> shall<00:03:48.989> enjoy<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.650> brief

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the morrow and we shall enjoy what brief

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:03.630 
the morrow and we shall enjoy what brief
time<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.700> together
