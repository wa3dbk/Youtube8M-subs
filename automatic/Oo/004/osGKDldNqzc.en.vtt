00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
just a plain field and then we we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
just a plain field and then we we
started<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.869> garden<00:00:28.080> over

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

started with the little garden over
there<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.460> plot<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
there a little plot and then what we

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
there a little plot and then what we
wanted<00:00:32.279> its<00:00:32.550> make<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> bigger<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> added<00:00:34.410> more

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
wanted its make it bigger and added more

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.400 
wanted its make it bigger and added more
crops<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.180> came<00:00:36.480> along<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.170> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
crops and then it just came along and we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.090 
crops and then it just came along and we
made<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.280> actually<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
made it I actually think it's a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.860 
made it I actually think it's a
opportunity<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:41.700> taken<00:00:42.170> because<00:00:43.610> we<00:00:44.610> got<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
opportunity well taken because we got to

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.590 
opportunity well taken because we got to
open<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> new<00:00:45.989> Learning<00:00:46.620> Center<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:48.059> campus

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
open a new Learning Center in our campus

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.430 
open a new Learning Center in our campus
so<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> guess<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:51.440> taking

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so I guess it will just be like taking

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
so I guess it will just be like taking
