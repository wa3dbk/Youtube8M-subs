the<00:01:50.020> old<00:01:50.200> part<00:01:50.500> out<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.220> new<00:01:51.369> part<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.789> now<00:01:52.509> for

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the old part out the new part it now for

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.690 
the old part out the new part it now for
our<00:01:52.899> vehicle<00:01:53.350> today<00:01:53.470> all<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.220> got<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.399> do<00:01:54.490> is

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
our vehicle today all we got to do is

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.819 
our vehicle today all we got to do is
cut<00:01:55.240> out<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> old<00:01:55.539> converter<00:01:56.020> fit<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> new

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
cut out the old converter fit the new

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.649 
cut out the old converter fit the new
catalytic<00:01:57.340> converter<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.820> there<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.210> then

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
catalytic converter in there and then

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.480 
catalytic converter in there and then
weld<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.020> all<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.350> now<00:01:59.380> for<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> direct<00:02:00.310> fit

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
weld it all up now for a direct fit

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.889 
weld it all up now for a direct fit
application<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.330> might<00:02:01.479> actually<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:01.780> be

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
application you might actually just be

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.359 
application you might actually just be
bolting<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.439> in<00:02:02.500> which<00:02:02.649> would<00:02:02.799> make<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.039> easier

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
bolting it in which would make it easier

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.789 
bolting it in which would make it easier
okay<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.570> time<00:02:04.780> for<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.080> numbers<00:02:05.470> we've

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
okay so time for the numbers we've

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.080 
okay so time for the numbers we've
installed<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> color<00:02:06.460> conversion<00:02:06.700> our

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
installed the color conversion our

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.880 
installed the color conversion our
Belvedere<00:02:07.600> down<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.050> before<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:08.440> after<00:02:08.679> dyno

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
Belvedere down the before and after dyno

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.949 
Belvedere down the before and after dyno
now<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.519> have<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.789> say<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.149> has<00:02:10.390> cooled<00:02:10.720> off<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
now we have to say it has cooled off a

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.240 
now we have to say it has cooled off a
little<00:02:11.200> bit<00:02:11.349> since<00:02:11.590> we've<00:02:11.709> done<00:02:11.739> our<00:02:11.950> after

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
little bit since we've done our after

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.580 
little bit since we've done our after
nine<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.420> see<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:14.260> picked<00:02:14.500> up

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
nine up but as you can see we picked up

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.100 
nine up but as you can see we picked up
three<00:02:14.830> horsepower<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.610> torque<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.209> flat<00:02:16.510> no

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
three horsepower and torque is flat no

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.110 
three horsepower and torque is flat no
gain<00:02:17.350> no<00:02:17.380> loss<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.459> by<00:02:18.580> adding<00:02:18.760> kalloch

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
gain no loss so by adding kalloch

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.610 
gain no loss so by adding kalloch
