00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello and welcome to me 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.930
 tile weather with a weather extra 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 and i would like to have a good weather 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 deal with singularities 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.059
 In the middle of May you always have this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 topic in the press in the media 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 generally the icy saints are premature 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 the ice saints come too late 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.029
 is cold, that is nonsense or 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 Is there something of this theory that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.260
 is still frosty in the middle of may 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.849
 and ask us first who or what to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 Cuckoos are the most icy ones 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.330
 and since we have a whole corner 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 go back to the fifth century 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 That was a few martyrs bishops 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.840
 the holy day and those are days of remembrance 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.910
 between the 11 0 15 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 what these people is thought that goes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.879
 then go on the eleventh time with the mum tus 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.829
 on the twelfth time with the pancratius 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.930
 thirteenth may is then the servatius 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.360
 dran bonifaz together 14 may and the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 sofia on may 15 or better known too 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 as a cold sophie after our calendar 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 reforms would we now have the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.020
 Eisheiligen however later are only 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.730
 between the 22 on 26 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 that means a reason for this reason 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.470
 Gregor has the calendar 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 reformed the Gregorian 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 calendar reform that was 1582 he has 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.580
 simply put in the time span 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.619
 the totally wrong we have to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.509
 actually eleven days later 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.040
 that took a long time in central europe 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 until the calendar reform prevails 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 that was so between 1717 152 or 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.070
 was, for example, 1752 in england 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 directly from 2 september on the 14 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.409
 september remodeled that means there was 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.079
 there was no 3 4 and 5 september 1792 there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 it went straight eleven days on 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 Accordingly, that was just 1000 years 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.939
 later than this pope gregor this one 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.860
 calendar has reformed after these 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.630
 icy broom martyrs and this one 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.939
 bishops and accordingly are too 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.399
 our igloo now eleven days later 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.829
 that means they would be on May 22 first 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 start and would until the 26th 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.670
 So I do not have to hang it up one 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.829
 also has in weather research in the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.750
 whole climate data found out that 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 Not heaped in the middle of May then 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.259
 just after our icy saints 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.149
 frosts occur that come in part 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.849
 really a bit later 1 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.129
 1922 23 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.970
 So you are not sure if you are 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.950
 even after the 15 after the cold 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.920
 it is always possible to exhibit the plants 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.030
 still somehow frostbite give ground frost 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.860
 Summer plants can do that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 so tolerated just over zero degrees 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.130
 but if you get that good tomato out 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 plant after cold sophie it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.030
 come again the cold real ones 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.860
 Ice Saints between 22 and 26 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 everything can be too late 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.010
 even the harvest fails for tomatoes 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 they'll get under five degrees 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 they can cough and break something 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.700
 accordingly one should still wait 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
 at least until the 20 25 times the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 Keep an eye on the weather 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.459
 if there really cold again 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.100
 come and then maybe the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 plant out to the outside all good 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.770
 See you soon for the next weather extra 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.770
 here at the tile meters
