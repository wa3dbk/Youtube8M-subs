things to see in a relationship and the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.270 
things to see in a relationship and the
last<00:02:36.629> one<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> highlight<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
last one I want to highlight is a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.339 
last one I want to highlight is a
slightly<00:02:38.700> unconventional<00:02:39.060> relationship<00:02:39.750> but

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
slightly unconventional relationship but

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
slightly unconventional relationship but
it<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.680> Meghan<00:02:41.370> Preston<00:02:41.819> from<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it is Meghan Preston from the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.790 
it is Meghan Preston from the
president's<00:02:42.510> daughter<00:02:42.660> sees<00:02:43.110> by<00:02:43.410> Alan

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.460 
president's daughter sees by Alan
Emerson<00:02:44.250> white<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.390> book<00:02:45.750> series<00:02:46.260> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
Emerson white this is a book series that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.170 
Emerson white this is a book series that
I've<00:02:46.980> talked<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> couple<00:02:47.640> times<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.090> my

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
I've talked about a couple times on my

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.580 
I've talked about a couple times on my
channel<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.629> think<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.050> really<00:02:49.319> underrated

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
channel I think it's a really underrated

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.280 
channel I think it's a really underrated
book<00:02:50.010> series<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.790> reason<00:02:51.090> why<00:02:51.180> this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
book series the reason why this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.780 
book series the reason why this
relationship<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.650> unconventional<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.730> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
relationship is unconventional so to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
relationship is unconventional so to
speak<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.360> they're<00:02:54.629> not<00:02:54.750> really<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
speak is because they're not really in a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.410 
speak is because they're not really in a
relationship<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.430> probably<00:02:57.150> never

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
relationship and they probably never

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.509 
relationship and they probably never
would<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.959> when<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.379> book<00:02:58.530> starts<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.950> meg<00:02:59.370> is

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
would be when the book starts out meg is

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.720 
would be when the book starts out meg is
in<00:02:59.670> high<00:02:59.819> school<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.569> Preston<00:03:01.290> works<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:02.099> her

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
in high school and Preston works for her

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.059 
in high school and Preston works for her
mom<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.209> he<00:03:03.330> has<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:04.050> his<00:03:04.260> youngest<00:03:04.769> in

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
mom so he has to be at his youngest in

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.100 
mom so he has to be at his youngest in
his<00:03:05.250> early<00:03:05.700> 20s<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.239> he's<00:03:06.690> probably<00:03:06.870> even

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
his early 20s but he's probably even

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
his early 20s but he's probably even
older<00:03:07.440> than<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:07.890> they<00:03:08.010> probably<00:03:08.190> have

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
older than that so they probably have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.399 
older than that so they probably have
quite<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> few<00:03:09.420> years<00:03:09.569> between<00:03:09.810> them<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.319> it's

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
quite a few years between them and it's

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.690 
quite a few years between them and it's
kind<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.650> illegal<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.550> together

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
kind of illegal for them to be together

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000 
kind of illegal for them to be together
technically<00:03:12.569> but<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.319> over<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> course<00:03:13.920> of
