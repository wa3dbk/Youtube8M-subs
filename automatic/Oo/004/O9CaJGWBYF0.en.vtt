actually<00:00:56.520> said<00:00:56.780> basically<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.899> he<00:00:58.020> was

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually said basically what he was

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
actually said basically what he was
saying<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> even<00:00:59.250> though<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> weapon

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
saying is that even though this weapon

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
saying is that even though this weapon
does<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.329> arcane<00:01:00.719> scaling<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.559> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
does have arcane scaling that doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.020 
does have arcane scaling that doesn't
necessarily<00:01:01.980> mean<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
necessarily mean you're gonna get a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
necessarily mean you're gonna get a
benefit<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.629> off<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> bat<00:01:04.100> basically<00:01:05.100> what

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
benefit right off the bat basically what

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.649 
benefit right off the bat basically what
you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> fortify<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you have to do is fortify it with a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.390 
you have to do is fortify it with a
blood<00:01:06.930> gemstone<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> gives<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.070> type<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
blood gemstone that gives it a type of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
blood gemstone that gives it a type of
attack<00:01:08.670> other<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.299> physical<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.930> then

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
attack other than physical and then

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.719 
attack other than physical and then
that's<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:10.860> gonna<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> benefit

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that's when you're gonna get the benefit

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.630 
that's when you're gonna get the benefit
of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> arcane<00:01:12.390> scaling<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.490> if

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of the arcane scaling I don't know if

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
of the arcane scaling I don't know if
that<00:01:14.760> applies<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.330> every<00:01:15.810> weapon<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> has

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that applies to every weapon that has

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
that applies to every weapon that has
arcane<00:01:16.860> scaling<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.729> physical<00:01:18.210> attack

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
arcane scaling but has physical attack

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
arcane scaling but has physical attack
but<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> something<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> he<00:01:20.189> did<00:01:20.220> point

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
but it was something that he did point

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.100 
but it was something that he did point
out<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.720> thought<00:01:21.750> was

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
out and it was something I thought was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
out and it was something I thought was
worth<00:01:22.259> mentioning<00:01:22.430> with<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.549> being<00:01:23.729> said

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
worth mentioning with that being said

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
worth mentioning with that being said
there<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.240> pros<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> cons<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> weapon

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
there are pros and cons to this weapon

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.830 
there are pros and cons to this weapon
and<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.220> guess<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.390> major

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and I guess I would say that it's major

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350 
and I guess I would say that it's major
con<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.890> fact<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> blade<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
con is the fact that when this blade is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.520 
con is the fact that when this blade is
fully<00:01:30.659> extended

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
fully extended

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
fully extended
most<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.369> its<00:01:32.490> moveset<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.909> actually<00:01:33.329> pretty

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
most of its moveset is actually pretty

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.929 
most of its moveset is actually pretty
useless<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.860> our<00:01:35.009> tools<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> bad

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
useless the our tools are not that bad

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.060 
useless the our tools are not that bad
but<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.930> fact<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> really

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
but the fact that they take a really

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
but the fact that they take a really
long<00:01:38.189> time<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.799> kind<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> sets<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
long time to actually do kind of sets it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
long time to actually do kind of sets it
back<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:42.210> somebody<00:01:42.720> really

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
back a little bit all somebody really

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
back a little bit all somebody really
needs<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.740> dash<00:01:43.950> backwards<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
needs to do is just dash backwards and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.550 
needs to do is just dash backwards and
nine<00:01:45.119> times<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> ten<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:46.170> gonna<00:01:46.380> get

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
nine times out of ten they're gonna get

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
nine times out of ten they're gonna get
out<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.860> its<00:01:47.009> reach<00:01:47.250> before<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:48.299> do

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
out of its reach before you actually do

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.319 
out of its reach before you actually do
the<00:01:48.810> attack<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.520> rest<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> its<00:01:51.000> moveset

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the attack but the rest of its moveset

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.080 
the attack but the rest of its moveset
is<00:01:51.360> pretty<00:01:51.899> bad<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:53.009> ones<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.610> vertical

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
is pretty bad the are ones are vertical

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
is pretty bad the are ones are vertical
attacks<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.159> since<00:01:56.159> everybody<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.880> much

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
attacks and since everybody pretty much

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
attacks and since everybody pretty much
moves<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.899> PvP<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.280> easy<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
moves a lot in PvP it's really easy to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
moves a lot in PvP it's really easy to
dodge<00:01:59.930> even<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.229> trying<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> dodge

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
dodge even if you're not trying to dodge

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
dodge even if you're not trying to dodge
them<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.000> folded<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.659> move

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
them but when it's folded in that move

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.399 
them but when it's folded in that move
set<00:02:04.140> basically<00:02:04.649> makes<00:02:05.009> everything<00:02:05.340> else<00:02:05.610> okay

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
set basically makes everything else okay

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
set basically makes everything else okay
when<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.590> folded<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:08.729> much

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
when it's folded in you can pretty much

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
when it's folded in you can pretty much
spam<00:02:09.330> r1<00:02:09.869> until<00:02:10.319> you're<00:02:10.470> about<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.770> run<00:02:10.890> out

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
spam r1 until you're about to run out

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.009 
spam r1 until you're about to run out

to do is just hit l1 and nine times out

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.270 
to do is just hit l1 and nine times out
of<00:02:15.269> ten<00:02:15.569> when<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.349> transform<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.950> weapon

of ten when you transform the weapon

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.729 
of ten when you transform the weapon
it's<00:02:17.519> still<00:02:17.879> gonna<00:02:18.060> hit<00:02:18.269> them<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
it's still gonna hit them if you do that

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.500
