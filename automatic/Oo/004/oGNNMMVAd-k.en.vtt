00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
it warms up they just seem to fly off so

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.310 
it warms up they just seem to fly off so
I<00:03:31.310> could<00:03:31.460> say<00:03:31.790> that's<00:03:32.660> how<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.810> plopped<00:03:33.200> me

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I could say that's how I plopped me
