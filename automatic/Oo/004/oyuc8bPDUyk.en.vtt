they're<00:03:34.190> basically<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.790> same<00:03:34.820> thing<00:03:35.030> they've

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
they're basically the same thing they've

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.210 
they're basically the same thing they've
just<00:03:35.810> added<00:03:36.050> some<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.590> molasses<00:03:37.190> that

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
just added some of the molasses that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.280 
just added some of the molasses that
they've<00:03:37.610> stripped<00:03:38.030> away<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.510> create<00:03:39.050> white

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
they've stripped away to create white

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.040 
they've stripped away to create white
sugar<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.860> added<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.760> back<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.209> for<00:03:41.600> color<00:03:41.810> and

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
sugar and added it back in for color and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.470 
sugar and added it back in for color and
flavor<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.890> brown<00:03:43.100> sugar<00:03:43.430> is<00:03:43.670> basically<00:03:44.209> white

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
flavor so brown sugar is basically white

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.440 
flavor so brown sugar is basically white
sugar<00:03:44.780> with<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.989> little<00:03:45.080> coloring<00:03:45.590> added<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.130> it

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
sugar with a little coloring added to it

sugar with a little coloring added to it
the<00:03:47.450> final<00:03:47.930> myth<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.370> exercise

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
the final myth is that you just exercise

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.449 
the final myth is that you just exercise
so<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.480> need<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> sports<00:03:51.110> drink<00:03:51.320> that's<00:03:52.250> not

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459
