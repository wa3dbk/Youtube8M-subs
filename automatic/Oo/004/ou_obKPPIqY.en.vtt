00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:05.339
 we are used to that after vacuuming 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.230
 you must go wet 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.120
 vacuum cleaner with aqua filter thomas genius s1 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.109
 There are two models of aquafilter and eco 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 aquafilter 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.919
 differ in color and the last bit 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.529
 fewer baits included 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.579
 but the main advantage is the same 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.159
 aquafilter 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.619
 it is best to cope with the dust water 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.589
 in it both large and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.560
 fine dirt particles look over here 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.720
 pour clean water turn on the vacuum cleaner 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.390
 a powerful whirlwind is created in the aqua filter 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.970
 By the way, the vacuum cleaners themselves are also very powerful. 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 of excellent suction power all rubbish and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.610
 dust 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.400
 going from the surface fall into 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.500
 water vortex and also they remain 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.750
 come back through the weekend 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 air hole as it happens in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 conventional vacuum cleaners and even if some 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.260
 micro mote will try to escape 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 out on her way additionally get up 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 four filter as we see in the no dust 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.499
 no chances 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.679
 and we can safely do only dry 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:09.899
 cleaning vacuum cleaners with aquafilter 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.509
 carpets are equally well cleaned and 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.060
 smooth surfaces are especially useful 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.749
 for such delicate coatings as parquet 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.880
 and laminate 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:20.189
 known that these materials are not too 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 favor moisture and frequent mopping 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.569
 especially badly wrung rag can 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.270
 time to spoil them and dry cleaning 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.189
 Vacuuming with aqua filter and surface 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 save and completely eliminate dust 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.159
 by the way 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 want to see how much can be 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.469
 dust seemingly clean room just 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 open the aqua filter compartment 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.090
 after cleaning just drain the dirty water 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.399
 and wash all parts 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.590
 another huge plus dry cleaning with 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.579
 aquafilter is the absence of a bag 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.130
 dust collector 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.689
 agree to take out the dirty bag is not 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.759
 too pleasant procedure 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.799
 Yes, and you can save on the purchase 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.549
 disposable bags look at the outside 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.069
 genius view with 1 vacuum cleaner and small not 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.259

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.539
 they are maneuverable can be easily removed in 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.090
 room filled with furniture by the way 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.459
 rubber wheels for safekeeping 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.950
 Parquet or laminate can not be afraid 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.110
 Cord length of eight meters is not much 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.260
 have to look for the nearest one every time 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.930
 outlet or extension cord to be worn but 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.030
 here at vacuum cleaners thomas jeunes with one 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.120
 Container for storing nozzles 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.349
 by the way about the nozzles the traditional set of 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.959
 floor carpet brushes 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.239
 slit and furniture attachments have both 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.230
 high-quality home cleaning 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.489

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.799

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.910
 wood collect dust from hard furniture and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.889

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.049
 comfortable here is so wide round 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.880
 a brush with a brush but also as a bonus 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.889
 u aquafilter 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.410
 there is a useful cleaning tool 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.370
 shells and so we see vacuum cleaners thomas 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.160
