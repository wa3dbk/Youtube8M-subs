original orbits one gram and it's a four

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.220 
original orbits one gram and it's a four
star<00:00:41.250> too<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> pretty<00:00:42.149> good<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> then

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
star too so it's pretty good and then

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.069 
star too so it's pretty good and then
when<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.860> forth<00:00:44.129> start<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.079> it's

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
when right here so forth start to it's

when right here so forth start to it's
another<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.739> call<00:00:47.039> original<00:00:47.730> orbit<00:00:47.910> tool<00:00:48.270> by

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
another one call original orbit tool by

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150 
another one call original orbit tool by
clicking<00:00:48.539> orange<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
going to be 3 stars color and then one

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to be 3 stars color and then one
starts<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.710> plain<00:00:59.010> white<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
starts going to be just plain white so
