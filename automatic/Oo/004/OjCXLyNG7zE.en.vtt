brought<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.880> very<00:00:08.910> interesting<00:00:09.870> subject

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
brought up a very interesting subject

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.610 
brought up a very interesting subject
about<00:00:10.830> skin<00:00:11.730> being<00:00:12.030> congested<00:00:12.440> never<00:00:13.440> even

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
about skin being congested never even

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310 
about skin being congested never even
thought<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.730> does<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.150> happen<00:00:15.450> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
thought of that how does that happen so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.109 
thought of that how does that happen so
it's<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.340> nose<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:17.970> get

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
it's not just your nose that can get

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's not just your nose that can get
congested<00:00:18.359> you're<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.189> Oscar

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
congested you're right and and the Oscar

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.400 
congested you're right and and the Oscar
of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> question<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.510> right<00:00:21.720> skin<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.230> get

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
of the question is right skin can get

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
of the question is right skin can get
congested<00:00:22.619> too<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> congestion<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
congested too so what is congestion of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
congested too so what is congestion of
skin<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.650> simply<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> fact<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.670> your

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
skin it's simply the fact that your

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.870 
skin it's simply the fact that your
pores<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:27.960> open<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.740> clean<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
pores are not very open and clean so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
pores are not very open and clean so
pores<00:00:30.240> could<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.750> dirt<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.439> grime<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
pores could have dirt and grime and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
pores could have dirt and grime and
clogged<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:33.030> oil<00:00:33.930> sitting<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
clogged up oil sitting in them and so

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
clogged up oil sitting in them and so
they're<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.940> freely<00:00:36.270> able<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> breathe<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
they're not freely able to breathe and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
they're not freely able to breathe and
and<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> nutshell<00:00:39.149> means

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and that's really in a nutshell means

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
and that's really in a nutshell means
congestion<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.559> skin<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.430> does<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
congestion of skin and what does that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.479 
congestion of skin and what does that
lead<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.260> things<00:00:43.410> blackheads<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
lead to a lot of things blackheads and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
lead to a lot of things blackheads and
whiteheads<00:00:44.719> these<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.289> common

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
whiteheads these are the two common

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.069 
whiteheads these are the two common
problems<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> direct<00:00:48.239> outcome<00:00:48.600> off

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
problems that are a direct outcome off

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.180 
problems that are a direct outcome off
your<00:00:49.379> skin<00:00:49.680> being<00:00:49.950> congested<00:00:50.719> blackheads<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
your skin being congested blackheads are

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
your skin being congested blackheads are
when<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> pores<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:54.000> hardened<00:00:54.750> sebum

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
when the pores have hardened sebum

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
when the pores have hardened sebum
inside<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> sebum<00:00:56.969> comes

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
inside of them and when this sebum comes

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
inside of them and when this sebum comes
into<00:00:57.539> contact<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.140> oxygen<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.340> turns<00:00:59.579> black

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
into contact with oxygen it turns black

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.180 
into contact with oxygen it turns black
so<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.440> tiny<00:01:01.710> black<00:01:02.160> dot

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so there is this little tiny black dot

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.789 
so there is this little tiny black dot
on<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:02.969> skin<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> blackhead

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
on your skin which really is a blackhead

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
on your skin which really is a blackhead
Whitehead<00:01:05.700> essentially<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.750> except

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
Whitehead essentially the same except

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
Whitehead essentially the same except
the<00:01:07.439> sebum<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> covered<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> thin<00:01:09.150> layer<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the sebum is covered by a thin layer of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
the sebum is covered by a thin layer of
skin<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.020> never<00:01:10.229> comes<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> contact<00:01:10.920> with

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
skin it never comes in contact with

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
skin it never comes in contact with
atmospheric<00:01:11.549> oxygen<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> doesn't<00:01:13.439> turn

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
atmospheric oxygen so it doesn't turn

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
atmospheric oxygen so it doesn't turn
black<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> does<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.939> pearly<00:01:15.509> white

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
black but it does have this pearly white

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.469 
black but it does have this pearly white
appearance<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.640> very<00:01:17.670> pleasing<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
appearance that is not very pleasing to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.109 
appearance that is not very pleasing to
look<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.500> aside<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.220> blackheads<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
look at so aside from blackheads and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
look at so aside from blackheads and
whiteheads<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.170> skin<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.770> congested

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

potentially<00:01:30.540> could<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.950> general<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
potentially could and in general it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.330 
potentially could and in general it
