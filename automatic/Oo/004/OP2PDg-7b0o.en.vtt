00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.410
 Hello dear friends with you me and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 today i will show you a mod which 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 adds to us in your desktop wallpaper if you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.029
 thought that I am now on the background of some 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 no carpet it was exactly the wallpaper in our 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 Wallpaper is a lot of textures and now I will give you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 I'll show it in principle yes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 wallpaper we craft very easy for us 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.040
 need to put here and so here are three papers and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.800
 3 wool will turn out immediately six oboin 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 such we call we can not stick 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
 wallpaper on the floor or on the ceiling because 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 it would not be logical because where glue 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 wallpaper correctly 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 on the wall so we just push 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 right click on the block where we want 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.750
 stick our wallpaper 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.239
 and here it is covered with white 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 first white then we repeat 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.910
 right click can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 change texture 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.649
 look how much we can 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.719
 be textures them really very 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.910
 very very much and you can choose 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 I will not post any here 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 each you can just look here 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 when I now have them what they are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.750
 happen and here in principle we already went by 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.189
 second round 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 but also let's pick some 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.310
 beautiful for example i like it so much me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.320
 like for example I have a board here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 obsidian i want to make them like 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 as if we no longer have boards 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.869
 look for this texture again 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 when we put next to us 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.390
 already here so and so we close up the whole 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 wall let's take the wallpaper from the creative 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.829
 since I already showed you in principle how 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.740
 Kraft all the way I want to tell you 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.340
 fashion that is required for this 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 additional mod which is called 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.560
 grimes mod score and already here we can 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 find our wallpaper so if you have that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.659
 it does not work does not work then rather 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.259
 all you have downloaded the mod here this Gritsik 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 where is the grivus cord mods now 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.840
 let's post it all so here I am to you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.969
 something didn't show why not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 from there like this glue everything works 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.560
 everything turns out the only problem 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.930
 maybe on the corner when your wallpaper is not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.819
 will be able to understand which texture to choose 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.009
 see they choose this texture therefore 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.910
 I basically will not bathe and will 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.150
 just stick up 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.590
 not moving this unit and so here 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.350
 doing doing doing 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.150
 and almost everything is ready everything is fine in 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.760
 principle wall looks pretty good 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.890
 and not beautiful looks like obsidian 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.270
 I like much more here 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420
 so here is yes glue to be 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 completely beautiful now what I want you 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.480
 show you can color the wallpaper with any 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.240
 dye let's dye and for example 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 I want to paint it red it will be seen 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.740
 on the white wall will be seen best 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.780
 so we get down to this and just 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.600
 also press the right mouse button and our 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.370
 texture gets red color wash off 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.680
 it can not you can only her 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.660
 change to some other and here in 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.790
 In principle, the red wall is ready for us 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.210
 the board can also do it in red 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.890
 we will be kito bloody boards here here 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.770
 what can you do? 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.860
 I do not know any flag, for example, choose 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.080
 hour blue dye and get there well 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.810
 any flag of russia i don't know what 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.910
 you can think you can think 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.190
 what you have enough imagination 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.650
 here and so on we can something already 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.620
 beautiful stick now let's let you 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.990
 will show something unusual you most certainly not 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.240
 know how to break the wall before you here 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.490
 stick wallpaper just break their hand 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.650
 although the description on the site says that their 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.930
 I need to break the difference with an ax, I do not see 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.100
 so I just fuck them with my hand and in 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.310
 basically everything falls out 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.530
