00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 being sincere I do not know what I expected 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.910
 see the rehash that jon layers have 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.160
 that instructive wave of some series 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.200
 regarding an issue in this case the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 music but in this first chapter there 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.639
 seemed to have a well-defined course not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 you can see if it's a dewey fuzz law firm 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380
 playing music or if it's unanimous music 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.029
 with a dewey fuzz law firm in the chapter 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.740
 showed what seems to be a story 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 personal a story that can be 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 fix in a few minutes and then in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.859
 forward take the path of the orchestra 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.260
 but I'm being optimistic and that's not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 it's fine because we are before giovanni and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 paint to do more of the same with a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 touch something more serious but without stopping 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 On the mobile side, the core may be the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.050
 music and if so what good because 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 the production is good and it comes out of a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.579
 chapter more but for the moment left the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.579
 benefit of the doubt the disappearance of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.890
 the lucky cat is amazing did not happen nor 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 two minutes and I already wanted adro pearl to what 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.629
 talent are loaded the boys the series 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 of haruhi I like if the movie the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 I feel like a good closes all that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 comes dragging and follows the cream of the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 peli best wave master rise of course 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 but this is a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
 but far from whoever is wanted is 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.750
 a series that repels by its nature 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.480
 soft and silly lemon is one thing 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.670
 but fun services is a formula that does not 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.860
 convinces no matter how much I liked the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.110
 original series I say fun services because 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 this is a kind of doi in romantic 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.210
 of naga romantic tuition in quotation marks 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 because it's that wave where the protagonist 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 she gets nervous about touching the hand of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 kind boy with soft and silly comedy 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.480
 in the middle and this kind of thing 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 it's fun then there is the series to me not 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.710
 convinced me enough to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.200
 keep looking but here the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.600
 pleasures 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.579
 plastic memories I ended up calling the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.710
 attention starts stumbling up 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
 that begins to build exhibition of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.329
 a little subtle but convincing way 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.280
 with the new guy's wave the theme of 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.500
 the robots that develop emotions do not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 it's like to jump for joy but it 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.909
 thanks that is not the core of the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.039
 issue since in the chapter is handled 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 more the wave of death and knowing 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.390
 say goodbye to something so simple and common 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 which ended with me moving is something 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.019
 imbalanced drama and comedy and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.330
 may the final chapter event 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.099
 has developed in a short time but 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.200
 you feel the intention of what you wanted 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.420
 show now you have to see that weapon 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.760
 later on as it seems to be a series 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 about the characters costs nothing to the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.019
 imagine what the drama will be 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.940
 a few more chapters to see what happens like that 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.319
 that 's all from me because of the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.319
 moment we see each other
