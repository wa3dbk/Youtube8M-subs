00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 Hello friends, today we are going to do 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:25.000
 some delicious butter cookies 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.310
 you will see that they are very very easy to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 do 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:37.590
 to say these cookies we will need 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 flour sugar butter water 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.210
 with a little bit of salt and a little 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.740
 yeast chemical come on let's start 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.670
 we put a case on fire 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.510
 with water 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.510
 the sugar 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.070
 and the butter 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 We will stir until we found 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.250
 totally butter and sugar 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 has totally absorbed by the water 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.040
 when everything is dissolved we will stop 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.410
 We have done the fire on a slow fire and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 now we'll let it cool and we're going to 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.920
 go around once in a while 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 we will put the chemical yeast together with 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
 life 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.290
 let's sift 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.180
 we also put the salt 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 and then we will add a little 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 by little the thread of the butter 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.520
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520
 having a good time 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.920
 when everything is well integrated 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.920
 and the dough is like this with this texture 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.119
 now we will cover it with film paper and the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.720
 we will put for all hours in the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.070
 refrigerator 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.070
 we had the mass 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.150
 in the refrigerator 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:27.049
 let's go over a baking paper 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.049
 or on a silicone plate 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.459
 we will remove the dough 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.329
 and we will put it to be able to stretch it with 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.329
 a roller we started to dominate 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.160
 when I apply I evicted myself to what 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.410
 let's do now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 short I'm going to use this holder 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.470
 pasta 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.069
 because it has a very beautiful shape and it is 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.319
 of which is 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.659
 we also have some in case you do not have 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.060
 it's rope for these with this one 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.209
 this one is very easy to find in the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.209
 market 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.360
 we go 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.310
 and now we do with the mold 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.270
 the excess back to the smooth 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.240
 and it will not work 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.570
 to the next because we are going to take advantage 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.570
 all 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.220
 with this mass that has left us 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.780
 we will do the same again 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.780
 we will stretch and cut them 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.260
 we already move it on the tin 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.260
 in a baking paper 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.130
 we have prepared the oven 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.240
 180 degrees above and below 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.240
 we passed our cookies here 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.259
 and make a few dots on top of the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.690
 you can do it round if you do not have 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.690
 this gadget with a fork 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.889
 i 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.909
 we had our cookies 20 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.909
 minutes inside the oven 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.159
 fantastic 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.300
 of those who wonder 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.679
 here we have the result of our 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.349
 cookies as always friends I hope and 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:21.649
 I wish that if you make these succulents 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.649
 cookies are as good as you are 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.660
 i 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.630
 do not
