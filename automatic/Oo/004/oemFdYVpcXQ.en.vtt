00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 so hello to everyone today review 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 one interesting knife title 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.660
 expensive its cost about 5 10 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.640
 dollars and this is a knife smith and wesson fi 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 fay for the knife is very interesting on y tube 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.100
 I have not seen the full reviews of this knife 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.210
 so I decided to write my own as you see 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.470
 here we have and flipper for 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 opening and here is such a peg and here 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 so small 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 wave for opening for a pocket let's 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.660
 look at our unfolded form of us 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 walks pretty tight though i took it apart 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 looked at the puck smeared but all 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 itâ€™s still pretty tight 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.149
 blade here from 440 steel and grip from 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.270
 Aluminum also has such a clip 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 labeled with the logo of the cream in with 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 sour cream dream how do you know produces 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.299
 gun and all sorts of revolver and also 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 such small knives and five 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.490
 how would you mean the fireman but 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.820
 I do not know who will use this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.979
 a knife 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 only if these weird firemen are like that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.409
 that this knife is just such a toy 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 It is very convenient to play around for the collection 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.579
 done this weiss ich will 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 when you open grinko they are fine 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.250
 suitable as finger stops for example 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.980
 on cold steel ti-lite to me too 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.070
 did a review there everything is wrong there 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.230
 wave does not give you a finger in front of him 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.840
 here so it's not very comfortable here already 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.970
 everything is thought out for such a knife 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 for such money everything is amazing 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 thought out but I can say what to open 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.420
 not very comfortable behind you need to do 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.850
 here is a circular motion peg walks 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.760
 here here here around here or here I am the frame 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.350
 this circle clap and snap on the lock 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.850
 lock here liner lock 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.010
 as you can see the usual nothing special knife 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.390
 now stands in the center but I myself 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.240
 adjusted it because it parsed it and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.300
 greased pucks stood there two such 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.710
 thick fluoroplastic washers 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 terrible so fat with fat yes 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.320
 poorly processed well I have a little bit of them 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
 I have processed the blade, I will drag a little 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.380
 because factory sharpening was just 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.280
 horror now he's already somehow where is our focus 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.190
 somehow cut the paper well before that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.690
 he cut it but with great difficulty knives 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.860
 also come in with serial here and even 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:08.390
 called svf and as far as I remember 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.280
 svfs which means trader well from 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.350
 the cost of the finite is small so 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.120
 can you buy somehow indulge 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.880
 play here hand me. we are attached 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.650
 on 3 screws and plus axial also with us 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.510
 there is a lanyard hole 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.610
 lanyard hole is located very 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.690
 not bad 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.520
 I like such arrangements 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.440
 holes that is, we push 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.830
 lanyard just in the middle of the handle 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.870
 very convenient in my opinion clip clip 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.440
 don't like it very much because look well 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.160
 why here is such a piece is not very 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.620
 clearly mounted on 3 screws and nowhere 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.680
 it doesn't seem very strange 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.890
 because how do we see a knife 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.420
 equipped and you have our network 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.660
 he needs 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.060
 like this in your pocket but the amount is only 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.890
 here and nowhere not rearranged therefore 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.440
 this very strange knife here sits in 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.190
 in our pocket and how we will 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.709
 open 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.959
 using you don't understand it better he 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.739
 would sit like that lip would be here to him 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.150
 it was just not thought out I think this moment 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.370
 It was very easy days to drill holes 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.410
 did not think out for the fin yet 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.220
 opens quite tight but I think our 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.680
 so I think itâ€™s developed here 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.330
 still worth the money and you can afford 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.100
 allow such a toy adult toy 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.210
 everybody can afford to buy one 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.290
 knife and in the end I want to show the handle on 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.270
 my knife bag 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:52.970
 i did so here she is a paracord pen 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.310
 from the inside 2 bonnet chord 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.229
 that is, very convenient to take your bag 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.100
 for knives 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.440
 carry where you need video about the bag 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.410
 there is on my channel a little bit earlier 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.289
 video come see wait in 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.350
 comments thanks for watching everyone 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.350
 until
