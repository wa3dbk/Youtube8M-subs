00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.220
 sascha firm bix sam to galaxy s 4 in 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.690
 the exynos variant maybe you can 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.790
 some of you still remember these 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.809
 mysterious cracks in the samsung 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.289
 galaxy s3 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.910
 That was easy remember last year 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.289
 the device is seen the next morning 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.660
 again not dropped and 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.380
 suddenly there was this year on the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.840
 display 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.789
 That was because it was so simple 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.859
 the glass and the voltage was installed 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.170
 Now there is something going on with my samsung galaxy 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.670
 s 4 happens which is a bit similar 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.109
 First, I'll see if he's here 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.050
 believe me here at the side 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.420
 is a smaller one but watch out 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.359
 mean the device anmache then you see 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.940
 no matter what happens here I make time 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.999
 what to add as all in im please 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.079
 faster than the year could be 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:56.749
 Seeing that was a great time amoled 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.760
 display and you see that looks like 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.129
 kind of a crazy android 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.289
 with magix screen saver it is not 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.120

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.430
 so people called this morning 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.290
 I could not accept that anymore but 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.520
 As I said, there is not more here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920
 not to use 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.900
 I do not know if it's just like that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 now phenomenon of the formal device or 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.620
 any other user already this one 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.660
 experience made but in time 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.190
 The whole thing around me I have 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.970
 Do not drop it 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.890

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.690

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.440

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.970
