00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
then we pretty much have the unit itself

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.690 
then we pretty much have the unit itself
so<00:02:13.220> let's<00:02:13.489> go<00:02:13.610> ahead<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.060> take<00:02:14.330> our<00:02:15.280> iPad<00:02:16.280> air

so let's go ahead and take our iPad air

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
so let's go ahead and take our iPad air
and<00:02:17.209> slide<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:19.510> pretty<00:02:20.510> easy<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.319> that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and slide it in pretty easy to do that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.119 
and slide it in pretty easy to do that
there<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.769> go

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
there we go

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.540 
there we go
and<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:23.300> locks<00:02:23.599> into<00:02:23.900> place<00:02:24.080> with<00:02:24.890> these<00:02:25.069> side

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
and it locks into place with these side

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
and it locks into place with these side
mounts<00:02:25.940> onto<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.300> side<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.590> once

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
mounts onto the side of it and then once

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.850 
mounts onto the side of it and then once
you<00:02:27.860> do<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:29.000> got<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.300> closed<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:30.230> away

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
you do that you got it closed in away

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.160 
you do that you got it closed in away
you<00:02:30.920> go<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.910> take<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.269> adjust<00:02:33.050> it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
you go so you can take and adjust it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.290 
you go so you can take and adjust it
that<00:02:33.349> way<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:34.430> there's<00:02:34.760> two<00:02:34.790> ways<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.060> can

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
that way so now there's two ways you can

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.120 
that way so now there's two ways you can
have<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:35.930> laid<00:02:36.500> down<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:36.950> this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
have it you can have laid down like this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.559 
have it you can have laid down like this
so<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.459> have<00:02:37.700> an<00:02:37.819> inner<00:02:38.060> mode<00:02:38.269> where<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.540> can

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
so you have an inner mode where you can

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.720 
so you have an inner mode where you can
type<00:02:38.989> fairly<00:02:39.620> easy<00:02:39.799> or<00:02:40.099> you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.250> have<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.670> up

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
type fairly easy or you can have it up

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.430 
type fairly easy or you can have it up
like<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.750> kind<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.930> adjust<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.379> to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
like this you can kind of adjust it to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.930 
like this you can kind of adjust it to
several<00:02:42.709> different<00:02:42.830> places<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.519> balance

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
several different places that balance

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.030 
several different places that balance
out<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.750> felt<00:02:45.019> seems<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.530> give<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:45.890> lot<00:02:46.010> of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
out the felt seems to give it a lot of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190 
out the felt seems to give it a lot of
support<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:47.450> able<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.690> make<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.140> you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
support and be able to make it so you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.930 
support and be able to make it so you
can<00:02:48.349> see<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:49.069> do<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> want<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.489> take<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.790> do
