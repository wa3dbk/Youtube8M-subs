00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
now my my speedometer will be correct

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.639 
now my my speedometer will be correct
and<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> same<00:00:45.059> ipm<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> should<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and at the same ipm I should get about a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.920 
and at the same ipm I should get about a
couple<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> miles<00:00:47.520> per<00:00:47.820> hour<00:00:47.969> extra<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
couple of miles per hour extra at the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.310 
couple of miles per hour extra at the
same<00:00:49.110> rpm<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.610> fuel<00:00:50.879> mileage<00:00:51.059> might<00:00:51.719> even

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
same rpm so the fuel mileage might even

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.010

improve<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> same<00:00:54.449> place<00:00:54.480> where

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the look should change for the better

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.590 
the look should change for the better
and<00:01:48.780> I'll<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> stability<00:01:50.700> probably

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and I'll see how the stability probably

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330 
and I'll see how the stability probably
with<00:01:51.720> stability<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.740> improve<00:01:53.070> too

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
with stability will will improve too

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060 
with stability will will improve too
because<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> wider<00:01:54.659> tire<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.380> should

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
because this is a wider tire so should

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.560 
because this is a wider tire so should
be<00:01:56.100> great<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> weather<00:01:57.240> you
