which happens over throughout the day
and<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.810> said<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.470> at<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
and so like I said with that at the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.380 
and so like I said with that at the
water<00:02:15.310> level<00:02:15.520> sitting<00:02:15.970> still<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.330> only

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
water level sitting still it's only

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.080 
water level sitting still it's only
gonna<00:02:16.630> drink<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.930> half<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.110> gallon<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.090> when

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
gonna drink a half a gallon now but when

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.440 
gonna drink a half a gallon now but when
I<00:02:19.180> take<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.350> tilt<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.860> into<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> water

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
I take this and I tilt it into the water

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.290 
I take this and I tilt it into the water
as<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.959> those<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.260> submerged<00:02:23.709> now

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
as you can see those are submerged now

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.250 
as you can see those are submerged now
what<00:02:25.300> happens<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.650> flow<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.459> overflow

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
what happens is the flow in the overflow

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.040 
what happens is the flow in the overflow
increases<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.470> basically<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.420> maximum<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
increases to basically a maximum you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.479 
increases to basically a maximum you
know<00:02:32.080> speed<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:32.890> thing<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> flow<00:02:33.459> out

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
know speed that this thing can flow out

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.100 
know speed that this thing can flow out
what<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.630> does

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
what that does

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.910 
what that does
pushes<00:02:35.560> any<00:02:35.950> bubbles<00:02:36.489> anything<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.270> right

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
pushes any bubbles anything out right

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040 
pushes any bubbles anything out right
through<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.010> overflow<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.730> nap<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.840> don't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
through that overflow a nap so I don't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.780 
through that overflow a nap so I don't
have<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> worry<00:02:41.530> about<00:02:41.650> bubbles<00:02:42.310> building<00:02:42.670> up

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
have to worry about bubbles building up

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.690 
have to worry about bubbles building up
over<00:02:42.910> time<00:02:43.709> same<00:02:44.709> thing<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.190> one<00:02:45.250> see

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
over time same thing with this one see

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.110 
over time same thing with this one see
if<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.060> probably<00:02:46.930> can't<00:02:47.260> see<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.120> all

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
if we can probably can't see it but all

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.770 
if we can probably can't see it but all
I<00:02:49.150> do<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.660> tilt<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.260> down<00:02:51.510> which<00:02:52.510> allows

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
I do is just tilt that down which allows

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.949 
I do is just tilt that down which allows
much<00:02:53.200> more<00:02:53.230> water<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.950> come<00:02:54.160> through<00:02:54.570> which<00:02:55.570> in

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
much more water to come through which in

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.590 
much more water to come through which in
every<00:02:56.920> single<00:02:57.160> instance<00:02:57.730> I've<00:02:58.000> tried<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.540> with

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
every single instance I've tried it with

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.870 
every single instance I've tried it with
the<00:02:58.780> bubble<00:02:59.110> pushes<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.100> bubble<00:03:00.430> directly

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
the bubble pushes that bubble directly

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.150 
the bubble pushes that bubble directly
through<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> overflow<00:03:01.620> never<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.799> be<00:03:02.920> worried

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
through the overflow never to be worried

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.190 
through the overflow never to be worried
about<00:03:03.190> again<00:03:03.580> okay<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:05.019> my

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
about again okay so I do this about my

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.880 
about again okay so I do this about my
checking<00:03:05.500> about<00:03:05.739> once<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.070> day<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:07.570> know<00:03:07.890> it's

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
checking about once a day you know it's

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.539 
checking about once a day you know it's
not<00:03:09.480> 100<00:03:10.480> percent<00:03:10.810> way<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.959> figure<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.380> out<00:03:11.590> or

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
not 100 percent way to figure it out or

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.360 
not 100 percent way to figure it out or
to<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.330> mean<00:03:13.830> if<00:03:14.830> you're<00:03:14.950> gonna<00:03:15.100> set

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
to do it but I mean if you're gonna set

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.860 
to do it but I mean if you're gonna set
up<00:03:15.489> an<00:03:15.580> overflow<00:03:16.000> system<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.690> with

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
up an overflow system like this with

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.050 
up an overflow system like this with
your<00:03:17.019> drip<00:03:17.200> system<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.489> definitely<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
your drip system this is definitely a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.120 
your drip system this is definitely a
way<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.540> I've<00:03:19.630> found<00:03:19.660> that<00:03:20.200> completely

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
way that I've found that completely

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.080 
way that I've found that completely
eliminates<00:03:21.730> bubbles<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.900> my<00:03:23.079> system<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
eliminates bubbles in my system and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.089 
eliminates bubbles in my system and
I've<00:03:25.360> only<00:03:25.690> had<00:03:25.989> issue<00:03:26.230> when<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.739> comes<00:03:26.920> to

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
I've only had issue when it comes to

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.640 
I've only had issue when it comes to
bubbles<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.569> tanks<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.200> run<00:03:29.380> lower

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
bubbles on the tanks that I run lower

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.550 
bubbles on the tanks that I run lower
drip<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:31.420> these<00:03:31.660> four<00:03:31.989> tanks<00:03:32.349> that<00:03:32.440> I

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
drip on like these four tanks that I

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.760 
drip on like these four tanks that I
have<00:03:32.709> dripping<00:03:33.190> um<00:03:33.819> all<00:03:34.480> are<00:03:34.750> dripping<00:03:35.080> at<00:03:35.170> 0.5

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
have dripping um all are dripping at 0.5

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
have dripping um all are dripping at 0.5
gallons<00:03:36.280> per<00:03:36.430> hour<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.650> these<00:03:39.489> are<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
gallons per hour so and these are the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.199 
gallons per hour so and these are the
only<00:03:39.910> things<00:03:40.120> I've<00:03:40.330> had<00:03:40.480> bubbles<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:42.209> check

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
only things I've had bubbles in check

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.940 
only things I've had bubbles in check
out<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.690> overflow<00:03:44.230> right<00:03:44.380> there<00:03:44.680> I've<00:03:44.800> got

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
out that overflow right there I've got

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.530 
out that overflow right there I've got
this<00:03:45.130> thang<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.670> thing<00:03:45.910> hooked<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.420> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
this thang this thing hooked up to the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.620 
this thang this thing hooked up to the
same<00:03:46.750> song<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:48.220> one's<00:03:48.280> dripping<00:03:48.940> at<00:03:49.180> two

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
same song and this one's dripping at two

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.080 
same song and this one's dripping at two
gallons<00:03:50.110> per<00:03:50.319> hour<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.370> seems<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
gallons per hour and it seems that the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.570 
gallons per hour and it seems that the
speed<00:03:52.569> in<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.380> one<00:03:53.590> drains<00:03:56.580> basically

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
speed in which that one drains basically

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.990 
speed in which that one drains basically
eliminates<00:03:58.060> any<00:03:58.209> bubbles<00:03:59.459> yeah<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.790> hear

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
eliminates any bubbles yeah you can hear

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.050 
eliminates any bubbles yeah you can hear
it<00:04:01.180> gurgles<00:04:01.600> like<00:04:01.870> an<00:04:02.019> overflow<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.819> sump

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
it gurgles like an overflow in a sump

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.690 
it gurgles like an overflow in a sump
just<00:04:04.299> much<00:04:04.450> quieter<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.500> haven't<00:04:06.010> had<00:04:06.190> zero

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
just much quieter but haven't had zero

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.820 
just much quieter but haven't had zero
zero<00:04:07.209> issues<00:04:07.450> as<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.680> thing's

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
zero issues as you can see that thing's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.620 
zero issues as you can see that thing's
taped<00:04:09.130> on<00:04:09.310> there<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.700> taped<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
taped on there I taped that on to the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.000 
taped on there I taped that on to the
first<00:04:10.840> time<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:11.140> put<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.410> on<00:04:11.560> there<00:04:11.590> have<00:04:11.860> not

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
first time I put that on there have not

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.470 
first time I put that on there have not
had<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.340> deal<00:04:12.549> with<00:04:12.580> one<00:04:12.880> since<00:04:13.180> been<00:04:13.360> on

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
had to deal with one since been on

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.569 
had to deal with one since been on
record<00:04:14.519> over<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> month<00:04:15.819> now<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:17.130> how<00:04:18.130> your<00:04:18.310> drip

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
record over a month now so how your drip

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.580 
record over a month now so how your drip
probably<00:04:19.450> don't<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.870> worry<00:04:20.049> about<00:04:20.169> level

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
probably don't have to worry about level

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.040 
probably don't have to worry about level
so<00:04:20.739> much<00:04:20.950> lower<00:04:21.669> drip<00:04:22.030> on<00:04:22.180> small<00:04:22.510> tanks<00:04:22.960> you're

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
so much lower drip on small tanks you're

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.180 
so much lower drip on small tanks you're
probably<00:04:23.260> gonna<00:04:23.470> have<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.710> little<00:04:23.919> bit<00:04:24.100> of

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
probably gonna have a little bit of

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.100 
probably gonna have a little bit of
issue<00:04:24.310> with<00:04:24.430> all<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:24.790> especially<00:04:25.030> as<00:04:25.870> I've

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
issue with all this especially as I've

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.920 
issue with all this especially as I've
heard<00:04:26.290> with<00:04:26.470> dissolved<00:04:26.919> oxygen<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:28.090> tanks

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
heard with dissolved oxygen in tanks

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.860 
heard with dissolved oxygen in tanks
that<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.080> run<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:30.240> sponge<00:04:31.240> filter<00:04:31.390> strips

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
that you run a sponge filter strips

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.390 
that you run a sponge filter strips
these<00:04:32.050> two<00:04:32.260> tanks<00:04:32.470> are<00:04:32.680> both<00:04:32.800> on<00:04:33.010> those<00:04:33.160> phones

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
these two tanks are both on those phones

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.140 
these two tanks are both on those phones
won't<00:04:33.610> work<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:35.320> yeah<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:36.580> seems<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.030> have

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
won't work but yeah this seems to have

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.370 
won't work but yeah this seems to have
worked<00:04:37.390> for<00:04:37.630> me<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:39.690> help<00:04:40.690> with<00:04:40.750> problem<00:04:41.260> with

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
worked for me to help with problem with

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.710 
worked for me to help with problem with
bubbles<00:04:41.770> in<00:04:42.039> my<00:04:42.640> overflow<00:04:43.150> haven't<00:04:43.510> had<00:04:43.630> an

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
bubbles in my overflow haven't had an

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.909 
bubbles in my overflow haven't had an
overflow<00:04:43.990> lately

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
overflow lately

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:52.950 
overflow lately
I<00:04:44.950> also<00:04:47.220> took<00:04:48.900> my<00:04:50.729> my<00:04:51.729> overflow<00:04:52.300> tube<00:04:52.570> and

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
I also took my my overflow tube and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.900 
I also took my my overflow tube and
instead<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.410> cutting<00:04:53.680> them<00:04:53.950> at<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.130> 90<00:04:54.580> degree

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
instead of cutting them at a 90 degree

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.420 
instead of cutting them at a 90 degree
angle<00:04:54.940> straight<00:04:55.660> down<00:04:56.039> because<00:04:57.039> with<00:04:57.220> this

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
angle straight down because with this

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.300 
angle straight down because with this
one<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.760> clogged<00:04:58.060> up<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.630> did<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.830> hook<00:05:00.160> at

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
one it clogged up what I did is hook at

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.890 
one it clogged up what I did is hook at
the<00:05:00.400> bottom

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the bottom

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.640 
the bottom
let's<00:05:02.230> find<00:05:02.530> something<00:05:02.800> here<00:05:07.290> so<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.380> got<00:05:08.530> the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
let's find something here so you got the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.930 
let's find something here so you got the
bottom<00:05:08.920> of<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.070> tube<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.580> here

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
bottom of the tube in here

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.180 
bottom of the tube in here
what<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.240> did<00:05:10.570> is<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.870> cut<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.200> probably<00:05:11.620> like<00:05:11.770> an

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
what I did is I cut it probably like an

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.180 
what I did is I cut it probably like an
angle<00:05:12.580> like<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:14.200> that<00:05:14.380> water<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:15.010> enter

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
angle like that so that water can enter

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.800 
angle like that so that water can enter
throughout<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.850> whole<00:05:16.000> thing<00:05:16.300> instead<00:05:16.660> of

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
throughout the whole thing instead of

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.680 
throughout the whole thing instead of
just<00:05:17.140> one<00:05:17.350> spot<00:05:17.710> on<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.890> bottom<00:05:18.150> which<00:05:19.150> seems

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
just one spot on the bottom which seems

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.160 
just one spot on the bottom which seems
to<00:05:19.780> have<00:05:19.990> worked<00:05:21.450> but<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:22.690> noticed<00:05:22.900> that

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
to have worked but I have noticed that

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.410 
to have worked but I have noticed that
there<00:05:23.440> is<00:05:23.500> like<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.890> buildup<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.520> algae<00:05:25.030> inside

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
there is like a buildup of algae inside

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.530 
there is like a buildup of algae inside
of<00:05:25.630> these<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.520> will<00:05:28.060> have<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.330> do

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
of these that I will have to do

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.420 
of these that I will have to do
maintenance<00:05:29.260> on<00:05:29.560> every<00:05:29.830> once<00:05:30.010> in<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.160> while<00:05:30.190> you

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
maintenance on every once in a while you

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.550 
maintenance on every once in a while you
can<00:05:30.550> see<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.880> line<00:05:31.090> right<00:05:31.120> there<00:05:31.510> so<00:05:31.750> that's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
can see the line right there so that's

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.830 
can see the line right there so that's
some<00:05:32.770> buildup<00:05:33.130> in<00:05:33.310> there<00:05:33.490> so<00:05:34.360> far<00:05:34.600> I<00:05:34.660> haven't

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
some buildup in there so far I haven't

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.440 
some buildup in there so far I haven't
had<00:05:34.990> any<00:05:35.260> issues<00:05:35.380> with<00:05:35.710> that<00:05:35.740> other<00:05:36.130> than<00:05:36.450> when

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
had any issues with that other than when

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.020 
had any issues with that other than when
this<00:05:37.600> one<00:05:37.780> overflowed<00:05:38.320> back<00:05:38.590> there

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
this one overflowed back there

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.000 
this one overflowed back there
so<00:05:40.030> yeah<00:05:41.400> don't<00:05:42.400> tip<00:05:42.670> on<00:05:43.420> your<00:05:43.840> overflow<00:05:44.200> you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
so yeah don't tip on your overflow you

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.190 
so yeah don't tip on your overflow you
got<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:45.160> bubble<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.610> there<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.450> don't<00:05:47.080> have

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
got a bubble in there and you don't have

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.310 
got a bubble in there and you don't have
this<00:05:47.380> thing<00:05:47.620> 100%<00:05:48.460> fixed<00:05:48.910> just<00:05:49.750> tilt<00:05:50.140> it<00:05:50.260> down

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
this thing 100% fixed just tilt it down

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800 
this thing 100% fixed just tilt it down
below<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.920> waterline<00:05:51.250> which<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:52.330> gonna<00:05:52.450> allow

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
below the waterline which is gonna allow

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.830 
below the waterline which is gonna allow
much<00:05:53.290> more<00:05:53.470> water<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.860> flow<00:05:54.100> through<00:05:54.130> and<00:05:54.910> for

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
much more water to flow through and for

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.680 
much more water to flow through and for
me<00:05:55.960> that's<00:05:56.140> really<00:05:56.590> really<00:05:57.040> worked<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.760> push

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
me that's really really worked to push

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.380 
me that's really really worked to push
anything<00:05:58.990> through<00:05:59.460> your<00:06:00.460> overflow<00:06:00.880> I<00:06:00.970> do<00:06:01.120> this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
anything through your overflow I do this

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.620 
anything through your overflow I do this
probably<00:06:01.690> once<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:02.020> day<00:06:02.170> on<00:06:02.410> on<00:06:02.800> these<00:06:03.460> three<00:06:03.820> or

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
probably once a day on on these three or

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.460 
probably once a day on on these three or
these<00:06:05.110> four<00:06:05.500> overflows<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.640> it<00:06:06.730> works<00:06:06.880> great

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
these four overflows and it works great

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.890 
these four overflows and it works great
