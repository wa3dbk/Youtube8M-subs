00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
how it's going to fit in here you see

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.500 
how it's going to fit in here you see
this<00:03:20.710> a<00:03:20.890> pillar<00:03:21.160> over<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.700> where<00:03:22.330> we've<00:03:22.480> just

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
this a pillar over here where we've just

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.020 
this a pillar over here where we've just
cut<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.200> hole<00:03:23.470> enough<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.130> allow<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> MCD

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
cut the hole enough to allow the MCD

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.970 
cut the hole enough to allow the MCD
shade<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.510> there<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.410> way<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.770> when<00:03:26.890> we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
shade in there and the way that when we

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.010 
shade in there and the way that when we
did<00:03:27.130> our<00:03:27.190> measurement<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.330> shade<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.660> going

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
did our measurement that shade is going

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.080 
did our measurement that shade is going
to<00:03:29.080> just<00:03:29.320> roll<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.980> fall<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.880> roll

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
to just roll and fall and just roll

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.450 
to just roll and fall and just roll
right<00:03:31.300> down<00:03:31.360> this<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.470> pillar<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:32.980> follow

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
right down this a pillar and follow

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.800 
right down this a pillar and follow
along<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.000> won't<00:03:34.210> have<00:03:34.300> any<00:03:34.360> daylight

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
along so you won't have any daylight

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.040 
along so you won't have any daylight
come<00:03:35.080> through<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.520> this<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> process<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
come through so this is the process and

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.650 
come through so this is the process and
we're<00:03:38.770> right<00:03:39.010> now<00:03:39.040> with<00:03:39.490> it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
we're right now with it
