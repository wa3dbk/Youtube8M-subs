00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.700
 the circle piston wankel engine the common 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.430
 also just called wankelmotor 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 was created by Felix Wankel in the 1950's 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.060
 he years ago developed in contrast to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 reciprocating engine which one up and 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 Movement of the piston in one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.030
 rotatory motion is the wankel 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.100
 engine that is released during combustion 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.660
 the energy directly into a rotary motion 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.059
 over the wankelmotor exists first 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 from a triangular rotation piston 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.530
 the runner is called and his 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 has three corners tightly afford 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 The runner has an internal toothing 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 in a puzzle with external teeth 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.120
 The puzzle is at the back 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.940
 fixed on the housing and has the task 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 to guide the piston inside the cave 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.309
 in this oval-shaped figure the form 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 a so-called troppo ide has 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 are taken in from above spark plugs and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.610
 she has an inlet and a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.610
 outlet slit 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.619
 the runner transfers the resulting 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.990
 Movement through the combustion to one 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.590
 excel table the corresponding the wheels 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.570
 drives as you see here missing many 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 parts of the reciprocating engine like 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.770
 For example, the connecting rod and the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.399
 valves causing the wankelmotor in the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.930
 usually a very compact design allowed 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.810
 Let us now look at the way it works 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.920
 of the wankel engine at the wankel engine 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.350
 an internal combustion engine 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.149
 who works on the 4-stroke principle 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.280
 these four clocks arrive 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:47.590
 different places take place and should 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 now be lit in succession 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.060
 The piston rotation is in the first stroke 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.770
 the fuel air mixture which here 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.440
 to see in the right part of the animation 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.149
 is said in the camera by the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.159
 further rotation of the piston is in the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.429
 second day this mix finally 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.539
 compressed in the upper part of the chamber 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.369
 when the mix finally his 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.350
 highest density achieved and the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.119
 spark plugs it has happened in the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.100
 third day through the spark plugs 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.989
 ignited by the burning of the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.209
 mixed it comes to a pressure 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.820
 increase the piston drives 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.700
 in the fourth act, the exhaust gases are through 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.500
 the outlet from the chamber carries the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.870
 four clocks will be from each of the three 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.030
 runners run through that means 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.320
 that during a runner turn three 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.320
 ignitions take place
