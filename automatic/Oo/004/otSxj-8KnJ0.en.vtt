00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.309
 yes, I have always been in a team 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.889
 Spanish is the first time there is a 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.480
 foreign team at the beginning was a 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.790
 little worried about the issue of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 communication with the technician with 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.060
 mechanics with the equipment in general but 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.890
 little by little and angels I saw that I 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.510
 has entertained quite well if I had 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.369
 some problem they solved me if 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.039
 some that are more others less but 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.619
 we always end up going better so 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.930
 I am very happy with how I communicate 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.629
 like in the team how are we 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.590
 evolving how we do many things 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.690
 and happy for the change 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 well this this winter we have 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 done a little bit of all a lot of work and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.380
 a lot of fun is also important 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.950
 we have made bike running gym 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.560
 motocross 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.750
 dirt track 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.550
 of all a little speed bike 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.170
 even some car race can 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.000
 to have had the good fortune to be able to do 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.110
 so it's been a very preseason 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 intense 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 he will say that it is very funny about all 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.800
 the races going back this year in the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 superprestigio 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.080
 we did a great race after 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 Funny fun because they are loads 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.700
 very explosive races where you have to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.580
 leave and you can not breathe until the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.270
 final are short but very intense today 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.280
 so it was really fun 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.770
 in part with a career where there was 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.350
 a lot of people could not see it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 and really had a good time and it was like 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.420
 a training session of situations 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.270
 that you live here in career in the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 global especially the departures 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.970
 yes yes since I'm 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.440
 well I feel strong for this 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.270
 season but you have to take into account 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.160
 that these moto2 there are many pilots 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.440
 good many pilots who carry young 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.460
 many experienced pilots a lot 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.530
 variety and good driver and motorcycles 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.340
 all are the same all over the world 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.080
 same engine 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.110
 the same suspensions the same 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.819
 wheels of the same weight then the only thing 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 what changes is the chassis but the three 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.940
 also majority taxis that are kalex 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.810
 suter hospital because they are all 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.959
 competitive because they are all 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.549
 competitive and communication and the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.140
 pilot and the team know how to fine-tune 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.790
 the bike that this is where I think it 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.790
 makes the difference in this category 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.019
 but good in general I feel more 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.500
 strong that I never really want to 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.500
 start now 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.360
 also eager to start the test 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.159
 no it's no pressure really the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.760
 last year I made mistakes but they were 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.739
 more casual because here in Australia I 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.730
 I left I also fell in mans and not 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.780
 I had any kind of pressure 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.730
 in Japan it was a race 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.709
 a complicated weekend because no 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 we can shoot then we go blind 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.700
 In race 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.620
 and I fell because there were also many 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.090
 pilots out there was a situation 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 strange 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.480
 but good more pressure than I do 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.560
 I put I want to win and have fun is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.060
 important but also win 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.060
 the two are very important 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.840
 more pressure than me a little not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.870
 I think they put me, they can not put me 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 really so let's go out to 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.870
 enjoy 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.970
 to fight to win each race that each 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.960
 career 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:52.080
 Well there are many drivers not to 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.080
 kallio light and towers terol to me 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.049
 vineyards that climbs with great force that 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 he really wants pilots 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.510
 experienced young pilots there are many 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.099
 variety of this so pilots that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.439
 they will surprise you so you never have to 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.680
 lower your guard and there you have to be 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.959
 every day working to the fullest to 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.069
 to have a regularity forward for 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.069
 fight to fight the championship
