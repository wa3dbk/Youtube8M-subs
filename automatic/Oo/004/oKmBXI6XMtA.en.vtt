of the rows here the whole Rose has been
knocked<00:00:43.690> over<00:00:43.870> this<00:00:44.350> way<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.829> it's<00:00:44.950> fact

knocked over this way and it's fact
pointing<00:00:45.579> off<00:00:45.700> in<00:00:45.880> this<00:00:45.970> direction<00:00:46.030> it's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
then go ahead and put a stake in or

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.360 
then go ahead and put a stake in or
something<00:00:55.899> to<00:00:56.050> support<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.680> for<00:00:56.860> just<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.160> while

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370

something to support it for just a while
while<00:00:57.670> these<00:00:57.820> roots<00:00:58.090> regenerate<00:00:58.750> because

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
while these roots regenerate because

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.020 
while these roots regenerate because
like<00:00:59.260> tops<00:00:59.559> when<00:00:59.860> you<00:00:59.950> cut<00:01:00.160> them<00:01:00.370> roots<00:01:00.850> when

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
like tops when you cut them roots when

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.490 
like tops when you cut them roots when
you<00:01:01.120> cut<00:01:01.300> them<00:01:01.480> regenerate<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.170> grow<00:01:02.320> new

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
you cut them regenerate and grow new

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.320

a very loose tie by the way it's nothing

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.830 
a very loose tie by the way it's nothing
very<00:01:53.740> firm<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.060> want<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.299> support<00:01:55.659> it

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
very firm here I just want to support it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.880 
very firm here I just want to support it
I<00:01:55.900> don't<00:01:56.020> really<00:01:56.110> want<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.380> tie<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.710> like<00:01:56.860> a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
I don't really want to tie it in like a

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.100 
I don't really want to tie it in like a
climber<00:01:57.250> I've<00:01:57.850> mounted<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.360> extra<00:01:58.659> soil<00:01:58.900> up

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
climber I've mounted the extra soil up

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.420 
climber I've mounted the extra soil up
around<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.500> base<00:01:59.710> I'm<00:01:59.920> even<00:02:00.100> going<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.280> add<00:02:00.400> a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
around the base I'm even going to add a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.950 
around the base I'm even going to add a
layer<00:02:00.670> mulch<00:02:01.090> or<00:02:01.270> something<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.780> give<00:02:01.930> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
layer mulch or something just to give it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.149 
layer mulch or something just to give it
a<00:02:02.079> little<00:02:02.170> extra<00:02:02.320> protection<00:02:02.560> from<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
a little extra protection from the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.429 
a little extra protection from the
elements<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.810> next<00:02:04.990> thing<00:02:05.200> we're<00:02:05.409> going

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
elements now the next thing we're going

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.020 
elements now the next thing we're going
to<00:02:05.560> really<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.189> wait<00:02:06.400> basically

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
to really do is just wait basically

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.609 
to really do is just wait basically
because<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.540> rose<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:07.990> has<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.290> sort<00:02:08.470> itself

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
because this rose now has to sort itself

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.530 
because this rose now has to sort itself
out<00:02:08.890> over<00:02:08.950> time<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.579> can't<00:02:09.910> hurry<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.329> I<00:02:10.420> can

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
out over time I can't hurry it I can

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.330 
out over time I can't hurry it I can
give<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.750> some<00:02:10.899> root<00:02:11.079> tone<00:02:11.320> or<00:02:11.560> some<00:02:11.709> roots

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
give it some root tone or some roots

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.130 
give it some root tone or some roots
type<00:02:12.730> fertilizers<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.540> push<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.870> along<00:02:13.959> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
type fertilizers to push it along a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.810 
type fertilizers to push it along a
little<00:02:14.290> bit<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.100> that's<00:02:15.220> all<00:02:15.430> I'm<00:02:15.549> not<00:02:15.670> going

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
little bit but that's all I'm not going

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.520 
little bit but that's all I'm not going
to<00:02:15.880> worry<00:02:16.030> about<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.480> periodically<00:02:17.350> I'll

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
to worry about that periodically I'll

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.080 
to worry about that periodically I'll
loosen<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> tie<00:02:18.190> see<00:02:18.489> if<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.700> roads<00:02:18.880> can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
loosen the tie see if the roads can

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.640 
loosen the tie see if the roads can
stand<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.390> its<00:02:19.570> own<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.840> i<00:02:19.900> respected<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> take

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
stand on its own but i respected to take

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.229 
stand on its own but i respected to take
even<00:02:20.919> two<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.070> three<00:02:21.280> maybe<00:02:21.489> even<00:02:21.579> four<00:02:21.730> months

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
even two or three maybe even four months

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.340 
even two or three maybe even four months
i'm<00:02:22.389> not<00:02:22.570> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.720> worry<00:02:22.930> about<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.139> it'll

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
i'm not going to worry about it it'll

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.800 
i'm not going to worry about it it'll
take<00:02:23.590> care<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.829> itself

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
take care of itself

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
take care of itself
some<00:02:25.349> people<00:02:25.650> will<00:02:25.770> advocate<00:02:26.220> taking<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
some people will advocate taking the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.220 
some people will advocate taking the
rose<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.819> cutting<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.300> down<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
rose and cutting it down a little bit I

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.930 
rose and cutting it down a little bit I
don't<00:02:28.920> see<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.069> point<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.849> this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
don't see the point in that for this

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
don't see the point in that for this
because<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.510> rose<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.989> now<00:02:31.170> has<00:02:31.380> got

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
because this rose right now has got

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.920 
because this rose right now has got
healthy<00:02:31.890> growth<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.580> no<00:02:32.760> die<00:02:33.000> back<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.750> why

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
healthy growth I see no die back so why

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.660 
healthy growth I see no die back so why
take<00:02:34.170> away<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> food<00:02:34.800> source<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.310> needs<00:02:35.489> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
take away the food source it needs to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
take away the food source it needs to
make<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.940> new<00:02:36.090> routes<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.989> let<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
make the new routes I'm going to let the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.440 
make the new routes I'm going to let the
Rose<00:02:37.530> tell<00:02:37.920> me<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.310> wants<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.180> it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
Rose tell me what it wants to do if it

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.089 
Rose tell me what it wants to do if it
starts<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.780> die<00:02:40.020> back<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.560> I'll<00:02:40.680> cut<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.980> back

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
starts to die back then I'll cut it back

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.160 
starts to die back then I'll cut it back
a<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.360> rose<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:42.780> least<00:02:42.989> now

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
a little bit but this rose at least now

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660
