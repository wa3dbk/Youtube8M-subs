now I'm going to force the jack into

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.110 
now I'm going to force the jack into
position<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:57.100> you<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.370> power<00:00:57.850> light

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
position and there you go power light

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.819 
position and there you go power light
comes<00:00:58.359> right<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.690> or<00:00:59.079> charge<00:00:59.440> light<00:00:59.620> comes

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
comes right on or charge light comes

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.639 
comes right on or charge light comes
right<00:01:00.010> on<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:01.539> to<00:01:01.690> disassemble<00:01:02.469> this
