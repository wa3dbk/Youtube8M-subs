00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.860 

so<00:00:06.109> let's<00:00:06.260> walk<00:00:06.440> through<00:00:06.470> a<00:00:07.600> proper<00:00:08.600> setup

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
so let's walk through a proper setup

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.310 
so let's walk through a proper setup
with<00:00:09.200> this<00:00:09.440> camera<00:00:09.770> on<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.280> gimbal<00:00:11.200> one<00:00:12.200> of

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
with this camera on the gimbal one of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.140 
with this camera on the gimbal one of
the<00:00:12.379> most<00:00:12.559> important<00:00:13.039> things<00:00:13.309> when<00:00:14.030> you're

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
the most important things when you're

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.060 
the most important things when you're
working<00:00:14.330> with<00:00:15.199> a<00:00:15.260> gimbal<00:00:15.559> and<00:00:15.830> you're<00:00:15.920> trying

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
working with a gimbal and you're trying

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.310 
working with a gimbal and you're trying
to<00:00:16.219> gyro-stabilized<00:00:17.000> it<00:00:17.210> is<00:00:17.330> that<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.080> get

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
to gyro-stabilized it is that you get

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.710 
to gyro-stabilized it is that you get
the<00:00:18.619> CG<00:00:19.039> of<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.400> camera<00:00:19.760> absolutely<00:00:20.270> perfect

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the CG of the camera absolutely perfect

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.590 
the CG of the camera absolutely perfect
if<00:00:21.590> you<00:00:21.650> can<00:00:21.920> if<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:22.760> can<00:00:22.790> visualize<00:00:23.030> when

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
if you can if you can visualize when

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.200 
if you can if you can visualize when
this<00:00:23.720> role<00:00:24.080> servos<00:00:24.530> got<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.800> work<00:00:24.980> if<00:00:25.250> it's

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
this role servos got to work if it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.650 
this role servos got to work if it's
pre-loaded<00:00:27.020> one<00:00:27.200> way<00:00:27.380> or<00:00:27.560> another<00:00:28.480> if<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
pre-loaded one way or another if the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.690 
pre-loaded one way or another if the
camera<00:00:30.020> is<00:00:30.050> weighted<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.800> right<00:00:31.010> when<00:00:31.580> it

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
camera is weighted to the right when it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.950 
camera is weighted to the right when it
has<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.940> make<00:00:32.059> move<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.539> left<00:00:32.689> that's

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
has to make move to the left that's

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.389 
has to make move to the left that's
working<00:00:33.289> really<00:00:33.410> hard<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.800> do<00:00:33.949> that<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.309> then

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
working really hard to do that and then

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.880 
working really hard to do that and then
also<00:00:34.579> when<00:00:34.879> it's<00:00:35.059> moving<00:00:35.690> this<00:00:35.870> way<00:00:36.079> it's<00:00:36.680> got

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
also when it's moving this way it's got

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.560 
also when it's moving this way it's got
a<00:00:36.920> force<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.340> makes<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.790> whole<00:00:38.030> gimbal<00:00:38.390> want

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
a force that makes the whole gimbal want

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.569 
a force that makes the whole gimbal want
to<00:00:38.660> run<00:00:38.780> away<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:39.200> way<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.500> if<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.280> servo

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
to run away that way and if the servo

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.310 
to run away that way and if the servo
can't<00:00:40.820> quite<00:00:41.030> keep<00:00:41.239> up<00:00:41.450> or<00:00:41.720> can't<00:00:41.900> quite<00:00:42.170> do<00:00:42.290> it

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
can't quite keep up or can't quite do it

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.560 
can't quite keep up or can't quite do it
smoothly<00:00:42.710> enough<00:00:43.100> you'll<00:00:43.880> get<00:00:44.120> you'll<00:00:44.420> get

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
smoothly enough you'll get you'll get

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.060 
smoothly enough you'll get you'll get
like<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> stair<00:00:45.110> stepping<00:00:45.410> motion<00:00:45.890> which

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
like a stair stepping motion which

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.460 
like a stair stepping motion which
you'll<00:00:46.220> see<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.520> lot<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.700> people's<00:00:47.030> video

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
you'll see in a lot of people's video

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.660 
you'll see in a lot of people's video
and<00:00:48.470> usually<00:00:48.770> that's<00:00:48.860> from<00:00:49.130> a<00:00:49.160> poorly

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
and usually that's from a poorly

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.229 
and usually that's from a poorly
balanced<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:50.329> poorly<00:00:50.899> setup<00:00:51.290> gimbal<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:53.059> let's

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
balanced or poorly setup gimbal so let's

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.720 
balanced or poorly setup gimbal so let's
put<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.540> 5d<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.170> here<00:00:54.470> let's<00:00:54.950> get<00:00:55.130> a<00:00:55.190> balanced

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
put the 5d on here let's get a balanced

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.920 
put the 5d on here let's get a balanced
let's<00:00:56.090> get<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.360> set<00:00:56.540> up<00:00:58.510> I'm<00:00:59.510> just<00:00:59.690> going<00:00:59.870> to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
let's get it set up I'm just going to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.049 
let's get it set up I'm just going to
tighten<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.399> going<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:01.579> be<00:01:01.730> kind<00:01:01.910> of<00:01:01.969> a

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
tighten up this is going to be kind of a

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.620 
tighten up this is going to be kind of a
rough<00:01:02.270> rough<00:01:02.780> set<00:01:03.050> up<00:01:03.170> because<00:01:03.469> it<00:01:03.800> would<00:01:03.920> take

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
rough rough set up because it would take

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.370 
rough rough set up because it would take
kind<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.689> one<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:05.840> those<00:01:05.899> things<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:06.170> need<00:01:06.350> to

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
kind of one of those things you need to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440 
kind of one of those things you need to
just<00:01:06.619> take<00:01:06.799> some<00:01:07.340> time<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.909> sit<00:01:08.060> down<00:01:08.090> one

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
just take some time to sit down one

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.050 
just take some time to sit down one
night<00:01:08.569> and<00:01:08.810> do<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.859> you<00:01:10.399> know<00:01:10.429> in<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:10.670> patient

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
night and do and you know in a patient

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.639 
night and do and you know in a patient
mood<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.509> you<00:01:11.569> have<00:01:11.689> some<00:01:11.840> time<00:01:12.049> to<00:01:12.200> adjust<00:01:12.289> it

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
mood and you have some time to adjust it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.599 
mood and you have some time to adjust it
takes<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:12.889> little<00:01:13.009> bit<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.219> time<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.490> get

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
takes a little bit of time to get

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.370 
takes a little bit of time to get
everything<00:01:13.719> perfectly<00:01:14.719> set<00:01:14.899> up<00:01:14.929> but<00:01:15.109> once<00:01:15.259> you

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
everything perfectly set up but once you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.050 
everything perfectly set up but once you
do<00:01:15.530> unless<00:01:15.889> you're<00:01:16.039> swapping<00:01:16.280> cameras<00:01:16.819> really

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
do unless you're swapping cameras really

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.209 
do unless you're swapping cameras really
frequently<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:18.289> kind<00:01:18.469> of<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.039> know<00:01:19.069> if

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
frequently it's kind of a you know if

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.870 
frequently it's kind of a you know if
you<00:01:19.310> set<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:19.639> like<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.299> well<00:01:21.229> for<00:01:21.499> a<00:01:21.529> while<00:01:21.740> so

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.519 

okay<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:26.029> tighten<00:01:26.270> down<00:01:26.329> the<00:01:26.450> 5d<00:01:27.289> so<00:01:27.439> it's

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:27.529 
okay so I tighten down the 5d so it's

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:28.719 
okay so I tighten down the 5d so it's
not<00:01:27.619> flopping<00:01:27.889> around<00:01:28.100> quite<00:01:28.399> so<00:01:28.549> much

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
not flopping around quite so much

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.629 
not flopping around quite so much
anymore<00:01:29.619> what<00:01:30.619> I'm<00:01:30.709> saying<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.009> we<00:01:31.100> need<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.340> we

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:31.639 
anymore what I'm saying is we need to we

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.699 
anymore what I'm saying is we need to we
need<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.850> balance<00:01:32.029> this<00:01:32.389> whole<00:01:32.499> tilt<00:01:33.499> axis

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
need to balance this whole tilt axis

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.999 
need to balance this whole tilt axis
assembly<00:01:34.399> from<00:01:34.579> from<00:01:34.939> this<00:01:35.119> point<00:01:35.859> from<00:01:36.859> this

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
assembly from from this point from this

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.339 
assembly from from this point from this
point<00:01:37.249> forward<00:01:37.399> this<00:01:38.299> point<00:01:38.539> here<00:01:38.749> forward<00:01:39.200> we

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
point forward this point here forward we

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.899 
point forward this point here forward we
need<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.560> shoot<00:01:39.649> that<00:01:39.799> all<00:01:39.979> as<00:01:40.099> one<00:01:40.340> assembly

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
need to shoot that all as one assembly

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.599 
need to shoot that all as one assembly
and<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:42.259> whole<00:01:42.560> assembly<00:01:43.069> needs<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.490> be

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
and that whole assembly needs to be

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.980 
and that whole assembly needs to be
balanced<00:01:44.060> when<00:01:44.209> I<00:01:44.240> pick<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.539> up<00:01:44.599> right<00:01:44.840> now

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
balanced when I pick that up right now

this<00:01:45.709> thing<00:01:45.920> leans<00:01:46.159> over<00:01:46.369> at<00:01:46.609> about<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.789> 45

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
this thing leans over at about a 45

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.129 
this thing leans over at about a 45
degree<00:01:47.209> angle<00:01:47.479> that's<00:01:47.779> nowhere<00:01:47.990> near

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
degree angle that's nowhere near

balanced<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:48.829> if<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.039> were<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.189> try<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.520> use

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
balanced and if we were to try and use

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.760 
balanced and if we were to try and use
it<00:01:49.849> like<00:01:49.969> this<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.810> flight<00:01:50.990> control<00:01:51.349> systems

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
it like this the flight control systems

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.179 
it like this the flight control systems
are<00:01:51.919> going<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.099> have<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.369> really<00:01:52.700> tough<00:01:53.060> time

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
are going to have a really tough time

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.769 
are going to have a really tough time
balancing<00:01:55.189> gyro<00:01:55.789> stabilizing<00:01:56.450> something

that's<00:01:56.929> still<00:01:57.169> out<00:01:57.289> about<00:01:57.499> us<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:58.689> what<00:01:59.689> we

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
that's still out about us so what we

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.629 
that's still out about us so what we
need<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.529> we<00:02:00.859> need<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.130> take<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
need to do is we need to take and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.209 
need to do is we need to take and
actually<00:02:02.090> slide<00:02:02.419> this<00:02:02.719> whole<00:02:02.959> assembly<00:02:03.560> over

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually slide this whole assembly over

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.120 
actually slide this whole assembly over
that<00:02:04.429> way<00:02:05.469> that's<00:02:06.469> going<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.770> require

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.440 

taking<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.220> camera<00:02:10.640> off<00:02:10.820> we're<00:02:11.210> kind<00:02:11.390> of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
taking the camera off we're kind of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.240 
taking the camera off we're kind of
getting<00:02:11.660> sneaky<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.410> an<00:02:12.530> allen<00:02:12.830> wrench<00:02:12.860> I'm

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
getting sneaky with an allen wrench I'm

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.040 
getting sneaky with an allen wrench I'm
going<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> little<00:02:14.720> bit<00:02:14.930> stingy

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
going to just get a little bit stingy

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.020 
going to just get a little bit stingy
with<00:02:15.320> an<00:02:15.410> allen<00:02:15.650> wrench<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.950> try<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.430> don't

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
with an allen wrench to try and don't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610 
with an allen wrench to try and don't
have<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.270> dismount<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.810> whole<00:02:17.930> thing<00:02:18.140> I'm

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
have to dismount this whole thing I'm

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.030 
have to dismount this whole thing I'm
just<00:02:18.740> going<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.980> loosen<00:02:19.130> up<00:02:20.560> loosen<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.860> one

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
just going to loosen up loosen that one

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.820 
just going to loosen up loosen that one
and<00:02:25.040> some<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.459> one<00:02:26.470> hopefully<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:27.650> loose

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and some that one hopefully that's loose

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.350 
and some that one hopefully that's loose
enough<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.580> slide<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:29.090> whole

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
enough that I can just slide this whole

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.620 
enough that I can just slide this whole
yeah<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.140> wiggle<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.830> i<00:02:31.630> wiggle

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
yeah if I wiggle it like this i wiggle

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.910 
yeah if I wiggle it like this i wiggle
it<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.750> like<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.709> whole

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
it just like this I can get this whole

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.520 
it just like this I can get this whole
assembly<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:35.030> slide<00:02:35.270> right<00:02:35.300> over<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
assembly to just slide right over so I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.330 
assembly to just slide right over so I
slid<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.860> over<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.370> don't<00:02:37.730> know<00:02:37.870> an<00:02:38.870> inch<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.220> I'm

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
slid it over I don't know an inch so I'm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
slid it over I don't know an inch so I'm
going<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.520> retighten<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:43.370> up<00:02:44.140> retighten

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
going to retighten that up retighten

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.170 
going to retighten that up retighten
that<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.540> up<00:02:47.830> let's<00:02:48.830> fold<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.280> back<00:02:49.430> open<00:02:49.850> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that one up let's fold it back open and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.150 
that one up let's fold it back open and
let's<00:02:50.510> see<00:02:51.340> we're<00:02:52.340> getting<00:02:52.430> closer<00:02:54.100> okay<00:02:55.100> so

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
let's see we're getting closer okay so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.260 
let's see we're getting closer okay so
you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.430> see<00:02:55.550> we're<00:02:55.670> getting<00:02:55.760> much<00:02:56.060> closer

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
you can see we're getting much closer

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.610 
you can see we're getting much closer
I'm<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:56.690> putting<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:56.930> my<00:02:57.050> finger<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.380> it's

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
I'm just putting on my finger and it's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040 
I'm just putting on my finger and it's
balancing<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.570> all<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.989> either

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
balancing you can all you can either

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.100 
balancing you can all you can either
feel<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.709> if<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.860> move<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.370> roll<00:03:01.520> axis

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
feel for it if you move the roll axis

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.680 
feel for it if you move the roll axis
just<00:03:03.110> let<00:03:03.260> go<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.709> if<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.890> stays<00:03:04.130> where<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.520> is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
just let go see if it stays where it is

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.880 
just let go see if it stays where it is
if<00:03:05.690> wants<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.050> just<00:03:06.200> stay<00:03:06.440> there<00:03:06.620> naturally

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
if wants to just stay there naturally

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.190 
if wants to just stay there naturally
you're<00:03:07.730> getting<00:03:07.940> pretty<00:03:08.030> close<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.540> down<00:03:08.750> same

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
you're getting pretty close on down same

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.740 
you're getting pretty close on down same
with<00:03:09.380> tilt<00:03:09.620> tilt<00:03:10.190> right<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:11.799> can<00:03:12.799> move<00:03:13.010> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
with tilt tilt right now is can move it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.840 
with tilt tilt right now is can move it
just<00:03:14.750> wants<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.049> stay<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.440> when<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.519> really

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
just wants to stay there when you really

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.640 
just wants to stay there when you really
when<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.390> really<00:03:17.690> get<00:03:17.810> into<00:03:18.049> balancing<00:03:18.470> this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
when you really get into balancing this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.640 
when you really get into balancing this
perfectly<00:03:19.160> for<00:03:19.549> whatever<00:03:19.820> whatever<00:03:20.209> your

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
perfectly for whatever whatever your

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.690 
perfectly for whatever whatever your
setup<00:03:21.650> will<00:03:21.799> be<00:03:21.830> with<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.220> camera<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.670> can

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
setup will be with the camera you can

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.330 
setup will be with the camera you can
actually<00:03:23.000> remove<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.510> belts<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.260> each<00:03:24.860> axis

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
actually remove the belts from each axis

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.979 
actually remove the belts from each axis
and<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.940> allow<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.450> perfect

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
and that will allow you to perfect

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.380 
and that will allow you to perfect
perfectly<00:03:27.650> balanced<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:28.910> go<00:03:29.090> through

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
perfectly balanced it so just go through

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.880 
perfectly balanced it so just go through
a<00:03:29.450> similar<00:03:29.690> system<00:03:30.080> like<00:03:30.380> I've<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.680> showed

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
a similar system like I've just showed

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.800 
a similar system like I've just showed
you<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.280> we'll<00:03:32.000> need<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.330> we'll<00:03:32.660> need<00:03:32.750> to

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
you and we'll need to we'll need to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.600 
you and we'll need to we'll need to
adjust<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:34.220> know<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.430> position

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
adjust you know the position

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.640 
adjust you know the position
fore-and-aft<00:03:35.420> of<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.750> camera<00:03:36.080> on<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.380> camera

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
fore-and-aft of the camera on the camera

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.229 
fore-and-aft of the camera on the camera
plate<00:03:36.860> depending<00:03:37.519> on<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.670> camera<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.090> might

plate depending on the camera you might

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.670 
plate depending on the camera you might
have<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.510> switch<00:03:38.690> flip<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.260> camera<00:03:39.410> play

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
have to switch flip the camera play

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.039 
have to switch flip the camera play
around<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.579> it's<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.269> very<00:03:41.420> long<00:03:41.600> camera

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
around if it's a it's a very long camera

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.350 
around if it's a it's a very long camera
like<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.320> fs100<00:03:42.769> with<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> 5d<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.209> get

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
like the fs100 with a 5d you can get

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.030 
like the fs100 with a 5d you can get
away<00:03:44.450> with<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:44.840> stock<00:03:45.110> configuration<00:03:45.350> and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
away with it in stock configuration and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.600 
away with it in stock configuration and
just<00:03:46.459> sliding<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:46.940> back<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.299> forth<00:03:48.610> we'll

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
just sliding it back and forth we'll

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.650 
just sliding it back and forth we'll
need<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:51.170> know<00:03:51.290> just<00:03:52.120> adjust<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.390> whole

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
need to you know just adjust this whole

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.630 
need to you know just adjust this whole
part<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.260> gimbal<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.100> when<00:03:55.370> we<00:03:55.459> pick

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
part of the gimbal so that when we pick

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.789 
part of the gimbal so that when we pick
this<00:03:55.760> thing<00:03:55.820> up<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.540> doesn't<00:03:56.870> want<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.079> move<00:03:57.230> it

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
this thing up it doesn't want to move it

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.259 
this thing up it doesn't want to move it
doesn't<00:03:58.040> have<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.250> go<00:03:58.400> level<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.120> has<00:03:59.239> to

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
doesn't have to go level it just has to

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.380 
doesn't have to go level it just has to
want<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.600> stay<00:03:59.750> where<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.079> is<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.620> it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
want to stay where it is so that it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.080 
want to stay where it is so that it's
there's<00:04:02.390> there's<00:04:02.720> no<00:04:03.140> force<00:04:03.850> trying<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:04.880> pull

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
there's there's no force trying to pull

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.670 
there's there's no force trying to pull
the<00:04:05.299> roll<00:04:05.510> axis<00:04:05.750> one<00:04:06.079> way<00:04:06.230> or<00:04:06.290> another<00:04:06.350> it's

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
the roll axis one way or another it's

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.650 
the roll axis one way or another it's
perfectly<00:04:07.070> balanced<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:08.030> gives<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.450> this

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
perfectly balanced this gives it this

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.270 
perfectly balanced this gives it this
gives<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.260> lowest<00:04:09.530> inertia<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.160> can

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
gives the lowest inertia that we can

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.340 
gives the lowest inertia that we can
possibly<00:04:10.400> get<00:04:10.850> with<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.090> gimbal<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.079> allows

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
possibly get with the gimbal and allows

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.560 
possibly get with the gimbal and allows
the<00:04:12.680> flight<00:04:13.489> control<00:04:13.820> systems<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.360> do<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
the flight control systems to do the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.839 
the flight control systems to do the
best<00:04:14.690> job<00:04:14.810> they<00:04:14.959> possibly<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.769> so<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.669> last

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
best job they possibly can so the last

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.510 
best job they possibly can so the last
step<00:04:17.150> with<00:04:17.660> all<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.200> just<00:04:19.039> mounting<00:04:19.370> this

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
step with all this is just mounting this

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.900 
step with all this is just mounting this
gimbal<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.660> sin

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
gimbal to the sin

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.890 
gimbal to the sin
stuff<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.250> what<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.180> looks<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.720> I've

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
stuff and what that looks like is I've

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.710 
stuff and what that looks like is I've
got<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.050> sinistari<00:04:25.910> camera<00:04:26.910> mounting<00:04:27.270> bracket

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
got a sinistari camera mounting bracket

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.690 
got a sinistari camera mounting bracket
right<00:04:27.810> here<00:04:27.870> it's<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:28.650> got<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.340> you've

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
right here it's just got you know you've

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.190 
right here it's just got you know you've
probably<00:04:30.090> familiar<00:04:30.360> with<00:04:30.600> these<00:04:30.750> clamps<00:04:31.020> at

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
probably familiar with these clamps at

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.590 
probably familiar with these clamps at
this<00:04:31.350> point<00:04:31.620> we<00:04:31.740> use<00:04:31.890> them<00:04:32.010> everywhere<00:04:32.600> you'll

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
this point we use them everywhere you'll

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.090 
this point we use them everywhere you'll
just<00:04:33.780> slide<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.080> in<00:04:36.530> tighten<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.620> down<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
just slide that in tighten that down and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.060 
just slide that in tighten that down and
then<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:39.180> know<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.450> mounts<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:40.020> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
then you know this mounts to the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.220 
then you know this mounts to the
vibration<00:04:41.070> Isolators<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.870> actually<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
vibration Isolators you actually the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.260 
vibration Isolators you actually the
ability<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.620> slide<00:04:43.920> this<00:04:44.190> fore<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.700> aft<00:04:44.970> as

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
ability to slide this fore and aft as

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.740 
ability to slide this fore and aft as
well<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:47.310> want<00:04:47.580> when<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.450> attached

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
well to you want when this is attached

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.810 
well to you want when this is attached
to<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> sin<00:04:49.320> estar<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:50.280> want<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.940> be

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
to the sin estar you want it to be

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.570 
to the sin estar you want it to be
centrally<00:04:53.820> balanced<00:04:54.420> load<00:04:55.260> on<00:04:55.680> this<00:04:55.950> plate<00:04:56.280> so

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
centrally balanced load on this plate so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.250 
centrally balanced load on this plate so
that<00:04:56.610> it's<00:04:56.850> putting<00:04:57.090> equal<00:04:57.570> pressure<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:58.080> each

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
that it's putting equal pressure on each

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
one of these vibration Isolators and you

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.020 
one of these vibration Isolators and you
can<00:05:00.300> adjust<00:05:00.420> that<00:05:00.840> by<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.610> know<00:05:02.730> making<00:05:02.910> sure

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
can adjust that by you know making sure

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.940 
can adjust that by you know making sure
that<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.840> gimbal<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:04.350> perfectly<00:05:04.710> lined

the<00:05:27.360> Isolators<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.900> we<00:05:27.960> really<00:05:28.200> want<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.470> have

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
the Isolators and we really want to have

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.340 
the Isolators and we really want to have
each<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.730> those<00:05:29.850> Isolators<00:05:30.420> isolating<00:05:31.230> in

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
each of those Isolators isolating in

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.810 
each of those Isolators isolating in
this<00:05:31.530> in<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.830> same<00:05:31.980> exact<00:05:32.310> way<00:05:34.700> alright<00:05:35.700> so

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
this in the same exact way alright so

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.280 
this in the same exact way alright so
realizing<00:05:36.240> that<00:05:36.390> last<00:05:36.600> step<00:05:36.780> my<00:05:36.960> hands<00:05:37.140> were

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
realizing that last step my hands were

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.020 
realizing that last step my hands were
in<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.470> way<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.620> lot<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.280> 5d<00:05:38.669> was<00:05:38.850> in<00:05:38.970> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
in the way a lot and the 5d was in the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.970 
in the way a lot and the 5d was in the
way<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> little<00:05:39.300> bit<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:40.230> don't<00:05:40.620> know<00:05:40.710> if<00:05:40.830> you

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
way a little bit and I don't know if you

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.140 
way a little bit and I don't know if you
could<00:05:41.130> exactly<00:05:41.520> see<00:05:41.700> what<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:41.910> was<00:05:42.060> adjusting

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
could exactly see what I was adjusting

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.600 
could exactly see what I was adjusting
so<00:05:42.720> when<00:05:43.260> we<00:05:43.380> were<00:05:43.440> adjusting<00:05:43.890> for<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.250> for

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
so when we were adjusting for the for

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.280 
so when we were adjusting for the for
the<00:05:44.640> roll<00:05:44.850> axis<00:05:45.090> what<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.900> actually<00:05:46.140> moving

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
the roll axis what is actually moving

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.830 
the roll axis what is actually moving
back<00:05:46.620> as<00:05:46.860> moving<00:05:47.400> sliding<00:05:48.150> this<00:05:48.330> whole<00:05:48.540> piece

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
back as moving sliding this whole piece

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.230 
back as moving sliding this whole piece
so<00:05:49.260> this<00:05:49.440> whole<00:05:49.560> piece<00:05:49.890> can<00:05:50.220> slide<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
so this whole piece can slide to the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.450 
so this whole piece can slide to the
left<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.810> right<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.800> allows<00:05:53.130> you

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
left and the right and this allows you

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.230 
left and the right and this allows you
to<00:05:53.669> cg<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.390> entire<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:55.620> entire<00:05:56.090> part<00:05:57.090> of

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
to cg this entire this entire part of

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.720 
to cg this entire this entire part of
the<00:05:57.300> gimbal<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:58.080> whole<00:05:58.169> tilt<00:05:58.500> mechanism<00:05:58.830> and

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
the gimbal the whole tilt mechanism and

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.270 
the gimbal the whole tilt mechanism and
it<00:06:00.000> allows<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.570> cg<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.080> as<00:06:01.200> one<00:06:01.410> piece<00:06:01.680> so

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
it allows you to cg it as one piece so

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.240 
it allows you to cg it as one piece so
you<00:06:03.210> have<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.419> ability<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.810> slide<00:06:04.169> the<00:06:04.890> camera

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
you have the ability to slide the camera

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.270 
you have the ability to slide the camera
melt<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.669> camera<00:06:06.000> mounting<00:06:06.360> plate<00:06:06.810> for<00:06:07.620> side

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
melt the camera mounting plate for side

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.280 
melt the camera mounting plate for side
to<00:06:08.430> side<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.880> then<00:06:09.720> you<00:06:09.840> also<00:06:09.960> have<00:06:10.110> the

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
to side and then you also have the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.710 
to side and then you also have the
ability<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.680> slide<00:06:10.919> that<00:06:11.790> whole<00:06:12.180> assembly

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
ability to slide that whole assembly

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.270 
ability to slide that whole assembly
side<00:06:12.930> to<00:06:13.080> side<00:06:13.230> so<00:06:13.440> between<00:06:13.650> those<00:06:13.860> two<00:06:14.070> things

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
side to side so between those two things

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.090 
side to side so between those two things
you<00:06:15.180> will<00:06:15.300> be<00:06:15.419> able<00:06:15.510> to<00:06:15.780> get<00:06:16.020> it<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:16.860> the

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
you will be able to get it so that the

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.800 
you will be able to get it so that the
camera<00:06:20.100> is<00:06:20.130> perfectly<00:06:20.669> cjd<00:06:21.270> for<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.630> roll

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
camera is perfectly cjd for the roll

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.420 
camera is perfectly cjd for the roll
axis<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.500> then<00:06:22.650> you'll<00:06:22.770> also<00:06:22.890> be<00:06:23.100> able<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.310> get

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
axis and then you'll also be able to get

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.980 
axis and then you'll also be able to get
it<00:06:23.550> so<00:06:23.700> that<00:06:23.850> when<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.090> try<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:24.330> pick<00:06:24.570> pick

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
it so that when you try and pick pick

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.750 
it so that when you try and pick pick
the<00:06:25.140> whole<00:06:25.290> unit<00:06:25.650> up<00:06:25.770> ready<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.340> ready<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.669> fly

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
the whole unit up ready and ready to fly

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.700 
the whole unit up ready and ready to fly
stay<00:06:27.060> from<00:06:27.270> this<00:06:27.450> that<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.810> is<00:06:28.140> all<00:06:28.320> CG

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
stay from this that that is all CG

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.950 
stay from this that that is all CG
tazewell<00:06:29.130> so<00:06:29.729> i<00:06:30.030> just<00:06:30.390> wanted<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.660> point<00:06:30.750> that

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
tazewell so i just wanted to point that

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.490 
tazewell so i just wanted to point that
out<00:06:31.080> with

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
out with

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.080 
out with
the<00:06:31.710> camera<00:06:32.040> being<00:06:32.190> in<00:06:32.340> the<00:06:32.430> way<00:06:32.580> I<00:06:32.610> found<00:06:33.030> my

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
the camera being in the way I found my

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.690 
the camera being in the way I found my
hands<00:06:33.390> in<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.570> way
