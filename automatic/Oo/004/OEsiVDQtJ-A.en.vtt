00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940
 This is a home-made HGUC gym. It is what was painted in the gym color of Gundam color and is painted in the real type style 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.860
 It is a gym of normal painting. I am inking in black of frost 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 It is the back side. I forgot to paint the rear camera 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 I do not like it very much for myself because the line is too clear because I painted the inking in black and painted it 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.720
 I painted silver from the back of the camera part, but I could see the pin part of the part clearly 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:22.640
 The part of the ear stuck Wave made H eye 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.720
 It looks like this from the side 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.780
 Joints were painted in neutral gray 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 Next is the gym painted in a real type style 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.820
 White: Creos white FS 17875, red: Gundam color MS red, yellow: Creos yellow, Joint: neutral gray 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.800
 Vernier is metal black Rearview camera is enameled green 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.720
 The beam spray gun was painted in Gundam color phantom gray, and inking was painted in enamel light gray. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.140
 Then I applied a decal and painted a frosted clear. 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.200
 We stuck aluminum tape to mold of the back of camera parts 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 It looks like this from the back 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.140
 I painted a clear clear with camera parts, some sort of tape will stand out 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.180
 The part of the ear was attached by duplicating MSV Jim Cannon's parts with wave type thought 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.100
 Decals used GSR color decals and NC decals 06 of HIQPARTS. I used Mr Marksetter because some red lines didn't fit well. 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.980
 I painted the armor of the ankle and then cut out a part to fit in, I cut the inside of the ankle 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.220
 Well, I feel like this, I would like to be able to fix the bad part next 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.360
 end
