construction on these drum shells is
what<00:02:36.659> DW<00:02:37.049> calls<00:02:37.230> VLT<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.430> stands<00:02:38.670> for

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
what DW calls VLT that stands for

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.759 
what DW calls VLT that stands for
vertical<00:02:39.120> Lotan<00:02:39.810> burr<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.170> what<00:02:40.680> they

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
vertical Lotan burr and what they

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.069 
vertical Lotan burr and what they

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
the DW factory back in California is

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.170 
the DW factory back in California is
that<00:02:45.769> traditionally<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.310> outer<00:02:47.489> ply<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:48.060> the

that traditionally the outer ply of the
drum<00:02:48.359> shell<00:02:48.599> runs<00:02:49.049> horizontally<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.859> if<00:02:49.950> you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
drum shell runs horizontally so if you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740 
drum shell runs horizontally so if you
look<00:02:50.189> at<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.459> there<00:02:50.730> was<00:02:50.819> wood<00:02:51.209> grain<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.629> not

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
look at if there was wood grain and not

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.420 
look at if there was wood grain and not
the<00:02:51.900> wrap<00:02:52.079> you'd<00:02:52.379> see<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.859> wood<00:02:53.400> grain

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the wrap you'd see the wood grain

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.009 
the wrap you'd see the wood grain
running<00:02:53.760> horizontally<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.720> they<00:02:54.840> found

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
running horizontally but what they found

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.199 
running horizontally but what they found
was<00:02:55.319> when<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.220> changed<00:02:56.639> that<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.970> put<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
was when they changed that and put the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.580 
was when they changed that and put the
wood<00:02:57.329> grains<00:02:57.569> going<00:02:57.750> vertically<00:02:58.409> on<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
wood grains going vertically on the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.199 
wood grains going vertically on the
inner<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:58.980> outer<00:02:59.250> ply<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> drum<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
inner and outer ply of the drum it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.659 
inner and outer ply of the drum it
brought<00:03:00.689> down<00:03:00.719> the<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.650> low-end<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.370> gave<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
brought down the the low-end it gave the

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.849 
brought down the the low-end it gave the
drum<00:03:02.879> a<00:03:02.909> great<00:03:03.269> low<00:03:03.629> fundamental<00:03:04.349> tone<00:03:04.530> lower

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
drum a great low fundamental tone lower

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.979 
drum a great low fundamental tone lower
than<00:03:05.129> traditional<00:03:05.669> horizontal<00:03:06.150> wood<00:03:06.750> grain

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
than traditional horizontal wood grain

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.470 
than traditional horizontal wood grain
so<00:03:07.859> that's<00:03:08.760> what<00:03:08.879> they<00:03:08.939> did<00:03:08.969> they<00:03:09.180> combined

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so that's what they did they combined

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.849 
so that's what they did they combined
the<00:03:09.599> wood<00:03:09.719> grains<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.530> turn<00:03:10.739> outer

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
the wood grains like that in turn outer

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.319 
the wood grains like that in turn outer
plied<00:03:11.129> running<00:03:11.549> vertically<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.299> a

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
plied running vertically and you get a

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.319 
plied running vertically and you get a
really<00:03:12.689> great<00:03:12.900> low<00:03:13.260> deep<00:03:13.829> tone<00:03:14.219> very<00:03:14.700> warm<00:03:15.030> and

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
really great low deep tone very warm and

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.240 
really great low deep tone very warm and
the<00:03:15.719> maple<00:03:15.870> brings<00:03:16.230> out<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.590> brightness<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the maple brings out the brightness the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.009 
the maple brings out the brightness the
projection<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.120> resonance<00:03:18.479> so<00:03:18.840> great

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
projection and the resonance so great

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.780 
projection and the resonance so great
combination<00:03:19.590> they're<00:03:19.799> really<00:03:20.370> cool<00:03:20.489> drums

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
combination they're really cool drums

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.199 
combination they're really cool drums
really<00:03:21.090> fun<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.359> play<00:03:21.599> great<00:03:22.199> warm<00:03:22.470> tone<00:03:23.209> let

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
really fun to play great warm tone let

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.819 
really fun to play great warm tone let
me<00:03:24.299> show<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.629> tone<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.109> demonstrate<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829

two<00:04:05.200> ply<00:04:05.440> heads<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:06.730> will<00:04:06.819> give<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.060> a

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
so well you can take them to many many

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.690 
so well you can take them to many many
