00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to say three stars for these definitely

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.490 
to say three stars for these definitely
worth<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.519> try<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.209> they're<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> good<00:02:45.959> potato

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
worth the try and they're a good potato

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.030 
worth the try and they're a good potato
chip<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.190> would<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.610> well<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.390> dips

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
chip that would go well with these dips

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.410 
chip that would go well with these dips
but<00:02:50.040> they're<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.820> change<00:02:51.150> your
