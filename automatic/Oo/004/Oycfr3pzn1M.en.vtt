00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 greetings seekers of mystery and 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.170
 thank you for attending great mystery 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.620
 org point this short video has ends 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.570
 informative since I'm going to perform the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.650
 third UFO alert on April 18 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 for those who do not know what an alert is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.689
 UFO what it is is to coordinate 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.269
 many countries many people all the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 who wants to participate be coordinated 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.630
 between us going out at night look 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.980
 the stars and look if we find 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 some strange phenomenon at night but 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.680
 that would be the secondary purpose since 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.710
 the primary purpose the goal would be 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 gather people to talk about 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 mysteries meet with friends with the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.329
 family and between all look simply 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.930
 the stars and talk about mysteries 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.660
 I think that is what is needed in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.190
 this society and leave television for 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.979
 at least a few hours without seeing it 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.440
 and nothing that is what we are going to propose 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.920
 again this will be the third edition 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.290
 of the UFO alert and it will be as well 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.150
 I say we will do on April 18 to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.149
 the people who are from other countries because 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.759
 we will leave in Spain 'for the 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.460
 night we will also be day 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.770
 pending to your night in your 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.950
 country since they are different schedules but 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.380
 we will be all morning and all night 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 pending what you are sending us 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.640
 in the twitter hashtag the hashtag is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.520

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.200
 and ultimately about that hashtag 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.660
 we can go communicating another method 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.360

 channel that is called mysteries to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.500
 discover in the open and through that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.880
 application we can talk as if outside 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 a walkie talkie that does not understand 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.190

 twitter something else we will do a live 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.900
 before going out at night to look 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.680
 these UFOs although I already tell you the alert 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.780
 UFO look for UFOs that's secondary 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.709
 we will be live on youtube at 8 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.950

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.019
 alert will put us in real time 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 through several calls to our 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.710
