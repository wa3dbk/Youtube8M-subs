00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
little bit of water maybe a little bit

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.270 
little bit of water maybe a little bit
of<00:02:38.709> blue<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.459> soften<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:41.069> bring<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.160> up

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
of blue just to soften it up bring it up

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.699 
of blue just to soften it up bring it up
a<00:02:42.400> little<00:02:42.550> more

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
a little more

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.640 
a little more
well<00:02:44.709> black<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.220> meet<00:02:45.430> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.949 

by<00:02:50.650> adding<00:02:50.830> black<00:02:51.250> or<00:02:51.549> white<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.540> very

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
by adding black or white to a very

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.309 
by adding black or white to a very
chromatic<00:02:53.680> color<00:02:54.370> you're<00:02:54.909> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.510> diffuse

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
chromatic color you're going to diffuse

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.050 
chromatic color you're going to diffuse
the<00:02:56.709> intensity<00:02:57.400> or<00:02:57.780> chroma<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.409> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the intensity or chroma of the of the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.009 
the intensity or chroma of the of the
color<00:03:01.060> itself<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.599> we're<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:01.989> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
color itself so we're just going to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.649 
color itself so we're just going to
block<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.590> here<00:03:03.750> real<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:06.659> really

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
block it in here real you know really

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.819 
block it in here real you know really
easily<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.900> want<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.110> think<00:03:11.319> about<00:03:11.440> too

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
easily I don't want to think about too

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.190 
easily I don't want to think about too
much<00:03:12.069> while<00:03:13.000> I'm<00:03:13.150> working<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.659> this<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.140> just

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
much while I'm working on this I just

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.479 
much while I'm working on this I just
want<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.310> canvas<00:03:15.700> covered<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:18.370> when

want to get the canvas covered just when
I<00:03:18.519> cover<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:19.000> as<00:03:19.120> best<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.629> I<00:03:20.200> don't<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:21.099> to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
I cover it as best I can I don't want to

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.720 
I cover it as best I can I don't want to
go<00:03:21.250> totally<00:03:21.549> black<00:03:22.799> now<00:03:23.799> see<00:03:24.040> how<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.459> if

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
go totally black now see how this if

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.220 
go totally black now see how this if
this<00:03:24.970> was<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> white<00:03:25.420> surface<00:03:25.660> all<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.109> this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
this was a white surface all of this

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.630 
this was a white surface all of this
white<00:03:26.530> back<00:03:26.799> there<00:03:27.040> would<00:03:27.160> have<00:03:27.250> been<00:03:27.400> shown

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
white back there would have been shown

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.059 
white back there would have been shown
to<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.120> since<00:03:28.329> I<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.629> my<00:03:28.930> under<00:03:29.739> painting

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
to it but since I have my under painting

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.000 
to it but since I have my under painting
down<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:31.660> already<00:03:32.049> creating<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.530> value<00:03:32.890> on

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
down it's already creating a value on

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.960 
down it's already creating a value on
its<00:03:33.190> own<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.799> I'll<00:03:35.859> just<00:03:36.129> continue<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.700> move

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
its own so I'll just continue to move

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.890 
its own so I'll just continue to move
down<00:03:43.349> I'll<00:03:44.349> see<00:03:44.560> how<00:03:44.709> I'm<00:03:44.829> kind<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.159> just

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
down I'll see how I'm kind of just

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.300 
down I'll see how I'm kind of just
loosely<00:03:46.900> putting<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.560> there<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:47.890> random

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
loosely putting it in there in a random

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.309 
loosely putting it in there in a random
pattern<00:03:48.790> I'm<00:03:49.150> not<00:03:49.299> going<00:03:49.659> this<00:03:49.840> way<00:03:50.049> I'm<00:03:50.260> not

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
going this way I'm just kind of filling

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.349 
going this way I'm just kind of filling
it<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.139> don't<00:03:53.829> want<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.220> once<00:03:54.970> again<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.239> don't

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
it in I don't want to once again I don't

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.039 
it in I don't want to once again I don't
want<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> think<00:03:56.079> too<00:03:56.200> much<00:03:56.319> while<00:03:56.709> I'm<00:03:57.060> at<00:03:58.060> this

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
want to think too much while I'm at this

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:11.340 
want to think too much while I'm at this
stage<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> game

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
it out a little bit so it does have a
