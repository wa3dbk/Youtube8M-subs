00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.019
 parts surely the first of them 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.120

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.909
 where I have the computer and the xbox 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.170
 this is a chair and this is where the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.450
 screen 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.909
 the laptop the desktop that I do not use 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.320
 the mic with which I am recording in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.940
 now it is with that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.440
 that I bought myself and little else we will see a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.300
 little bit 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.480

 gold corp has a graph of 512 is 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 pretty mediocre the graph that you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.900
 let's ask a laptop that has already 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.080
 more than 4 years and I have it connected by 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
 is on television although I do not use it as 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
 television and in the background is also 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.290
 connected to part of de gea del 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 computer the component cable that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.159
 comes from xbox is this on its blue wire 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.319
 here 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 in the background I have currently committed 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.899
 this usb which is the camera with what 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.170
 I'm recording the base of the microphone a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 usb which is the mouse that I have with cable 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.569
 what is this mouse here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.670
 and apart I have this four hub 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 ports -4 you really lose one 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080
 but well nothing happens 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.319
 are four ports and I have connected the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.189
 wireless 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.129
 for everything here to which the 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.480
 keyboard is wireless apart I have a 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.690
 wireless mouse that what did that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.210
 the one that comes with this keyboard 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.350
 and what else can I tell you good there is 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.410
 transformer on the edge of the video the xbox 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.390
 is here as you see 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 will connect also have as we have 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.450
 designed the power strip is where I have it 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.120
 by a thief with a lack of space to 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.030
 bad is the TV could have put it 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.470
 up there because it has its support what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 what happens I prefer it here 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.270
 down to see also on the computer 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 as it has already been said I like to have it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.870
 two things on the same screen and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.240
 simply with a with a change of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.240
 buttons from the menu 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.630
 let's choose the pc input source 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.210
 local already component and ready 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.750
 What else can I say good? 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.630
 teach that I have here a notebook in the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.790
 which I always write notes if I 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.580
 approached a little you will see that it is about 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.220
 the pokemon that we chose for glass 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.710
 football is fine for the little cup and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.620
 this is where I go scoring everything are 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.660
 the pokemon with their corresponding 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.020
 ticks if I take it out of red pokemon but 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.480
 the m3 I needed from each attack and 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.850
 the team attacks that is marking 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.860
 the whole antiwar levels all the node 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.350
 little is where everything here we say that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.570
 in my notebook everything was going 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.970
 pointed down here let's see what 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.820
 I have 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.790
 is the call of duty box of the xbox 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.230
 the red box from here to the bottom is the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.810
 the camera with which I am recording that 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.940
 this is the 20,000 try because always 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.470
 is going slow or my laptop does not give for 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.960
 more as soon as you put a little more 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.720
 quality or dies so let's see if this 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.670
 once it sticks well at last apart 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.430
 are the helmets of the xbox the 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.690
 producers I control and I have other 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.150
 helmets that is one that he listened to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.070
 while I play and you already have to have 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.330
 another little thing more let's see what there is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.650
 thematic drawers 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.650
 let's say that I have more materials here 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.550
 is 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.380
 among other things I have this that is the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.420
 command of play 3 with which he recorded all 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.400
 the videos is really I connect the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.420
 I send for example to the port there of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.660
 of the hub that I have white and good playing 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.180
 with this and that's because it 's more comfortable 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.420
 with the keys of the noises I have here 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.360
 Well the charger 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.770
 of the xbox battery the connector that goes 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.370
 directly so you can play 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.370
 while you play 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.950
 1s the wireless mouse will come because 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.390
 you see the right thing and only many years ago 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.390
 the lights all 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.420
 you do not want to put the lights but it works 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.960
 they put the batteries and it works 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.000
 and I have another is what they used 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.860
 You must have watch television 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.650
 it's about a switcher that allows us 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.270
 choose between components and vga for 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.790
 pass it to the monitoring of cirio campi 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.620
 folding from the component and according to 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.260
 where I had this placed in the 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.030
 little button he was showing the in the 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.030
 nice monitor would be 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.740
 very nice was shown according to the TV 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.590
 as a last part something good that is very 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.110
 important that is the part where the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.830
 part I really see my videos 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.500
 I was there 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.670
 the posts with equipment coloring 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.840
 of fails with 18 and this is a bed this 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.550
 before it was a room but really 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.220
 it's a storage room and the background looks something 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.830
 brown and it's a mirror but 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.720
 we use that is behind 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.820
 now let's see if a little bit there is 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.700
 a calendar and the door shows me the 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.210
 evils because the other 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.740
 It was full of things that are not to be seen 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.360
 because if they did not come here, 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.430
 drugs for me they wrote 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.380
 that is a junkie nothing boys 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.039
 I hope you liked it and that you continue 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.930
 being the special the second part in 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.780
 which I tell you as a bunch the videos 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.009

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.840

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.800
 goodbye greeting
