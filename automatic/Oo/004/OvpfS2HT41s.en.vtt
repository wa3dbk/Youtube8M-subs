00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.910 
really concentrated to hydrated tea
almost<00:00:29.119> which<00:00:30.119> means<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.529> ready<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

use you don't need to boil it you don't

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
use you don't need to boil it you don't
need<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.770> any<00:00:35.010> further<00:00:35.250> extraction

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
need to do any further extraction

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.900 
need to do any further extraction
because<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.219> ground-up<00:00:38.640> herb

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
because it's not just a ground-up herb

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540 
because it's not just a ground-up herb
now<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.530> herb<00:00:40.770> powders<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> the

example mountain rose sells a folk tea

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.600 
example mountain rose sells a folk tea
powder<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.710> basically<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> didn't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
powder now basically what they didn't

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.060 
powder now basically what they didn't
that<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.360> took<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.989> root<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that is they just took the root in the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
that is they just took the root in the
ground<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.760> powder<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ground up to a powder and that's it so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
ground up to a powder and that's it so
now<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.520> concentrated<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
now with that it's not concentrated and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
now with that it's not concentrated and
it's<00:01:03.420> not<00:01:03.570> extracted<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.860> basically<00:01:05.159> with

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's not extracted so basically with

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.830 
it's not extracted so basically with
that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> either<00:01:06.240> make<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> tincture

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that you need to either make a tincture

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.140 
that you need to either make a tincture
or<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> tea<00:01:07.290> out<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.680> whereas<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> who<00:01:08.909> shoe

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
or a tea out of it whereas the who shoe

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
or a tea out of it whereas the who shoe
that's<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> hyperion<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's on the hyperion side that's a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's on the hyperion side that's a
concentrated<00:01:11.549> extract<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.930> basically<00:01:13.350> what's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
concentrated extract so basically what's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.090 
concentrated extract so basically what's
been<00:01:13.770> done<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.310> they've<00:01:14.850> taken<00:01:15.170> 8<00:01:16.170> pounds<00:01:16.920> of

hosh ooh-whoo roots they put it in a big
vat<00:01:20.850> fill<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.990> water<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
vat fill it up with water and then

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.940 
vat fill it up with water and then
boiled<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.729> cooked<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.270> into

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
boiled it down and cooked it down into

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
boiled it down and cooked it down into
like<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.250> pound<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.850> concentrate<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.049> they

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
like one pound of concentrate and they

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.700 
like one pound of concentrate and they
you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.680> evaporated<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> liquid

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
you know evaporated out all the liquid

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
you know evaporated out all the liquid
so<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.979> left<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.970> fine

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so all this left this is really fine

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
so all this left this is really fine
really<00:01:34.079> easily<00:01:34.650> digested<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.549> absorbable

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really easily digested really absorbable

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
really easily digested really absorbable
powder<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.700> at<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> point<00:01:39.439> obviously<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
powder so at that point obviously you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380 
powder so at that point obviously you
don't<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> extract<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.030> don't<00:01:42.210> need

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
don't need to extract it you don't need

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
don't need to extract it you don't need
to<00:01:42.450> boil<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> cook<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> nothing

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
before but it's not really a good idea

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.590 
before but it's not really a good idea
because<00:02:09.890> they're<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.190> concentrated<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.210> it's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
because they're so concentrated and it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
I'm feeling really crazy I'll do just

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.240 
I'm feeling really crazy I'll do just
like<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:44.660> tablespoon<00:02:45.200> reishi<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.040> little

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
like one tablespoon reishi and a little

like one tablespoon reishi and a little
bit<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.430> water<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.760> chug<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.000> down<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.570> saw<00:02:48.080> some

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
bit of water and chug it down I saw some

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.949 
bit of water and chug it down I saw some
that<00:02:48.410> every<00:02:48.770> day<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:50.120> would<00:02:50.209> be<00:02:50.330> okay<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> do

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
that every day it would be okay to do

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.260 
that every day it would be okay to do
because<00:02:51.800> ratio<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.400> something<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> in

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
because ratio is something you can do in

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.140 
because ratio is something you can do in
large<00:02:53.480> amounts<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.290> okay<00:02:54.850> other<00:02:55.850> herbs

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
large amounts and be okay other herbs

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.090 
large amounts and be okay other herbs
could<00:02:56.600> be<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:57.050> too<00:02:57.230> stimulating<00:02:57.890> or<00:02:58.070> a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
could be a little too stimulating or a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.610 
could be a little too stimulating or a
little<00:02:58.400> too<00:02:58.550> calming<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.810> could<00:03:00.020> be<00:03:00.050> hard

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
little too calming or they could be hard

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.250 
little too calming or they could be hard
to<00:03:00.800> digest<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.580> absorb<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.930> could<00:03:03.110> get

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
to digest and absorb and you could get

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.990 
to digest and absorb and you could get
some<00:03:03.410> gas<00:03:03.620> or<00:03:03.950> things<00:03:04.130> like<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.340> both<00:03:04.670> reishi

and<00:05:33.509> even<00:05:33.750> things<00:05:33.960> like<00:05:34.020> going<00:05:34.409> through<00:05:34.440> as

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
and even things like going through as

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.869 
and even things like going through as
well<00:05:35.120> because<00:05:36.120> it's<00:05:36.270> such<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.449> hard<00:05:36.659> root<00:05:36.960> bark

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
well because it's such a hard root bark

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.550 
well because it's such a hard root bark
so<00:05:38.879> that's<00:05:39.000> why<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.180> find<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.629> the<00:05:39.840> powders

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
so that's why I find that the powders

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.020 
so that's why I find that the powders
are<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:40.830> much<00:05:40.979> easier<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.340> use<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.930> um<00:05:43.909> so<00:05:44.909> yeah

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
are so much easier to use so um so yeah

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.999 
are so much easier to use so um so yeah
hopefully<00:05:45.389> that's<00:05:45.720> answered<00:05:45.900> your<00:05:46.650> questions

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
hopefully that's answered your questions
