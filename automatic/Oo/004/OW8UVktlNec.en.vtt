to keep it simple and not too scientific

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.160 
to keep it simple and not too scientific
just<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> quickly<00:00:56.399> explain<00:00:56.760> how<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
just going to quickly explain how that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.920 
just going to quickly explain how that
works<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.579> you've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> darker

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
works now when you've got a darker

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
works now when you've got a darker
object<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.440> darker<00:01:01.980> skin<00:01:02.190> darker<00:01:02.730> objects

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
object or darker skin darker objects

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800 
object or darker skin darker objects
will<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.379> absorb<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:05.549> light<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
will actually absorb more light so as a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.810 
will actually absorb more light so as a
viewer<00:01:07.140> looks<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> darker<00:01:08.189> physique<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
viewer looks at a darker physique the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
viewer looks at a darker physique the
light<00:01:09.030> doesn't<00:01:09.570> bounce<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:10.229> towards<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
light doesn't bounce back towards that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
light doesn't bounce back towards that
view<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.810> lighter<00:01:13.229> whiter

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
view as it would with a lighter whiter

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
view as it would with a lighter whiter
physique<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.939> therefore<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.479> able<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
physique and so therefore you're able to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
physique and so therefore you're able to
see<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> lines<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.070> definition<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
see the lines the definition and the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
see the lines the definition and the
vascular<00:01:19.049> area<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.159> glare

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
vascular area with all that glare

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.820

bouncing but now with a lighter fizzy

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
bouncing but now with a lighter fizzy
you<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.549> tend<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> light

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you do tend to get a lot of the light

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
you do tend to get a lot of the light
that<00:01:25.200> bounces<00:01:25.439> off<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> fizzy<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> back

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that bounces off that fizzy and back

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
that bounces off that fizzy and back
towards<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.170> eyes<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> creates
