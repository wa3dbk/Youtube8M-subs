00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
like and they went one way and he went

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.570 
like and they went one way and he went
the<00:01:15.659> other<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.310> painful

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the other way so it was a very painful

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
injury it was very painful when I hurt

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
injury it was very painful when I hurt
it<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> ruptured<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it when I ruptured it and then it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
it when I ruptured it and then it
settled<00:01:23.970> down<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.720> felt<00:01:25.110> very

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
settled down but it just felt very

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.190 
settled down but it just felt very
unstable<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.130> wobbly<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> loose<00:01:27.930> knee

unstable and wobbly with a loose knee

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
unstable and wobbly with a loose knee
the<00:01:28.409> concern<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.759> continues<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> be

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the concern is if one continues to be

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
the concern is if one continues to be
active<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> play<00:01:30.960> twisting<00:01:31.439> turning<00:01:31.560> sports
