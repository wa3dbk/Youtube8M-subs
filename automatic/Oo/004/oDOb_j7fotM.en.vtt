00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.130
 a unique technology in Spain 'un 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.110
 Design and development center 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 car at the height of the big 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 reference teams and pointer in the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 aerodynamic research with the seal 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 quality of who has worked with 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 equipment like mclaren ferrari and re the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 benetton and prost 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.830
 Hand Joan Villadelprat us 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.570
 move into epsilon euskadi 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.300
 here they develop single-seaters 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.700
 competition from the renault formula to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.190
 the world series of course the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.170
 research in formula1 an operating room 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.840
 mechanical where everything is discussed 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.239
 the maximum precision and here vila the prat 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.720
 he installed his great work the wind tunnel 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.100
 this impressive and complex machinery 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.070
 starting point of all equipment of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.050
 formula 1 and here we are where the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.239
 current formula 1 because the current 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.129
 single-seaters depend on a 60 70 per 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 hundred of the aerodynamic these blades 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.670
 they see here behind they get a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.290
 speed of about 280 kilometers 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.600
 so it would be best if we see 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.250
 how they work and to know how 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 works the best thing is to recreate all the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880
 process and start a project in a way 1 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.520
 the first thing you have to understand what 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 most important of all is the regulation 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 then regulation tells you the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.119
 dimensions where you can move in 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.610
 how to forms from there 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.740
 we mold the measurements of the car with 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.439
 endless mathematical calculations for 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.110
 recreate how he would behave and for this 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.580
 then we go to another section and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.040
 as you can see here you can 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 knowing in this way we make a round 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.720
 that goes from the car from front to back and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 we can see different colors what 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
 does the air through pressures 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.810
 pressures and speed is not talked about as much 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.370
 of redbull leaks and what is it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.100
 what do we do we can see that the wheel 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.900
 from behind we have this area here and it 's 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.270
 an area so there is a big 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.870
 turbulence that they do what they have 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 done now since red bull is to launch the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.070
 pressure and the air velocity of the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.860
 escape in this area to take this 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.110
 this blue ball that we see here take it 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.690
 the points to be improved were located 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.250
 let's go for the model that will be the one 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.650
 we will introduce in the wind tunnel 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 everything is tested here and the pieces are 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.430
 installed in this design that emulates the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.620
 millimeter to the car that we will see in the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.050
 track all this is done in scale is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.180
 even if it looks like a toy toy, 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.280
 you have nothing you're talking about the investment 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 initial is more than half a million euros 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.530
 is all sexualized led suspension 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.440
 active bullet pressure gauges be 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.880
 for the heights and everything is a replica 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 of what the car has to be when 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.480
 be great 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.190
 it is clear that doing it in scale is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.320
 much cheaper and because of this the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.780
 teams use a scale model or 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.580
 perhaps the most radical changes of the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.950
 cars have left what is the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.960
 aerodynamic and you're ready to 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.690
 enter it in the tunnel where 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.430
 will undergo a long test where all 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.280
 the variants are few to check 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.520
 your best performance 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.250
 we enter the model here 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.590
 and the model we put in static what 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.140
 we put in a straight direction and we can 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.760
 carry 6 degrees 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.430
 what interests you is that a car 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.890
 work in a curve, not straight 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360
 all this is automatic and it's information 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.010
 that you are collecting picking 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.470
 picking up that after things the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.750
 engineers are analyzing and in the end 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.030
 they do what is called hero mapping 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.800
 that tells you the car in this position in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.959
 this height will have this dynamic load 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.910
 if you have one more grade you will have this load 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.290
 in america etcetera etcetera is what 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.690
 helps you understand the car in the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.980
 circuit now touches to know how 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.110
 this huge machine works 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.660
 precision to be able to generate wind 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.670
 constant so we will introduce ourselves in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.250
 his insides not without first knowing his 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.080
 engine what you see here is the engine the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.170
 electric motor of more than 1000 horses 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.209
 of power that turns the blades that 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.250
 now let's go inside let's go inside the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.100
 belly of the wind tunnel and you can see 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.489
 the bowels of what is this 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.489
 machine 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 but inside if you have not seen one of 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:15.560
 wind now what you see here 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.359
 this is the turbine that makes 425 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.700
 and with this electric motor that 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.030
 explained more than 1000 horses what 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.940
 makes is it turns these shovels and throws 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.230
 all the air to the bottom if you pass 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.500
 over here we can do the next step 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.840
 and we continue through the circular interior 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.190
 just in front of the car the most 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.400
 technique where the air 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.440
 he does it tour the city he goes walking 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.420
 all these are wing profiles 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.060
 that is in studying the taxes of 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.420
 a specific way with sensors 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.090
 they blow they move moving it up 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.480
 that in all areas from the same 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.070
 Pressure speed a tool 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.320
 of laboratory that measures grams of 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.470
 pressure applicable also to others 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.150
 sports but especially for 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.780
 unstoppable vanguard of formula 1 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.780
 and
