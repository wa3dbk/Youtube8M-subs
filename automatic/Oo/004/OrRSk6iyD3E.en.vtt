00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the clutch to move between ranges so is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.969 
the clutch to move between ranges so is
a<00:01:58.710> fairly<00:01:59.700> elaborate<00:02:00.509> system<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
a fairly elaborate system some of the

the<00:02:07.500> same<00:02:07.740> well<00:02:08.009> supply<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> engine<00:02:09.450> did

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the same well supply as the engine did
