which is a very very specific location

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
which is a very very specific location
in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.170> Warhammer<00:01:07.560> world<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in the Warhammer world so it's like a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
in the Warhammer world so it's like a
medieval<00:01:09.360> Chernobyl<00:01:10.229> basically<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.040> oozing

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
dangerous place very fun place to work

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.660 
dangerous place very fun place to work
with<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> build<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.540> video<00:01:18.750> game<00:01:18.960> on

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
with as a way to build a video game on

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
with as a way to build a video game on
no<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.659> adaptation<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.979> series<00:01:23.310> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
no I with an adaptation of a series like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
no I with an adaptation of a series like
warhammer<00:01:23.820> especially<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> specific<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
warhammer especially a specific one like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.090 
warhammer especially a specific one like
this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:28.500> slightly<00:01:28.860> easier

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
this is there a it's slightly easier

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
this is there a it's slightly easier
because<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> design<00:01:30.329> work<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
because the design work for the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
because the design work for the
creatures<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.860> characters<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.909> much

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
creatures and characters is pretty much

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
creatures and characters is pretty much
there<00:01:33.450> already<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> mean<00:01:34.049> does<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> save<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there already I mean does that save you

certain<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> start<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
certain some time at the start of the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.399 
certain some time at the start of the
project<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
project because you know what you're

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.890 
project because you know what you're
working<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.710> already<00:01:38.100> yeah<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.600> it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
working with already yeah I can say it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
working with already yeah I can say it's
it's<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> double-edged<00:01:41.009> sword<00:01:41.040> basically

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's like a double-edged sword basically

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's like a double-edged sword basically
because<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.960> yes<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> base

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
because first of all yes you have a base

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.590 
because first of all yes you have a base
a<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.610> base<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> thing<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.619> try<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
a good base but the thing is you try to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
a good base but the thing is you try to
iterate<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> add

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
iterate on top of that you want to add

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
iterate on top of that you want to add
something<00:01:50.369> new<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.600> translate<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
something new you want to translate it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
something new you want to translate it
to<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.439> video<00:01:52.799> game<00:01:53.040> medium<00:01:53.460> sometimes<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to a video game medium sometimes a

exactly as it is on a video game mode I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
exactly as it is on a video game mode I
can<00:02:00.390> say<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> artwork<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
can say so there's a lot of artwork so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
can say so there's a lot of artwork so
in<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.350> influenced<00:02:04.920> by<00:02:05.100> some

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
in a way you will get influenced by some

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
in a way you will get influenced by some
game<00:02:05.490> mechanics<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> end<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.840> need

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
game mechanics but in the end you need

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
game mechanics but in the end you need
to<00:02:07.110> analyze<00:02:07.439> everything<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.399> make<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> fit<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to analyze everything and make it fit so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.780 
to analyze everything and make it fit so
it's<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.810> fast<00:02:10.619> paced<00:02:10.920> dynamic<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's really fast paced dynamic and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's really fast paced dynamic and
things<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.840> change<00:02:13.020> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
things like that so we have to change a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.640 
things like that so we have to change a
lot<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.349> gay

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
lot of gay

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
lot of gay
mechanics<00:02:14.189> from<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.819> original<00:02:15.239> tabletop<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
mechanics from the original tabletop and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.449 
mechanics from the original tabletop and
we've<00:02:16.500> been<00:02:16.650> talking<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> lot<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.250> games

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
we've been talking a lot of a games

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
we've been talking a lot of a games
workshop<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> for<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> best<00:02:18.629> it's<00:02:19.319> going

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
workshop it is for the best it's going

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.380 
workshop it is for the best it's going
to<00:02:19.590> say<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:20.069> project<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.819> relation

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
to say that project that relation

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
to say that project that relation
process<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> working<00:02:22.049> like<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.379> does<00:02:22.590> work

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
process of working like what does work

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.929 
process of working like what does work
what<00:02:23.040> doesn't<00:02:23.400> work<00:02:23.459> because<00:02:23.549> you're<00:02:23.760> not

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
what doesn't work because you're not

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.449 
what doesn't work because you're not
just<00:02:24.209> making<00:02:24.780> tabletop<00:02:25.470> game<00:02:25.709> virtual<00:02:26.310> you're

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
just making tabletop game virtual you're

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.830 
just making tabletop game virtual you're
making<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.849> brand<00:02:27.209> new<00:02:27.329> game<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> has

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
making a brand new game that has

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.740 
making a brand new game that has
particular<00:02:28.769> themes<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.000> where<00:02:30.299> do<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.480> draw

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
particular themes so where do you draw

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
particular themes so where do you draw
the<00:02:30.840> line<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.439> where'd<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.739> decide<00:02:31.890> what

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the line and where'd you decide what

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.470 
the line and where'd you decide what
stays<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.390> goes<00:02:34.370> okay<00:02:35.370> basically<00:02:36.329> it's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
stays and what goes okay basically it's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.380 
stays and what goes okay basically it's
all<00:02:36.599> about<00:02:36.780> flow<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.819> game<00:02:39.000> needs<00:02:39.209> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
all about flow I think the game needs to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.589 
all about flow I think the game needs to
feel<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.890> everything<00:02:41.879> regarding<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
feel right so everything regarding the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.569 
feel right so everything regarding the
art<00:02:42.780> direction<00:02:42.959> everything<00:02:43.950> regarding<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
art direction everything regarding the

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.530 
art direction everything regarding the
actual<00:02:45.209> world<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.590> more<00:02:46.799> dime<00:02:47.099> city<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:48.269> kept

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
actual world the more dime city we kept

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 
actual world the more dime city we kept
its<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:49.200> faithful<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.069> tabletop<00:02:50.549> game

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
its really faithful to the tabletop game

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.629 
its really faithful to the tabletop game
what<00:02:51.359> we<00:02:51.510> changed<00:02:52.109> is<00:02:52.319> basically<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> flow<00:02:53.609> of

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
what we changed is basically the flow of

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.789 
what we changed is basically the flow of
the<00:02:53.760> game<00:02:53.849> like<00:02:54.120> i<00:02:54.239> said<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.200> tabletop<00:02:55.620> game

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
the game like i said the tabletop game

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.160 
the game like i said the tabletop game
you<00:02:56.129> play<00:02:56.370> your<00:02:56.519> war<00:02:56.730> band<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.540> units<00:02:57.959> at

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you play your war band all your units at

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.629 
you play your war band all your units at
once<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.920> other<00:02:58.950> player<00:02:59.310> player

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
once and then the other player player

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.970 
once and then the other player player
play<00:03:00.030> their<00:03:00.299> units<00:03:00.629> at<00:03:00.750> once<00:03:00.959> what<00:03:01.439> we<00:03:01.560> did<00:03:01.709> we

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
play their units at once what we did we

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.670 
play their units at once what we did we
put<00:03:02.609> it<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.849> action<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.569> initiative<00:03:04.349> ladder

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
put it in action and initiative ladder

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.509 
put it in action and initiative ladder
so<00:03:05.370> my<00:03:05.819> unit<00:03:06.090> has<00:03:06.299> some<00:03:06.920> alertness<00:03:07.920> statistics

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
so my unit has some alertness statistics

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.240 
so my unit has some alertness statistics
that<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:08.849> increase<00:03:09.269> their<00:03:10.260> position<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.950> an

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
that can increase their position in an

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.789 
that can increase their position in an
initiative<00:03:11.730> ladder<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.389> basically<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:13.530> gonna

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
initiative ladder so basically I'm gonna

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.500 
initiative ladder so basically I'm gonna
play<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.069> instance<00:03:14.579> two<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.120> my<00:03:15.150> warriors

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
play for instance two of my warriors

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
play for instance two of my warriors
then<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.019> will<00:03:16.170> play<00:03:16.349> one<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.159> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
then you will play one then I'm going to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.250 
then you will play one then I'm going to
play<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.480> lot<00:03:18.660> more<00:03:18.690> fast-paced

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
play one so it's a lot more fast-paced

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.849 
play one so it's a lot more fast-paced
and<00:03:19.739> makes<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.220> game<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.609> dynamic<00:03:21.379> no<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
and makes the game more dynamic no I the

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.159 
and makes the game more dynamic no I the
genre<00:03:23.340> itself<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.819> mean<00:03:23.970> there's<00:03:24.599> been<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.019> many

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
good that they know their limits that we

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.450 
good that they know their limits that we
have<00:06:53.539> and<00:06:53.840> we're<00:06:54.080> a<00:06:54.110> small<00:06:54.470> studio<00:06:54.740> at<00:06:55.250> Rock

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
have and we're a small studio at Rock

factor<00:06:55.759> in<00:06:55.850> Montreal<00:06:56.270> we're<00:06:56.810> 20<00:06:57.410> guys<00:06:57.560> doing

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
factor in Montreal we're 20 guys doing

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.770 
factor in Montreal we're 20 guys doing
that<00:06:58.190> game<00:06:58.430> so<00:06:58.729> really<00:06:59.270> hardcore<00:06:59.479> people

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
that game so really hardcore people

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.870 
that game so really hardcore people
really<00:07:00.380> experienced<00:07:01.130> people<00:07:01.430> but<00:07:01.639> we<00:07:01.759> have

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
really experienced people but we have

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.110 
really experienced people but we have
our<00:07:01.910> limits<00:07:02.330> too<00:07:02.660> so<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:04.039> importance<00:07:04.850> of<00:07:05.000> the

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
our limits too so the importance of the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.810 
our limits too so the importance of the
feedbacks<00:07:05.539> I<00:07:05.750> think<00:07:06.020> it's<00:07:06.259> more<00:07:06.590> on<00:07:06.979> aiming

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
feedbacks I think it's more on aiming

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.900 
feedbacks I think it's more on aiming
where<00:07:08.180> we'll<00:07:08.360> shoot<00:07:08.660> and<00:07:09.020> in<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:09.889> end<00:07:09.919> we'll

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
where we'll shoot and in the end we'll

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.230 
where we'll shoot and in the end we'll
go<00:07:11.120> in<00:07:11.240> that<00:07:11.389> direction<00:07:12.910> okay<00:07:13.910> sort<00:07:14.180> of

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
go in that direction okay sort of

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.659 
go in that direction okay sort of
wrapping<00:07:14.509> up<00:07:14.630> then<00:07:14.949> work<00:07:15.949> and<00:07:16.250> people<00:07:16.340> play

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669
