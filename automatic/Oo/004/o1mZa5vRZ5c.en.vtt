00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
connection with the activity we don't

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990

do<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.360> follow<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.880> environment

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
do they just follow and the environment

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
do they just follow and the environment
of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> kindergarten<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.860> enables<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
of the kindergarten is it enables the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.410 
of the kindergarten is it enables the
children<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:17.180> children<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
children to do that and children of this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
children to do that and children of this
age<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.869> absolute<00:01:19.619> doers<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:20.759> want

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
age are absolute doers they don't want

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.080 
age are absolute doers they don't want
to<00:01:21.210> sit<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.840> hear<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.490> something<00:01:23.759> they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to sit and hear how to do something they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
to sit and hear how to do something they
want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> work<00:01:26.580> with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
want to just do it and so we work with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
want to just do it and so we work with
that<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:28.110> let<00:01:28.770> whatever<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> coming<00:01:29.640> towards

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that to let whatever is coming towards

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
that to let whatever is coming towards
them<00:01:30.240> flow<00:01:30.509> through<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
them flow through them and this as a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
them flow through them and this as a
preparation<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> formal<00:01:33.900> learning<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
preparation for a formal learning is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.880 
preparation for a formal learning is
ideal<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> child<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.500> strong<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
ideal because if the child is strong and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.120 
ideal because if the child is strong and
capable<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.820> their<00:01:39.030> body<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> their<00:01:40.130> motor

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
capable in their body in their motor

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.840 
capable in their body in their motor
skills<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.670> react<00:01:44.670> or

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
skills in the way that they react or

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149 
skills in the way that they react or
respond<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.720> different<00:01:45.930> situations<00:01:46.829> then

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
respond to different situations then

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
respond to different situations then
they<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.670> ready<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.479> take<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.930> formal

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they will be ready to take on formal

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
they will be ready to take on formal
learning<00:01:54.680> we<00:01:55.680> follow<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.700> model<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.180> similar

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
learning we follow a model very similar

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.530 
learning we follow a model very similar
to<00:01:57.960> Scandinavian<00:01:58.890> model<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> Education<00:02:00.030> where

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
to Scandinavian model of Education where

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.230 
to Scandinavian model of Education where
learning<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.350> delayed<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.369> till<00:02:02.820> slightly

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
learning is delayed and till slightly

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
learning is delayed and till slightly
later<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> formal<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.799> academic

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
later for the formal more academic

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
later for the formal more academic
subjects<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.329> reading<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.049> writing<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
subjects like reading and writing and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
subjects like reading and writing and
mathematics<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.300> gives<00:02:09.509> us<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.780> chance

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
mathematics what that gives us a chance

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.280 
mathematics what that gives us a chance
to<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.370> develop<00:02:11.940> some<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> other

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
to do is to develop some of the other

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.880 
to do is to develop some of the other
aspects

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
aspects

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
aspects
of<00:02:13.950> Education<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.090> important<00:02:15.630> for

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
of Education that are important for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.450 
of Education that are important for
younger<00:02:15.930> children<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:16.920> develop<00:02:17.280> their

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
younger children so we develop their

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.730 
younger children so we develop their
social<00:02:17.700> capacities<00:02:18.569> their<00:02:19.080> practical

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
social capacities their practical

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.520 
social capacities their practical
capacities<00:02:20.400> their<00:02:20.730> kinesthetic<00:02:21.630> learning<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
capacities their kinesthetic learning so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.750 
capacities their kinesthetic learning so
that<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:22.830> are<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.100> comfortable<00:02:23.130> with

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that they are more comfortable with

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.300 
that they are more comfortable with
themselves<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.720> their<00:02:25.050> bodies<00:02:25.410> out<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.010> the
