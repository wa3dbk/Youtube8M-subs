00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.310
 Y 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.090
 in previous articles and videos I've 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.760
 referred to the varicocele and today we are going to 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.580
 talk about the electron butterfly and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.710
 to the elect butterfly of mine is the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.739
 surgical procedure in which 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.930
 we eliminated the varicocele we have already 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.930
 previously spoken that not all 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.559
 varicoceles require surgery but today 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.350
 I am going to refer only to surgery 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.510
 the varicose elect of mine is a surgery 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.030
 Ambulatory means that the same day 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.329
 that you operate you can go for the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.239
 house can be done under two types of 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.180
 anesthesia regional anesthesia in the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.000
 which is placed a small needle in the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.070
 back so that he falls asleep at the waist 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.259
 down or also under anesthesia 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.229
 general in which he does not stay 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.619
 totally asleep once you 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.590
 it is especially the surgery is done in 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.840
 which with that very small city 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.020
 we open in the inguinal region we look for 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 the veins 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.690
 we remove it and force it 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.900
 usually the patient at 5 or 6 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.310
 days you can resume your activities without 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.160
 have to do intense physical exercise 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 really the varicocele surgeries 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.070
 ovarian electronics is a very surgery 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 easily tolerated with very low rate of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.500
 complications the most complications 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.110
 frequent of this surgery like that of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.810
 any surgery is infection and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.650
 bleeding but with a surgical technique 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.170
 adequate is really very strange very 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.130
 scarce that presents itself in this type of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.070
 complications 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.320
 If you have been told by your doctor that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.400
 must be done to a select range of mine 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.100
 do not stop doing it for fear of 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 complications of surgery is true 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.110
 complications can occur 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.560
 however, if surgery is indicated 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.069
 must do them do not be afraid that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 it's a relatively simple surgery 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.349
 a postoperative very easily 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.349
 duality 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.370
