00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
can see I got the one of the legs of its

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
can see I got the one of the legs of its
idea<00:00:53.470> so<00:00:53.740> I<00:00:53.770> could<00:00:54.130> draw<00:00:54.580> another<00:00:54.790> card<00:00:55.060> but<00:00:56.070> by

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
idea so I could draw another card but by

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.730 
idea so I could draw another card but by
then<00:00:57.370> get<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:57.550> card<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.120> need<00:00:58.360> it<00:00:58.540> so<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.270> here

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.830 

yeah<00:01:05.740> then<00:01:06.130> activate<00:01:06.850> future<00:01:07.450> vision<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
yeah then activate future vision to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.660 
yeah then activate future vision to
which<00:01:10.840> sends<00:01:11.260> all<00:01:11.470> which<00:01:11.830> allows<00:01:12.220> him<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:12.430> pick

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
which sends all which allows him to pick

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.340 
which sends all which allows him to pick
a<00:01:12.700> fusion<00:01:13.150> ones<00:01:13.330> well<00:01:13.540> but<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.810> have<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.140> send

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
a fusion ones well but I have to send

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.290 
a fusion ones well but I have to send
the<00:01:14.560> fusion<00:01:15.040> materials<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:15.850> graveyard

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
the fusion materials to the graveyard

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.480 
the fusion materials to the graveyard
but<00:01:16.960> then<00:01:17.110> within<00:01:17.350> free<00:01:17.620> turns<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.220> summon

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
but then within free turns I can summon

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.610 
but then within free turns I can summon
that<00:01:19.120> creature<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.990> play<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.260> eventually

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
that creature in play which I eventually

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.560 
that creature in play which I eventually
do<00:01:24.010> I<00:01:24.070> think<00:01:24.220> if<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.940> remember<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.210> would

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
do I think if I remember now I would

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.230 
do I think if I remember now I would
special<00:01:29.560> summon<00:01:30.690> special<00:01:31.690> summon<00:01:33.000> exodia<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
special summon special summon exodia the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.600 
special summon special summon exodia the
ultimate<00:01:34.780> forbidden<00:01:34.990> load<00:01:35.380> bar<00:01:35.710> but<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.370> think

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
ultimate forbidden load bar but I think

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.260 
ultimate forbidden load bar but I think
is<00:01:36.790> necessary<00:01:37.360> at<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.600> moment<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.970> sets

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
is necessary at the moment so he sets

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.180 
is necessary at the moment so he sets
another<00:01:43.570> facedown<00:01:43.900> card<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.620> sits<00:01:44.890> another

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
another facedown card and sits another

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.620 
another facedown card and sits another
once<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.150> defense<00:01:46.479> mode<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.880> can<00:01:49.420> see

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
once in defense mode and then I can see

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.840 
once in defense mode and then I can see
I'm<00:01:50.080> one<00:01:50.500> time<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:50.890> passed<00:01:51.190> on<00:01:51.400> Sony<00:01:51.729> about

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
I'm one time it's passed on Sony about

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.880 
I'm one time it's passed on Sony about
two<00:01:52.150> more<00:01:52.390> less<00:01:52.540> than<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:52.870> I<00:01:52.900> get<00:01:53.260> my<00:01:53.409> blue-eyes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
two more less than so I get my blue-eyes

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.090 
two more less than so I get my blue-eyes
ultimate<00:01:54.070> dragon

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.840 

so<00:01:58.100> still<00:01:58.850> thinking<00:01:59.299> whether<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.689> should

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
so still thinking whether I should

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.490 
so still thinking whether I should
summon<00:02:01.850> exodia<00:02:03.219> Exodus<00:02:04.219> but<00:02:04.659> by<00:02:05.659> then<00:02:06.110> choose

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
summon exodia Exodus but by then choose

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.400 
summon exodia Exodus but by then choose
to<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.890> end<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.379> just<00:02:09.410> go<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.039> my<00:02:10.250> turn

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.059 

then<00:02:15.410> he<00:02:15.739> then<00:02:16.220> he<00:02:16.569> flips<00:02:17.569> his<00:02:17.750> color<00:02:18.069> into

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
then he then he flips his color into

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.619 
then he then he flips his color into
attack<00:02:19.400> mode<00:02:19.430> which<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.390> morphing<00:02:20.750> jar<00:02:20.780> which

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
attack mode which is morphing jar which

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.119 
attack mode which is morphing jar which
which<00:02:23.629> makes<00:02:23.660> me<00:02:24.110> discover<00:02:24.500> my<00:02:24.560> whole<00:02:24.860> hand

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
which makes me discover my whole hand

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.309 
which makes me discover my whole hand
and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:25.970> allows<00:02:26.450> me<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.780> draw<00:02:26.989> five<00:02:27.290> new

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and then allows me to draw five new

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.500 
and then allows me to draw five new
cards<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.480> nice<00:02:29.750> new<00:02:29.959> faith<00:02:31.180> by<00:02:32.180> lucky

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
cards which is a nice new faith by lucky

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.500 
cards which is a nice new faith by lucky
by<00:02:32.870> lucky<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.380> me<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> get<00:02:34.280> two<00:02:34.670> bits<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:35.030> Exodia

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
by lucky for me I get two bits of Exodia

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.789 
by lucky for me I get two bits of Exodia
so<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.780> need<00:02:36.260> free<00:02:36.590> move<00:02:36.829> though<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:39.170> took

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
so I need free move though and it took

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.130 
so I need free move though and it took
me<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.069> really<00:02:40.280> long<00:02:40.579> time<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:41.239> first<00:02:41.599> but<00:02:41.959> then

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
me a really long time at first but then

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.650 
me a really long time at first but then
I<00:02:42.260> cut<00:02:42.560> down<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.920> video<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.549> that<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.970> wasn't

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
I cut down the video so that it wasn't

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.390 
I cut down the video so that it wasn't
as<00:02:44.930> long<00:02:45.140> because<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.680> think<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> original

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
as long because I think the original

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.680 
as long because I think the original

his whole team and leaves him
defenseless<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.470> then<00:03:00.890> she<00:03:01.130> can<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.660> my

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.680 

yeah<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:15.100> think<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.520> other<00:03:15.640> stage<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.180> activate

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
yeah I think the other stage I activate

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.890 
yeah I think the other stage I activate
monster<00:03:16.900> reborn<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:18.390> resurrect<00:03:19.390> blue<00:03:19.690> eyes

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
it in attack mode and then and then I

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.670 
it in attack mode and then and then I
flip<00:03:35.230> over<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:35.680> my<00:03:35.830> sand<00:03:36.250> gun<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.780> can<00:03:38.110> go

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
flip over on my sand gun so I can go

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.750 
flip over on my sand gun so I can go
into<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.160> battle

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
into a battle

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.990 
into a battle
so<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:41.050> attacked<00:03:41.500> not<00:03:41.800> realizing<00:03:42.490> that<00:03:42.520> he<00:03:42.700> has

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so I attacked not realizing that he has

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.830 
so I attacked not realizing that he has
mirror<00:03:43.330> force<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.890> then<00:03:45.100> all<00:03:46.030> my<00:03:46.240> monsters<00:03:46.420> get

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
mirror force so then all my monsters get

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.199 
mirror force so then all my monsters get
destroyed<00:03:47.170> unfortunately<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.060> guess

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209
