00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.879 

you<00:00:00.710> too<00:00:01.069> this<00:00:01.550> is<00:00:01.730> MZ<00:00:02.060> unleashed<00:00:02.659> and<00:00:03.529> I'm

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:03.889 
you too this is MZ unleashed and I'm

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.560 
you too this is MZ unleashed and I'm
going<00:00:04.069> to<00:00:04.100> show<00:00:04.310> you<00:00:04.370> how<00:00:04.520> to<00:00:04.700> make<00:00:04.910> floating

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.570 
going to show you how to make floating

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.169 
going to show you how to make floating
sand<00:00:06.050> like<00:00:06.350> this<00:00:07.629> clothing<00:00:08.629> sand<00:00:08.990> or<00:00:09.759> gravel<00:00:10.759> I

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
sand like this clothing sand or gravel I

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.780 
sand like this clothing sand or gravel I
guess<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:13.179> it's<00:00:14.179> a<00:00:14.299> sand<00:00:14.659> or<00:00:15.530> gravel<00:00:16.930> generator

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
guess so it's a sand or gravel generator

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:26.400 
guess so it's a sand or gravel generator
also<00:00:19.790> not<00:00:20.690> just<00:00:21.050> flow<00:00:21.530> so<00:00:24.190> go<00:00:25.190> look<00:00:25.340> like<00:00:25.760> that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
also not just flow so go look like that

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.640 
also not just flow so go look like that
so<00:00:27.410> I'll<00:00:28.280> fall<00:00:28.610> over<00:00:28.640> here<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.420> we<00:00:30.230> can<00:00:30.440> make

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
so I'll fall over here and we can make

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.310 
so I'll fall over here and we can make
our<00:00:30.890> own<00:00:30.920> little<00:00:31.460> thing<00:00:31.660> so<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.050> want<00:00:33.230> to

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
our own little thing so you want to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.300 
our own little thing so you want to
start<00:00:33.350> out<00:00:33.740> with<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.490> the<00:00:35.090> hole<00:00:35.329> in<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.570> ground

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
start out with is the hole in the ground

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.520 
start out with is the hole in the ground
beside<00:00:37.310> it<00:00:37.790> at<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.239> lever<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.970> then<00:00:41.530> continue

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
beside it at the lever and then continue

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.229 
beside it at the lever and then continue
got<00:00:42.739> wire<00:00:43.239> just<00:00:44.239> like<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.730> then<00:00:46.910> put<00:00:47.210> a

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
got wire just like that and then put a

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.400 
got wire just like that and then put a
sticky<00:00:47.570> piston<00:00:47.840> down<00:00:48.230> with<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:50.899> in<00:00:51.110> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
sticky piston down with this so it in a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.549 
sticky piston down with this so it in a
rock<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.399> it<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.640> look<00:00:52.760> like<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.570> this<00:00:54.500> is

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
rock so it to look like this and this is

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.229 
rock so it to look like this and this is
how<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.100> make<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.399> really<00:00:56.030> fast<00:00:58.239> redstone

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
how to make a really fast redstone

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
how to make a really fast redstone
charge<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.170> like<00:01:00.380> it<00:01:00.829> goes<00:01:01.010> on<00:01:01.340> off<00:01:01.610> so<00:01:02.030> fast

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
charge that like it goes on off so fast

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.510 
charge that like it goes on off so fast
that<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.050> can't<00:01:03.469> even<00:01:04.190> see<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.570> go<00:01:05.930> on<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.440> on

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.130 

what<00:01:10.520> will<00:01:10.640> happen<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.120> when<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.450> flick<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.780> it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
what will happen is when you flick it it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.289 
what will happen is when you flick it it
will<00:01:12.950> push<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.210> rock<00:01:14.680> over<00:01:15.680> which<00:01:16.549> will<00:01:16.820> set

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
will push the rock over which will set

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.880 
will push the rock over which will set
off<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:18.799> current<00:01:20.110> which<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.140> make<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.710> go

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
off the current which will make it go

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.000 
off the current which will make it go
back<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.930> will<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:24.229> go<00:01:24.409> back<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.650> forth

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
back and it will just go back and forth

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.719 
back and it will just go back and forth
forever<00:01:25.330> so<00:01:26.330> we<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.460> black

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
forever so we have that and the black

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.380 
forever so we have that and the black
will<00:01:29.000> disappear<00:01:29.659> beginning<00:01:31.000> stand<00:01:32.000> right

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
will disappear beginning stand right

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.260 
will disappear beginning stand right
here<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.530> yeah<00:01:37.390> they<00:01:38.390> make<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.140> then

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
here so yeah they make that and then

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.789 
here so yeah they make that and then
make<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:42.580> continue<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.759> over<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:45.140> put<00:01:45.560> it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
make the continue this over and put it

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.320 
make the continue this over and put it
doesn't<00:01:46.220> matter<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.549> can<00:01:46.580> put<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.000> sticky

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
doesn't matter you can put a sticky

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.859 
doesn't matter you can put a sticky
piston<00:01:47.600> lot<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.080> piston<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:49.520> uh<00:01:49.869> but

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
piston lot of piston and just uh but

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:59.499 
piston lot of piston and just uh but
stand<00:01:51.229> up<00:01:53.799> 123456789<00:01:57.400> thank<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.909> doesn't

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
stand up 123456789 thank you it doesn't

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.510 
stand up 123456789 thank you it doesn't
matter<00:01:59.630> how<00:02:00.049> many<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.470> put<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:00.950> long<00:02:01.159> as<00:02:01.310> it's

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
matter how many you put as long as it's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090 
matter how many you put as long as it's
only<00:02:01.790> 20<00:02:02.210> because<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.869> black<00:02:03.140> pushing<00:02:03.770> limit

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
only 20 because the black pushing limit

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.859 
only 20 because the black pushing limit
I<00:02:04.280> think<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:04.850> funny<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:07.030> once<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.209> turn<00:02:08.660> that

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
I think it's funny so once you turn that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.969 
I think it's funny so once you turn that
yeah<00:02:09.349> I've<00:02:09.770> put<00:02:10.190> too<00:02:10.610> much

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
yeah I've put too much

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.470 
yeah I've put too much
down<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:14.250> I'll<00:02:14.459> turn<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.879> off<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.400> yeah<00:02:18.120> just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
down so I'll turn that off so yeah just

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.890 
down so I'll turn that off so yeah just
put<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.930> around<00:02:19.080> 10<00:02:20.120> lakhs<00:02:21.120> or<00:02:21.480> something<00:02:21.840> like

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
put it around 10 lakhs or something like

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.589 
put it around 10 lakhs or something like
that<00:02:23.870> that's<00:02:24.870> enough<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.209> I'll<00:02:27.390> just

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
that that's enough and then I'll just

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.570 
that that's enough and then I'll just
push<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.930> bunch<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.709> generator

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
push it bunch and it's also a generator

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.860 
push it bunch and it's also a generator
because<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.730> more<00:02:36.060> blocks<00:02:36.480> than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
because you see we have more blocks than

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.910 
because you see we have more blocks than
before<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:39.329> get<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.459> loving<00:02:41.459> sand<00:02:41.970> blocks

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
before and you get to loving sand blocks

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.759 
before and you get to loving sand blocks
so<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:46.349> yeah<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:48.599> guess<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> want<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
so so yeah and I guess if you want to

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.789 
so so yeah and I guess if you want to
try<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.099> out<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.959> gravel<00:02:52.970> look<00:02:53.970> any<00:02:54.180> fry<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
try it out with gravel look any fry that

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:04.009 
try it out with gravel look any fry that
so<00:02:56.540> do<00:02:57.540> that<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> once<00:03:03.030> again<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.660> how<00:03:03.959> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so do that so once again this is how to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.759 
so do that so once again this is how to
make<00:03:04.230> floating<00:03:04.769> sand<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.750> also<00:03:07.019> sand

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
make floating sand and it's also sand

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:16.879 
make floating sand and it's also sand
and<00:03:08.069> gravel<00:03:08.340> generator<00:03:14.780> yep<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.109> it's

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
and gravel generator yep and it's

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.550 
and gravel generator yep and it's
generating<00:03:17.669> a<00:03:17.819> lot<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.120> travel<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:22.200> how

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
generating a lot of travel so that's how
