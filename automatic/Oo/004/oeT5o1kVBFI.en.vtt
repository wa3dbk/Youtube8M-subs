00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.890
 The day of death to buy in one and a half hours, everything is ready APA Janiak 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.240
 küpper 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.319
 Passed in March 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.469
 Friday to learn 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.469
 took two days 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.399
 then I write mine 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.829
 small onion 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 These cooked, which still have to be poured 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.260
 I have her about to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 Simmer for 15 minutes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 Okay that's right the market now but are just undirected in the onion 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.240
 tastier in a meeting in Paris for frying and what else 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.770
 However, they are rarely used as vegetables 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 what a pity 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640
 okay it starts I cut off the tips from above then namely the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.180
 Onion and the knife 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.250
 and that turns out to be careful in turn 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.840
 Plus, this piece can be big enough to hack it up 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 this way the bulb is hollowed out and that way 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 now comes my little filling and to fill her with it i've considered 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.080
 I never know what would be the best way to curb I can do it fast 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.870
 Deputies plug rosemary grated Parmesan or other cheese something like that 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.830
 Direction I mixed it all up and it's right the first time 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.439
 works and since then it has gotten better and better 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.290
 interested listened to 5 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.300
 then all that has gotten out Klein has hacked rank that's enough 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.960
 the suspicion Herten 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.410
 to strangle a concrete one 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.230
 but you can already comply with that 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.320
 so that everything gets going 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.150
 Northern light Pinch of pepper 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.620
 Ounces of small boats set 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.690
 And already it starts to roots and it stands on these pays 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.170
 then briefly while stirring 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 so that a stalemate 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.080
 Schnati the club too 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.340
 cut into thin slices 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 Rainer Neth 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.480
 Okay, let's go! I've got a couple of Rosemary 2 to 6 of them here 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.979
 Lover page 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.019
 Zilina Dunlop and 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.399
 Schnaitsee once across 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 and they also have a course Marin and Siebel 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.639
 it is the strong Combé 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.639
 all of a sudden everything started to make a fantastic impression 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:27.640
 I have her for you 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 hid very well with onions tolerate do not forget that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.229
 unbeatable team I got her from the bacon 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.200
 in the 1 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.409
 isolated 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.829
 when the onion 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.559
 countless the spectrum 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.949
 now I take the rosemary branches as fast as I now at an angle 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.759
 so that they get the tip 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.699
 and 10 that is now pulling it through the onion 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.049
 just like that 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.809
 So he keeps stuck and it looks great 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.809
 and the bacon pulls into the onion and that's just fine 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.329
 whether a casserole dish 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.899
 on top of that St 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.569
 and the next onion 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.759
 I had to say that is totally cool budgeting to buy the band when I am 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.799
 which from the beginning on the music of the I do not want to hit me now 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.589
 but 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.199
 that's kind of crazy 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.109
 that I cook for the boys now 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.109
 I think that will be a really good day for all of us 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.509
 okay they would have too 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.919
 now comes the filling 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.309
 For that, I recognize Double 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.709
 definitely about 6 to 8 it weighs 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.139
 just to see the whole thing 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.429
 bring together different flavors 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.789
 This can pull first OK and now I need 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.249
 to be in Parma 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.289
 you just have two handfuls of this cheese 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:42.849
 and Dr 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.679
 Goes well with the onions, I serve these ten conspirators 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.369
 Pigs can be mainly because of 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.319
 for example, a delicious french fries salad with these onions if they are 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.739
 nice crunchy and Golden are then knows there is a dream, believe me 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.899
 the price increases if he gets you a little hungry 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.579
 now a bit of cheese files 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.989
 short by worms 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.419
 lb 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.419
 between sticky 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 that is the filling 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.069
 Basically, all these tastes are the goals and goals 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.379
 that makes it so delicious 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.430
 perfect if it is only now to the taste of the plug too 

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:27.669
 const 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.580
 since I discovered these topics they are getting better and better I like them often 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.419
 to care 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.939
 now there are a few more 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.259
 from these places about it 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.699
 and then Polly came "to be mighty proud 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.430
 and that was perfectly the best civil court in the world and if that is now 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.849
 the crotch goes back to the crust and the cheese on top 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:46.610
 golden brown 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.840
 These are not unbeatably delicious, according to Keller Keller force as I place 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.970
 Now just set aside 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.340
 until I have prepared the Yorkshire portion and then I can do both 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.560
 same time push in if I make the meat out of Rulle then it already works 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.680
 on the home straight everything clear you just want well Oh by the way I have 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.860
 Jacqueline persuades 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.409
 to take the jaunt together with me
