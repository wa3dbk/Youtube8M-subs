the system featured a great lineup of

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.390 

I<00:03:39.090> wanted<00:03:40.090> Dreamcast<00:03:40.629> to<00:03:40.870> be<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.439> competitive

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
I wanted Dreamcast to be a competitive

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.940 
I wanted Dreamcast to be a competitive
system<00:03:42.900> against<00:03:43.900> PlayStation<00:03:44.409> I<00:03:44.500> wanted<00:03:44.829> to

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
system against PlayStation I wanted to

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.849 
system against PlayStation I wanted to
have<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.819> online<00:03:46.329> multi-player<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.769> I

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
have the online multi-player because I

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.789 
have the online multi-player because I
knew<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.659> Sony<00:03:49.659> was<00:03:50.109> going<00:03:50.469> to<00:03:50.530> lag<00:03:50.769> behind

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
knew that Sony was going to lag behind

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.759 
knew that Sony was going to lag behind
in<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.819> area<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.840> felt<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:53.620> would

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
in that area and I felt that then would

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.759 
in that area and I felt that then would
be<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.159> differentiation<00:03:55.170> between<00:03:56.170> those<00:03:56.590> two

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
be the differentiation between those two

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.240 
be the differentiation between those two
systems<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.370> believe<00:03:57.909> that<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.659> then<00:03:58.840> take

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
systems I believe that would then take

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.309 
systems I believe that would then take
Sega<00:04:00.250> back<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.970> be<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.269> lead<00:04:01.420> company<00:04:01.930> because

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
Sega back to be the lead company because

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.530 
Sega back to be the lead company because
I<00:04:02.409> knew<00:04:02.530> Nintendo<00:04:03.099> didn't<00:04:04.030> want<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.269> get<00:04:04.359> into

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
I knew Nintendo didn't want to get into

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.210 
I knew Nintendo didn't want to get into
that<00:04:04.629> battle<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.170> thought<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.650> launch<00:04:05.950> and

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
that battle I thought the launch and

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.619 
that battle I thought the launch and
still<00:04:06.430> think<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.730> launch<00:04:07.000> was<00:04:07.209> one<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
still think the launch was one of the

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.449 
still think the launch was one of the
best<00:04:07.900> product<00:04:08.620> launches<00:04:09.040> I'd<00:04:09.189> have<00:04:09.310> been

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
best product launches I'd have been

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.300 
best product launches I'd have been
