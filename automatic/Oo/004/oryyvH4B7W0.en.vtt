00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.540
 step by step we start as always 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.529
 our manicure with a base for 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.529
 protect our nail 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.760
 of the base as the equal rank of katrin 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.350
 we can find them in beauty stores 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.059

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.850

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.519
 to the store 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 it's a very bright black with a lot 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.210
 you are blue 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.259
 trimmed with scissors so many strips of 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.350
 Sun as you do not need in this case I'm going 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.970
 to use one for each claw we can 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.560
 find this type of paper in stores 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.600
 of crafts and if we do not have 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.520
 glue for fault we can get away 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.000
 with shine for nails in the absence of bread 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.000
 good are cakes 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 deposited a few drops of glue to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 foil and with the help of a Sunday a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.840
 toothpick helps me 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.229
 draw the light-face effect that I want 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.229
 my nail 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 and a minute after the glue 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 for folk it has become transparent 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.810
 let's go to the effect we apply rough and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 As tips I say for a better finish 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.099
 of this manicure it is preferable to put two 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.680
 layers of these code because he tends to 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.370
 detaching and being well sealed does not give 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.370
 no problem 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 and they were ready for the envy that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.709
 this manicure appeared to me the truth 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.659
 that I love are very easy to do and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.090
 the truth is that it is a very very result 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.360
 pimp do not forget the little finger up 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.360
 like and what happens is a wonderful day 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 goodbye
