00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.679 

so<00:00:02.249> here<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.489> have<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> problem<00:00:02.969> we<00:00:03.269> are<00:00:03.299> trying

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so here we have a problem we are trying

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.469 
so here we have a problem we are trying
to<00:00:03.899> determine<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:05.100> empirical<00:00:05.549> formula<00:00:05.729> of<00:00:06.359> a

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:06.479 
to determine the empirical formula of a

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.419 
to determine the empirical formula of a
compound<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.990> contains<00:00:07.109> carbon<00:00:07.859> hydrogen

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
compound that contains carbon hydrogen

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.470 
compound that contains carbon hydrogen
and<00:00:08.759> oxygen<00:00:09.170> and<00:00:10.670> it's<00:00:11.670> being<00:00:11.940> determined<00:00:12.389> by

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and oxygen and it's being determined by

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.900 
and oxygen and it's being determined by
what's<00:00:12.690> known<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> combustion<00:00:13.530> analysis<00:00:14.190> so

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
what's known as a combustion analysis so

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.520 
what's known as a combustion analysis so
combustion<00:00:15.330> analysis<00:00:15.809> means<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.290> our

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
combustion analysis means that our

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.650 
combustion analysis means that our
compound<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.100> question<00:00:17.520> which<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.360> this<00:00:18.450> case

contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.540 
contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen of
unknown<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> formula<00:00:23.420> is<00:00:24.420> giving<00:00:24.870> us<00:00:25.550> we're

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
unknown the formula is giving us we're

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
unknown the formula is giving us we're
trying<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.760> figure<00:00:26.850> out<00:00:26.940> XY<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> z<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:27.950> so<00:00:28.950> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
trying to figure out XY and z are so a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
trying to figure out XY and z are so a
combustion<00:00:29.610> analysis<00:00:32.120> was<00:00:33.120> burned<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:33.989> our

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
combustion analysis was burned as our

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.569 
combustion analysis was burned as our
indication<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.649> its<00:00:34.800> combustion<00:00:35.100> analysis

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
indication that its combustion analysis

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.540 
indication that its combustion analysis
means<00:00:36.089> that<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.420> reacted<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.899> oxygen<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
means that we reacted with oxygen and it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.329 
means that we reacted with oxygen and it
forms<00:00:39.079> water<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:42.140> carbon<00:00:43.140> dioxide<00:00:43.339> obviously

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
forms water and carbon dioxide obviously

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.500 
forms water and carbon dioxide obviously
we<00:00:44.429> can't<00:00:44.640> balance<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> chemical<00:00:45.359> equation

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
we can't balance this chemical equation

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.700 
we can't balance this chemical equation
because<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.929> don't<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.199> an<00:00:46.320> x<00:00:46.499> y&amp;z<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
because we don't know an x y&amp;z are and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
because we don't know an x y&amp;z are and
we<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.460> idea<00:00:50.489> how<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.149> oxygen<00:00:51.469> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
we also have no idea how much oxygen was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.329 
we also have no idea how much oxygen was
reacted<00:00:53.659> what<00:00:54.659> we<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.079> though<00:00:55.109> is<00:00:55.620> we

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
reacted what we do know though is we

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.649 
reacted what we do know though is we
have<00:00:57.440> 0.475<00:00:58.440> grams<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.699> our<00:01:00.059> original

have 0.475 grams of our original

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.930 
have 0.475 grams of our original
substance<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.949> burned<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> formed

substance and it burned and it formed

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.260 
substance and it burned and it formed
point<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:04.170> nine<00:01:04.830> eight<00:01:05.300> grams<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.770> water<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
point two nine eight grams of water and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
point two nine eight grams of water and
all<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.780> hydrogen<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.890> entire<00:01:11.160> reaction

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
all the hydrogen in the entire reaction

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
all the hydrogen in the entire reaction
all<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.290> react<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.980> hydrogen<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> I

all the react all the hydrogen and I
reacted<00:01:14.910> turned<00:01:15.510> into<00:01:15.690> our<00:01:16.110> water<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.090> us

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
reacted turned into our water so for us

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.210 
reacted turned into our water so for us
to<00:01:18.270> calculate<00:01:19.550> mass<00:01:20.550> percent<00:01:21.120> of<00:01:21.540> hydrogen

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
to calculate mass percent of hydrogen

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.400 
to calculate mass percent of hydrogen
that's<00:01:23.220> simply<00:01:23.580> equal<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.120> mass<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
that's simply equal to the mass of

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.500 
that's simply equal to the mass of
hydrogen<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> sample<00:01:29.300> divided<00:01:30.300> by<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
hydrogen in the sample divided by the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.200 
hydrogen in the sample divided by the
mass<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.780> sample<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> mass

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
mass of the sample we know that the mass

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
mass of the sample we know that the mass
of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> samples<00:01:36.750> 0.475<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.270> have

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
of the samples 0.475 and so we just have

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.180 
of the samples 0.475 and so we just have
to<00:01:39.450> figure<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.740> point<00:01:40.980> four

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
to figure out of what of that point four

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.130 
to figure out of what of that point four
seven<00:01:41.400> five<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.910> much<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.600> hydrogen

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
seven five how much of it is hydrogen

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.450 
seven five how much of it is hydrogen
well<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.580> know<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.420> mass<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.010> water<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.340> was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
well we know the mass of water that was

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.640 
well we know the mass of water that was
formed<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.660> know<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.080> have<00:01:49.170> point<00:01:49.410> two

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
formed and so we know we have point two

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.420 
formed and so we know we have point two
nine<00:01:49.890> eight<00:01:50.100> grams<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:51.020> water<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.380> since<00:01:53.220> we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
nine eight grams of water and since we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
nine eight grams of water and since we
know<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:54.540> mass<00:01:55.730> percent<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:57.000> hydrogen<00:01:57.720> in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
know the mass percent of hydrogen in

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
know the mass percent of hydrogen in
water<00:01:59.630> we<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.780> figure<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.080> our<00:02:01.340> grams<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
water we can figure out our grams of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.770 
water we can figure out our grams of
hydrogen<00:02:04.520> from<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.180> were<00:02:06.270> formed<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.690> our

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
hydrogen from that were formed in our

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
hydrogen from that were formed in our
water<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.410> it's<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.740> two<00:02:07.830> nine<00:02:07.980> eight<00:02:08.009> grams

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
water so it's point two nine eight grams

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
water so it's point two nine eight grams
there<00:02:09.090> were<00:02:09.149> no<00:02:09.269> mass<00:02:09.390> percentages<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.109> our

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there were no mass percentages with our

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.959 
there were no mass percentages with our
water<00:02:10.590> whatever<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.609> can<00:02:11.730> figure<00:02:11.879> out

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
water whatever that is we can figure out

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:12.980 
water whatever that is we can figure out
what<00:02:12.239> mass

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
what mass

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.590 
what mass
hydrogen<00:02:13.470> was<00:02:13.860> sort<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> formed<00:02:15.120> well<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
hydrogen was sort of formed well that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.270 
hydrogen was sort of formed well that

our water product is equal to the mass
of<00:02:24.600> hydrogen<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:25.110> our<00:02:25.230> original<00:02:25.380> sample<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.180> it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
of hydrogen in our original sample so it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.730 
of hydrogen in our original sample so it
will<00:02:27.360> give<00:02:27.480> us<00:02:27.510> our<00:02:27.750> mass<00:02:27.990> percent<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
will give us our mass percent of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.430 
will give us our mass percent of
hydrogen<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> mass<00:02:30.990> percent<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.880> carbon<00:02:33.840> in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
hydrogen for a mass percent of carbon in

hydrogen for a mass percent of carbon in
the<00:02:34.680> sample<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.900> need<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.380> essentially

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the sample we need to know essentially

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
the sample we need to know essentially
the<00:02:38.070> same<00:02:38.220> thing<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.520> we<00:02:38.640> did<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.910> mass<00:02:39.090> percent

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the same thing as we did in mass percent

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
the same thing as we did in mass percent
of<00:02:39.480> hydrogen<00:02:39.600> only<00:02:40.320> that's<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.920> mass<00:02:41.190> of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580

of hydrogen only that's the mass of
carbon<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> sample<00:02:42.870> divided<00:02:43.740> by<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.860> mass

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
carbon in the sample divided by the mass

carbon in the sample divided by the mass
of<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.690> sample<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.560> again<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.730> mass<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.450> our

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.430 
of the sample but again the mass of our
sample<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.830> 0.4<00:02:50.580> 75<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.840> case<00:02:52.020> all<00:02:52.320> of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
sample is 0.4 75 now in this case all of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the carbon in our reaction all reacted

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.050 
the carbon in our reaction all reacted
and<00:02:56.850> went<00:02:57.060> into<00:02:57.180> carbon<00:02:57.720> dioxide<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.000> know

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and went into carbon dioxide and I know

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.090 
and went into carbon dioxide and I know
that<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:01.230> had<00:03:02.690> 0.97<00:03:03.690> 2<00:03:03.870> grams<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.830> carbon

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
that we had 0.97 2 grams of carbon

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.450 
that we had 0.97 2 grams of carbon
dioxide<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:06.090> our<00:03:06.420> product<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> since<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.340> of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
dioxide in our product so since all of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.850 
dioxide in our product so since all of
the<00:03:08.550> carbon<00:03:08.940> from<00:03:09.660> our<00:03:09.810> reaction<00:03:10.320> our

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the carbon from our reaction our

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.920 
the carbon from our reaction our
reactant<00:03:11.400> went<00:03:11.910> into<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.300> carbon<00:03:12.540> dioxide

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
reactant went into the carbon dioxide

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.380 
reactant went into the carbon dioxide
and<00:03:13.050> we<00:03:13.110> know<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> mass<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> carbon<00:03:13.890> dioxide

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and we know the mass of carbon dioxide

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.040 
and we know the mass of carbon dioxide
knowing<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:17.580> mass<00:03:17.760> percent<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.240> carbon<00:03:18.540> in

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
knowing the mass percent of carbon in

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.770 
knowing the mass percent of carbon in
co2<00:03:20.030> allows<00:03:21.030> us<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.540> our<00:03:21.980> mass<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.400> carbon

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
co2 allows us to get our mass of carbon

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.420 
co2 allows us to get our mass of carbon
so<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.840> mass<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.260> carbon<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.830> our<00:03:26.010> product

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
so that's mass of carbon in our product

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.850 
so that's mass of carbon in our product
but<00:03:26.820> since<00:03:27.240> all<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.780> carbon<00:03:28.140> from<00:03:28.770> my

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
but since all of the carbon from my

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.200 
but since all of the carbon from my
original<00:03:29.040> reactant<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.760> need<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:29.970> carbon

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
original reactant we need to carbon

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.480 
original reactant we need to carbon
dioxide<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:31.140> mass<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.740> carbon<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.340> our

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
dioxide that mass of carbon in our

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.900 
dioxide that mass of carbon in our
carbon<00:03:32.820> dioxide<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.600> also<00:03:34.460> or<00:03:35.460> is<00:03:35.640> equal<00:03:35.760> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
carbon dioxide is also or is equal to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.550 
carbon dioxide is also or is equal to
the<00:03:36.510> mass<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.690> carbon<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> original

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
the mass of carbon in the original

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.540 
the mass of carbon in the original
sample<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:39.980> knowing<00:03:40.980> your<00:03:41.010> mass<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.340> carbon

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
sample so knowing your mass of carbon

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.860 
sample so knowing your mass of carbon
dioxide<00:03:41.580> we<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.120> forget<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.390> mass<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.660> carbon

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
dioxide we can forget the mass of carbon

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.140 
dioxide we can forget the mass of carbon
in<00:03:43.050> our<00:03:43.140> product<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:44.520> mass<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.820> carbon<00:03:44.850> in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
in our product and the mass of carbon in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.520 
in our product and the mass of carbon in
our<00:03:45.240> product<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.840> equal<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.290> mass<00:03:46.410> of

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
our product is equal to the mass of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.900 
our product is equal to the mass of
carbon<00:03:46.800> in<00:03:46.890> our<00:03:46.980> original<00:03:47.160> reactant<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.820> so

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
carbon in our original reactant and so

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.120 
carbon in our original reactant and so
now<00:03:48.150> we<00:03:48.210> have<00:03:48.420> our<00:03:48.570> mass<00:03:48.750> percent<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.650> carbon

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
now we have our mass percent of carbon

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.360 
now we have our mass percent of carbon
in<00:03:50.460> our<00:03:51.000> original<00:03:51.330> sample<00:03:52.100> now<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> mass

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
in our original sample now a mass

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.540 
in our original sample now a mass
percent<00:03:55.070> oxygen<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.280> gonna<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.460> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
percent oxygen is this gonna be a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.330 
percent oxygen is this gonna be a
slightly<00:03:57.060> Shepard<00:03:57.510> trickier<00:03:57.990> because<00:03:58.560> we

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
slightly Shepard trickier because we

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.640 
slightly Shepard trickier because we
can't<00:03:59.610> say<00:03:59.880> oh<00:03:59.910> look<00:04:00.300> ok<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:01.290> can<00:04:01.410> figure<00:04:01.590> out

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
can't say oh look ok we can figure out

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.800 
can't say oh look ok we can figure out
how<00:04:01.830> much<00:04:02.010> oxygen<00:04:02.460> is<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:03.120> our<00:04:03.210> water<00:04:03.420> product

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
how much oxygen is in our water product

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.910 
how much oxygen is in our water product
and<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.020> can<00:04:04.110> figure<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.290> how<00:04:04.380> much<00:04:04.470> oxygens

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and we can figure out how much oxygens

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.290 
and we can figure out how much oxygens
are<00:04:05.100> covered<00:04:05.370> by<00:04:05.430> oxide<00:04:05.700> product<00:04:05.970> knowing<00:04:06.210> the

are covered by oxide product knowing the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.620 
are covered by oxide product knowing the
masses<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> problem<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:07.860> right<00:04:08.580> there<00:04:08.850> we

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
masses but the problem is right there we

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.720 
masses but the problem is right there we
have<00:04:09.840> no<00:04:10.050> idea<00:04:10.440> how<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:10.710> oxygen<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.520> sort<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
have no idea how much oxygen was sort of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.150 
have no idea how much oxygen was sort of
like<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.180> air<00:04:12.360> some<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.590> oxygen<00:04:13.860> in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
like in the air some of this oxygen in

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.410 
like in the air some of this oxygen in
the<00:04:14.250> water<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.580> carbon<00:04:14.820> dioxide<00:04:14.880> comes

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the water and the carbon dioxide comes

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.990 
the water and the carbon dioxide comes
from<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> oxygen<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.320> original<00:04:16.680> reactant<00:04:17.130> so

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
from the oxygen the original reactant so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.690 
from the oxygen the original reactant so
we<00:04:18.690> can't<00:04:18.989> figure<00:04:19.470> out<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.130> mass<00:04:20.310> percent<00:04:20.640> of

we can't figure out the mass percent of

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.659 
we can't figure out the mass percent of
oxygen<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> our<00:04:21.480> reactant<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.320> know<00:04:22.890> reactant
