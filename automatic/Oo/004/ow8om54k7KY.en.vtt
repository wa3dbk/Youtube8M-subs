all<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.190> cables<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.890> splitter

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
all the cables so you have the splitter

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.759 
all the cables so you have the splitter
jack<00:03:21.150> for<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.480> pc<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.079> here<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.410> go<00:03:22.440> looks

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
jack for the pc so here you go looks

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.670 
jack for the pc so here you go looks
like<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.010> plug<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:24.380> which<00:03:25.380> allows

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
like you plug it in here which allows

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.850 
like you plug it in here which allows
you<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.010> plug<00:03:26.190> into<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.519> mobile<00:03:27.030> connection

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
you to plug into a mobile connection

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.650 
you to plug into a mobile connection
then<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.459> one<00:03:30.060> here<00:03:30.269> as<00:03:30.360> well<00:03:30.480> which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
then you have a one here as well which

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.660 
then you have a one here as well which
is<00:03:30.690> two<00:03:31.019> way<00:03:31.140> splitter<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.799> full<00:03:32.130> microphone

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
is two way splitter one full microphone

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.110 
is two way splitter one full microphone
one<00:03:32.850> for<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.750> green<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.350> pc<00:03:34.709> jacks<00:03:35.120> you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
one for the green for the pc jacks you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.640 
one for the green for the pc jacks you
actually<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> cable<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.410> with<00:03:37.560> the

actually have a cable here with the
inline<00:03:38.040> microphone<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.049> looks<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.320> you

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
inline microphone so it looks like you

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.870 
inline microphone so it looks like you
get<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.709> few<00:03:40.920> different<00:03:41.250> options<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.730> which

is really really cool and then maybe

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.690 
is really really cool and then maybe
like<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.530> charge<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.040> hits<00:03:44.190> i<00:03:44.280> don't<00:03:44.579> actually

guys a and up-to-date diagram of how it

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.640 
guys a and up-to-date diagram of how it
works<00:04:11.450> obviously<00:04:12.450> how<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> install<00:04:13.140> drivers

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
works obviously how to install drivers

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.870 
works obviously how to install drivers
particular<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.280> i<00:04:14.310> think<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.730> a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
particular but i think this is a

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.279 
particular but i think this is a
plug-and-play<00:04:15.180> hitter<00:04:15.690> as<00:04:15.900> well<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.200> can

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
plug-and-play hitter as well as you can

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.560 
plug-and-play hitter as well as you can
/<00:04:16.530> install<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.919> with<00:04:17.010> drivers<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:18.359> have

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
/ install it with drivers to have

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.870 
/ install it with drivers to have
obviously<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.380> maximum<00:04:20.250> benefit<00:04:20.640> from<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
obviously the maximum benefit from the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.580 
obviously the maximum benefit from the
SteelSeries<00:04:21.390> Engine<00:04:21.419> or<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.289> just<00:04:22.409> use

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
SteelSeries Engine or you can just use

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.990 
SteelSeries Engine or you can just use
as<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> plug-and-play<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.760> less

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
as a plug-and-play but have less

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.290 
as a plug-and-play but have less
features<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:24.510> probably<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> same

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
features but probably the same

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.719 
features but probably the same
the<00:04:25.479> sound<00:04:25.720> quality<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.159> actual<00:04:27.430> and

other side the microphone you got a nice

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.510 
other side the microphone you got a nice
thumbprint<00:05:20.530> here<00:05:20.680> she<00:05:20.979> can<00:05:21.069> actually<00:05:21.219> pull

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
thumbprint here she can actually pull

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.459 
thumbprint here she can actually pull
out<00:05:21.669> on<00:05:21.759> this<00:05:21.879> and<00:05:22.120> easily<00:05:22.539> so<00:05:23.020> as<00:05:23.139> you<00:05:23.229> can<00:05:23.319> see

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.149 
it's quite a long whip phone obviously
this<00:05:25.690> does<00:05:25.960> slide<00:05:26.259> away<00:05:26.440> which<00:05:26.710> is<00:05:26.740> obviously

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
this does slide away which is obviously

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.559 
this does slide away which is obviously
very<00:05:27.219> very<00:05:27.639> handy<00:05:27.909> it's<00:05:28.000> one<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.360> things

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
really cool so it's removable as far as

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.300 
really cool so it's removable as far as
the<00:05:40.599> earcups<00:05:41.050> go<00:05:41.229> you<00:05:41.289> can<00:05:41.560> rotate<00:05:41.800> them<00:05:42.219> you

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
the earcups go you can rotate them you

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.879 
the earcups go you can rotate them you
can't<00:05:42.550> lay<00:05:42.759> them<00:05:42.880> flat<00:05:43.199> but<00:05:44.199> you<00:05:44.259> can<00:05:44.500> rotate

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
can't lay them flat but you can rotate

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.260 
can't lay them flat but you can rotate
them<00:05:45.069> a<00:05:45.130> little<00:05:45.250> bit<00:05:45.460> you<00:05:45.550> can<00:05:45.699> rotate<00:05:45.909> them

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
them a little bit you can rotate them

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.180 
them a little bit you can rotate them
inwards<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.779> little<00:05:47.020> bit<00:05:47.110> as<00:05:47.199> well<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:47.620> there's

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
inwards a little bit as well so there's

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.950 
inwards a little bit as well so there's
not<00:05:48.340> too<00:05:48.669> much<00:05:48.880> movement<00:05:49.240> on<00:05:49.509> them<00:05:49.659> that<00:05:49.810> they

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
not too much movement on them that they

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080 
not too much movement on them that they
feel<00:05:50.199> flimsy<00:05:50.500> but<00:05:51.430> they<00:05:51.550> give<00:05:51.699> you<00:05:51.819> a<00:05:51.849> little

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
feel flimsy but they give you a little

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.399 
feel flimsy but they give you a little
bit<00:05:52.180> of<00:05:52.270> movement<00:05:52.419> just<00:05:52.750> for<00:05:52.960> comfortability

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
bit of movement just for comfortability

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.129 
bit of movement just for comfortability
really<00:05:54.039> the<00:05:54.940> actual<00:05:55.270> sides<00:05:55.629> you<00:05:55.900> have<00:05:56.050> to

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
really the actual sides you have to

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.930 
really the actual sides you have to
steal<00:05:56.379> series<00:05:56.680> logo<00:05:56.889> on<00:05:57.340> these<00:05:57.610> little

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
steal series logo on these little

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.700 
steal series logo on these little
notches<00:05:58.090> here<00:05:58.509> and<00:05:58.930> obviously<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.349> can

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
notches here and obviously you can

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.980 
notches here and obviously you can
extend<00:06:00.129> these<00:06:00.310> fully<00:06:00.819> on<00:06:01.029> both<00:06:01.270> sides<00:06:01.599> very

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
extend these fully on both sides very

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.559 
extend these fully on both sides very
very<00:06:02.800> easily<00:06:03.180> obviously<00:06:04.180> but<00:06:04.300> they're<00:06:04.449> not

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
very easily obviously but they're not

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.540 
very easily obviously but they're not
too<00:06:04.840> loose<00:06:05.080> today<00:06:05.469> just<00:06:05.680> come<00:06:05.949> down<00:06:06.190> when<00:06:06.219> they

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
too loose today just come down when they

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.670 
too loose today just come down when they
don't<00:06:06.699> win<00:06:07.029> the<00:06:07.120> not<00:06:07.240> meant<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:07.599> on<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.349> top<00:06:08.529> on

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
don't win the not meant to on the top on

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.809 
don't win the not meant to on the top on
the<00:06:08.710> headband<00:06:09.099> you<00:06:09.190> have<00:06:09.279> the<00:06:09.400> steel<00:06:09.580> series

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
the headband you have the steel series

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.450 
the headband you have the steel series
logo<00:06:10.120> with<00:06:10.930> some<00:06:11.169> very<00:06:11.319> nice<00:06:11.560> little<00:06:11.919> for<00:06:12.159> pads

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
logo with some very nice little for pads

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.189 
logo with some very nice little for pads
here<00:06:12.699> as<00:06:12.819> well<00:06:12.940> they<00:06:13.150> made<00:06:13.330> look<00:06:13.569> different<00:06:13.960> a

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
here as well they made look different a

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.499 
here as well they made look different a
different<00:06:14.710> hit<00:06:15.219> band<00:06:15.460> he<00:06:15.669> obviously<00:06:15.909> is<00:06:16.090> four

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
different hit band he obviously is four

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.760 
different hit band he obviously is four
different<00:06:16.900> pads<00:06:17.080> rather<00:06:17.409> than<00:06:17.590> one

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
different pads rather than one

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.189 
different pads rather than one
continuous<00:06:18.370> pads<00:06:18.669> definitely<00:06:19.569> improves<00:06:19.960> on

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
continuous pads definitely improves on

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.110 
continuous pads definitely improves on
the<00:06:20.379> design<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.979> would<00:06:21.129> say<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:21.849> on<00:06:22.029> the

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
the design I would say and on the

guys<00:06:41.020> my<00:06:41.260> full<00:06:41.620> review<00:06:41.860> I'm<00:06:42.370> also<00:06:42.520> going<00:06:42.730> to

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
guys my full review I'm also going to

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.310 
guys my full review I'm also going to
test<00:06:43.090> them<00:06:43.240> out<00:06:43.300> of<00:06:43.450> music<00:06:43.810> as<00:06:43.930> well<00:06:44.020> because<00:06:44.260> I

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
test them out of music as well because I

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.300 
test them out of music as well because I
think<00:06:44.500> something<00:06:44.800> like<00:06:44.920> this<00:06:44.980> would<00:06:45.130> be

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
think something like this would be

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.550 
think something like this would be
absolutely<00:06:45.640> incredible<00:06:46.360> with<00:06:46.900> music<00:06:47.320> as<00:06:47.440> well

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
absolutely incredible with music as well

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.750 
absolutely incredible with music as well
and<00:06:47.710> they<00:06:47.770> actually<00:06:47.860> look<00:06:48.190> like<00:06:48.220> a<00:06:48.460> heads<00:06:48.640> that

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.910 
and they actually look like a heads that
you<00:06:48.880> could<00:06:49.030> even<00:06:49.150> just<00:06:49.420> take<00:06:49.660> out<00:06:49.870> and<00:06:50.470> wear<00:06:50.710> as

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920 
you could even just take out and wear as

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.100
