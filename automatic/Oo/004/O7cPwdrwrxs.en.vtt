00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

I<00:00:00.170> just<00:00:01.170> started<00:00:01.410> playing<00:00:01.680> with<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:02.010> d7000

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I just started playing with the d7000

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.610 
I just started playing with the d7000
and<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.389> wanted<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.720> document<00:00:03.899> something<00:00:04.350> kind

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
and I wanted to document something kind

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.920 
and I wanted to document something kind
of<00:00:04.680> interesting<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.220> found<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:06.450> Live

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
of interesting that I found about Live

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.820 
of interesting that I found about Live
View<00:00:07.170> mode<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:08.750> capture<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.650> I'm<00:00:10.710> in

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
View mode and video capture so I'm in

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.440 
View mode and video capture so I'm in
manual<00:00:11.190> mode<00:00:11.219> right<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:14.120> we're<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.210> Live

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
manual mode right now and we're in Live

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.570 
manual mode right now and we're in Live
View<00:00:15.480> mode<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:16.020> well<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.440> you'd<00:00:16.619> expect<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
View mode as well and as you'd expect we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.689 
View mode as well and as you'd expect we
can<00:00:18.109> adjust<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.590> shutter<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.609> pop<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
can adjust the shutter you know pop I

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.500 
can adjust the shutter you know pop I
can<00:00:23.699> adjust<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.439> stops<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.890> 30

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
can adjust it down and it stops at 30

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.169 
can adjust it down and it stops at 30
right<00:00:27.619> okay<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.429> take<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> video<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
right okay so we can take a video and it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
right okay so we can take a video and it
would<00:00:30.269> turn<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.510> pretty<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.710> see

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
would turn out pretty much what we see

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760 
would turn out pretty much what we see
in<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> viewer<00:00:32.989> but<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.530> into

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
in the in the viewer but if we go into

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.200 
in the in the viewer but if we go into
program<00:00:35.670> mode<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> same

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
program mode we start out at the same

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
program mode we start out at the same
place<00:00:43.050> roughly<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> course<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.550> camera

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
place roughly and of course the camera

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
place roughly and of course the camera
is<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> make<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.390> auto<00:00:46.320> adjustments

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is going to make some auto adjustments

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.290 
is going to make some auto adjustments
to<00:00:47.070> exposure<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.640> us<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.500> using<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
to exposure for us but using the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.590 
to exposure for us but using the
exposure<00:00:51.300> variation<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.600> take

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
exposure variation we can actually take

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420 
exposure variation we can actually take
the<00:00:54.750> shutter<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.620> slower<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.070> one

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the shutter much slower than one

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420 
the shutter much slower than one
thirtieth<00:00:57.680> take<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
thirtieth take it all the way down to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
thirtieth take it all the way down to
1.3<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:02.420> set<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.449> aperture<00:01:03.719> higher<00:01:03.960> we

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
1.3 and if we set our aperture higher we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.450 
1.3 and if we set our aperture higher we
can<00:01:04.320> even<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.680> even<00:01:05.780> even<00:01:06.780> slower<00:01:07.080> than<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
can even go even even slower than that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
can even go even even slower than that
now<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.909> autumn<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:10.020> here

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
now just kind of autumn and see here

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.890 
now just kind of autumn and see here
we're<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.350> ISO<00:01:11.570> ISO<00:01:12.570> 200<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.720> what's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
we're at ISO ISO 200 and so what's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.039 
we're at ISO ISO 200 and so what's
interesting<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.590> though<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:18.049> if

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
interesting about this though is that if

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.490 
interesting about this though is that if
we're<00:01:20.990> stopped<00:01:21.990> down<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.100> F<00:01:23.700> 20<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> shutter

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
we're stopped down to F 20 at a shutter

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.499 
we're stopped down to F 20 at a shutter
speed<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:26.360> 1.3<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.680> expect<00:01:29.070> our

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
speed of 1.3 we would expect our

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.319 
speed of 1.3 we would expect our
resulting<00:01:30.509> video<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.079> very<00:01:31.380> blurry<00:01:32.060> as<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
resulting video to be very blurry as we

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
resulting video to be very blurry as we
insert<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.200> motion<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> let's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
insert a little motion here so let's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.109 
insert a little motion here so let's
just<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> couple<00:01:36.630> pans<00:01:37.020> we'll<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:38.119> make

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
just do a couple pans we'll make make

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
just do a couple pans we'll make make
them<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> quick<00:01:40.820> all<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.680> stop

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
them kind of quick all right and we stop

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
them kind of quick all right and we stop
recording<00:01:45.530> go<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> playback<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:50.060> what<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.210> see

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
recording go to playback and what we see

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
recording go to playback and what we see
is<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.950> expect<00:01:55.399> all<00:01:56.399> right<00:01:56.750> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
is not what we expect all right so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.010 
is not what we expect all right so
really<00:01:58.170> no<00:01:58.439> blur<00:01:58.820> no<00:01:59.820> jello<00:02:00.240> effect<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.869> mean

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
really no blur no jello effect I mean

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
really no blur no jello effect I mean
that<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.799> 1.3<00:02:02.490> 1.6<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.680> I'd<00:02:04.680> even<00:02:04.829> done

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that was at 1.3 1.6 and I'd even done

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.490 
that was at 1.3 1.6 and I'd even done
this<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.600> second<00:02:07.020> two<00:02:07.140> second

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this at like with one second two second

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.150 
this at like with one second two second
three<00:02:07.530> second<00:02:08.069> shutter<00:02:08.220> settings<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:10.160> it's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
three second shutter settings and it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
three second shutter settings and it's
not<00:02:11.370> matching<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.849> conventional

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
not matching the conventional

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.940 
not matching the conventional
expectation<00:02:13.620> of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
expectation of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
expectation of
it<00:02:14.040> would<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:15.090> those<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.569> shutter

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
it would do at those kind of shutter

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.420 
it would do at those kind of shutter
speeds<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.379> would<00:02:16.500> expect<00:02:16.830> lots<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.250> blur

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
speeds you would expect lots of blur

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.250 
speeds you would expect lots of blur
lots<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> shadow<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.360> lots<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.660> ghosting<00:02:19.080> kind

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
lots of shadow and lots of ghosting kind

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.890 
lots of shadow and lots of ghosting kind
of<00:02:19.319> effect<00:02:19.620> let's<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> javo<00:02:20.099> effect<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:21.690> really

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
of effect let's a javo effect but really

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.880 
of effect let's a javo effect but really
don't<00:02:22.019> see<00:02:22.319> any<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:24.709> pull<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.800> over

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
don't see any of that if we pull it over

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.750 
don't see any of that if we pull it over
here<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.550> light<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.150> actually<00:02:28.760> do

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
here into the light we can actually do

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600 
here into the light we can actually do
it<00:02:29.879> even<00:02:30.090> even<00:02:30.300> crazier<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.560> we're<00:02:31.709> at<00:02:31.769> f21

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it even even crazier so we're at f21

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.780 
it even even crazier so we're at f21
eight<00:02:32.910> shutter<00:02:33.510> speed<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.190> let's<00:02:35.190> dial<00:02:35.640> in

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
eight shutter speed and let's dial in

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.440 
eight shutter speed and let's dial in
some<00:02:35.970> exposure<00:02:36.330> compensation<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:38.450> now

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
some exposure compensation here and now

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.210 
some exposure compensation here and now
we're<00:02:39.660> talking<00:02:40.380> shutter<00:02:40.590> speeds<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.040> like

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
we're talking shutter speeds of like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890 
we're talking shutter speeds of like
three<00:02:41.519> seconds<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.000> here's<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.299> three<00:02:42.540> second

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
three seconds so here's a three second

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.470 
three seconds so here's a three second
shutter<00:02:43.080> speed<00:02:43.700> same<00:02:44.700> result<00:02:45.090> would<00:02:45.209> start

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
shutter speed same result would start

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
shutter speed same result would start
recording<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.540> we'll<00:02:48.660> pull<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.319> in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
recording and we'll pull it in and in

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.979 
recording and we'll pull it in and in
program<00:02:50.640> auto<00:02:51.000> mode<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.599> going<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.840> go

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
program auto mode it's going to go

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
program auto mode it's going to go
higher<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:52.829> went<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.069> four<00:02:53.280> second

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
higher you see we went to four second

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.569 
higher you see we went to four second
five<00:02:54.829> second<00:02:55.829> four<00:02:55.980> second<00:02:56.340> shutter<00:02:56.489> speed

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
five second four second shutter speed

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.420 
five second four second shutter speed
there<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.299> it's<00:02:58.049> even<00:02:58.319> as<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.769> light<00:02:59.190> gets

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
there and it's even as the light gets

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
there and it's even as the light gets
less<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.819> less<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.090> even<00:03:00.360> going<00:03:00.569> higher

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
less and less it's even going higher

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.460 
less and less it's even going higher
than<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.079> now<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> says<00:03:01.560> low<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> we're

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
than that now it says low so we're

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.580 
than that now it says low so we're
talking<00:03:04.769> about<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:06.260> shutter<00:03:07.260> speed<00:03:07.470> in

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
talking about you know shutter speed in

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.780 
talking about you know shutter speed in
the<00:03:08.040> seconds<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:10.140> when<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:10.980> look<00:03:11.160> at<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.489> play

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the seconds but when we look at it play

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:24.379 
the seconds but when we look at it play
it<00:03:11.910> back<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:20.220> don't<00:03:20.400> really<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:23.030> any<00:03:24.030> kind

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
it back and we don't really see any kind

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.870 
it back and we don't really see any kind
of<00:03:24.799> detriment<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.670> video

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
of detriment to the to the video

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.400 
of detriment to the to the video
actually<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.420> mean<00:03:27.510> there's<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.840> even<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.109> jello

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
actually I mean there's not even a jello

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.390 
actually I mean there's not even a jello
effect<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:30.109> I'm<00:03:31.109> kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.500> wondering<00:03:34.400> what's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
effect so I'm kind of wondering what's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
effect so I'm kind of wondering what's
going<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.700> here<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> mean<00:03:36.000> there's<00:03:36.150> got<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.389> be

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
going on here I mean there's got to be

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
going on here I mean there's got to be
some<00:03:36.720> other<00:03:36.840> we're<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:37.380> adjusting<00:03:37.829> ISO

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
some other we're not adjusting ISO

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.979 
some other we're not adjusting ISO
there's<00:03:39.150> got<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.359> be<00:03:39.389> some<00:03:39.540> other<00:03:39.600> kind<00:03:39.900> of

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
there's got to be some other kind of

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.080 
there's got to be some other kind of
gain<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.260> some<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.040> something<00:03:41.670> else<00:03:41.850> that

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
gain or some kind of something else that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.440 
gain or some kind of something else that
the<00:03:42.180> camera<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.660> doing<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:45.060> keep<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:47.450> know

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the camera is doing to keep it you know

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
the camera is doing to keep it you know
to<00:03:48.569> keep<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.959> good<00:03:49.319> image<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.769> obviously

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
to keep a good image now obviously

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.530 
to keep a good image now obviously
there's<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.819> be<00:03:50.910> some<00:03:51.120> noise<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.420> there

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
there's going to be some noise and there

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.460 
there's going to be some noise and there
somewhere<00:03:51.870> there's<00:03:52.019> got<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.230> something

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
somewhere there's got to be something

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.930 
somewhere there's got to be something
going<00:03:52.680> on<00:03:52.829> but<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.100> anybody<00:03:53.400> has<00:03:53.519> any<00:03:53.670> thoughts

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
going on but if anybody has any thoughts

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.390 
going on but if anybody has any thoughts
on<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.150> I'd<00:03:55.019> love<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.319> hear<00:03:55.410> because<00:03:55.560> I'm<00:03:56.370> a
