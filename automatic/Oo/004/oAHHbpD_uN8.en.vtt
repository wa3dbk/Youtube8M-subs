00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
was a surprise but without doubt it was

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.979 
was a surprise but without doubt it was
very<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.910> exciting<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> teams

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
very very exciting I think the teams

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.830 
very very exciting I think the teams
only<00:00:43.140> had<00:00:43.379> limited<00:00:43.710> number<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> spots<00:00:44.840> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
only had limited number of spots you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
only had limited number of spots you
know<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.200> season<00:00:46.860> 1<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> season<00:00:47.219> 2

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
know it's not like season 1 and season 2

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670 
know it's not like season 1 and season 2
where<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.570> had<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> larger<00:00:49.079> number<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.379> spots

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
where we had a larger number of spots

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.959 
where we had a larger number of spots
and<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.920> larger<00:00:50.129> number<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.370> purse<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.760> think

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and a larger number of purse I think

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
and a larger number of purse I think
we're<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.600> happy<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.079> happened<00:00:52.610> well

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
we're very happy with what happened well

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
we're very happy with what happened well
is<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:53.969> obvious<00:00:54.539> question<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.989> everybody

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.959 
is one obvious question that everybody
is<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.980> asking<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> fact

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
is going to be asking you is the fact

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
is going to be asking you is the fact
that<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.510> didn't<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.079> single

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that could be with the fact that you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
that could be with the fact that you
know<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> lot<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.660> were<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.930> available

even<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.680> were<00:01:50.509> very<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.840> players

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
even if they were very very good players

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
even if they were very very good players
and<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> player<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> 100%

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and if you look at the player that 100%

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
and if you look at the player that 100%
available<00:01:54.649> there<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:56.040> were<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
available there and they were good and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
available there and they were good and
had<00:01:57.509> potential<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> become<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:59.340> were

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
had potential to become better they were

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
had potential to become better they were
snapped<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.030> huge<00:02:00.270> prices<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.530> think

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
snapped up at huge prices and I think

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
snapped up at huge prices and I think
the<00:02:02.219> or<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.850> people<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.780> realizing<00:02:04.229> more

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the or that is people are realizing more

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660 
the or that is people are realizing more
and<00:02:04.439> more<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:05.009> want<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:05.369> teams<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and more that they want their teams to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
and more that they want their teams to
be<00:02:05.759> consistent<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> their

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
be consistent and they and their

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.260 
be consistent and they and their
performance<00:02:08.220> needs<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.550> consistent<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
performance needs to be consistent and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
performance needs to be consistent and
they<00:02:09.720> need<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.080> made<00:02:10.259> available<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they need to be made available and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.450 
they need to be made available and
that's<00:02:11.280> why

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
that's why

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.370 
that's why
happen<00:02:11.820> people<00:02:12.450> would<00:02:12.570> pay<00:02:12.750> more<00:02:12.960> for<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.260> at

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
happen people would pay more for that at

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
happen people would pay more for that at
the<00:02:13.470> end<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.740> day<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.460> if<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:14.940> meet

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
