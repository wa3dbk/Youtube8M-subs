we've got the MagSafe power connector
this<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.949> Gigabit<00:00:18.609> Ethernet<00:00:18.760> port<00:00:19.769> we

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
this is the Gigabit Ethernet port we

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.490 
this is the Gigabit Ethernet port we

backup Time Machine and then we have the

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.420 
backup Time Machine and then we have the
mini<00:00:29.530> DisplayPort

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430

just<00:00:33.789> a<00:00:34.000> second<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:34.870> have<00:00:34.989> two<00:00:35.170> USB<00:00:35.410> 2.0<00:00:36.399> ports

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
just a second we have two USB 2.0 ports

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.270 
just a second we have two USB 2.0 ports
I<00:00:36.910> wish<00:00:37.059> there<00:00:37.239> were<00:00:37.329> 3.0<00:00:38.039> because<00:00:39.039> this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
I wish there were 3.0 because this

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.889 
I wish there were 3.0 because this
Thunderbolt<00:00:39.850> port<00:00:40.149> is<00:00:40.329> not<00:00:40.479> going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.659> be<00:00:40.749> that

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
Thunderbolt port is not going to be that

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.340 
Thunderbolt port is not going to be that
useful<00:00:41.159> until<00:00:42.269> accessories<00:00:43.269> come<00:00:43.510> out<00:00:43.690> and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
useful until accessories come out and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.169 
useful until accessories come out and
then<00:00:44.440> we<00:00:44.530> have<00:00:44.649> here<00:00:44.859> an<00:00:44.949> SD<00:00:45.309> card<00:00:45.339> slot

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
then we have here an SD card slot

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.700 
then we have here an SD card slot
it's<00:00:46.539> SD<00:00:47.019> h<00:00:47.280> XC<00:00:48.280> compatible<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.839> it<00:00:49.989> can<00:00:50.139> do

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
it's SD h XC compatible so it can do

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's SD h XC compatible so it can do
some<00:00:50.889> pretty<00:00:51.039> fast<00:00:51.819> SD<00:00:52.659> cards<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.079> high

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
some pretty fast SD cards and high

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.770 
some pretty fast SD cards and high
volume<00:00:54.010> cards<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.760> then<00:00:55.210> we've<00:00:55.329> got<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.600> two

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
volume cards and then we've got the two

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.549 
volume cards and then we've got the two
audio<00:00:56.289> ports<00:00:56.889> for<00:00:57.129> line<00:00:57.370> out<00:00:57.609> and<00:00:58.170> line<00:00:59.170> in

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
audio ports for line out and line in

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.039 
audio ports for line out and line in
they<00:01:00.280> also<00:01:00.429> work<00:01:00.760> as<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.969> mic<00:01:01.239> in<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.719> a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
they also work as a mic in and a

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.950 
they also work as a mic in and a

forward<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.540> being<00:01:26.140> able<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.350> test<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.770> out<00:01:26.890> get

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
forward to being able to test it out get

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.840 
forward to being able to test it out get
some<00:01:28.020> accessories<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.980> can<00:01:30.160> daisy<00:01:30.670> chain

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
some accessories in you can daisy chain

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.090 
some accessories in you can daisy chain
some<00:01:31.390> accessories<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.170> could<00:01:32.410> plug<00:01:32.620> in<00:01:32.920> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
some accessories so you could plug in a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.820 
some accessories so you could plug in a
hard<00:01:34.000> drive<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.600> then<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> port<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.650> hard

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
hard drive and then the port on the hard

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.470 
hard drive and then the port on the hard
drive<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.100> could<00:01:36.340> plug<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> monitor<00:01:37.090> into<00:01:37.300> that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
drive you could plug a monitor into that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.330 
drive you could plug a monitor into that
and<00:01:37.750> then<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.680> there's<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.950> port<00:01:39.160> on<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
and then if there's a port on the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.680 
and then if there's a port on the
monitor<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.730> could<00:01:39.970> plug<00:01:40.150> another<00:01:40.420> hard

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
monitor you could plug another hard

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.080 
monitor you could plug another hard
drive<00:01:40.930> in<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.220> hard<00:01:42.640> drive<00:01:42.850> has

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
drive in and then if that hard drive has

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.690 
drive in and then if that hard drive has
a<00:01:43.120> port<00:01:43.540> on<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.410> could<00:01:44.560> plug<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.070> say<00:01:45.430> maybe

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
a port on it you could plug in say maybe

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.460 
a port on it you could plug in say maybe
a<00:01:48.180> docking<00:01:49.180> connector<00:01:49.480> where<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.110> has<00:01:50.260> like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
a docking connector where that has like

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.590 
a docking connector where that has like
USB<00:01:50.800> ports<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.580> Ethernet<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.180> all<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.420> kind

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
USB ports and Ethernet and all that kind

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.390 
USB ports and Ethernet and all that kind
of<00:01:52.630> stuff<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.020> it's<00:01:53.500> possible<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.250> could

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
of stuff so it's possible that you could

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.170 
of stuff so it's possible that you could
plug<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.850> one<00:01:55.150> cable<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:57.100> six<00:01:57.730> eight<00:01:57.909> ten

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
plug in one cable and have six eight ten

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780 
plug in one cable and have six eight ten
twelve<00:01:58.210> devices<00:01:59.140> all<00:01:59.290> working<00:01:59.740> all<00:02:00.070> lit<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.550> at

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
twelve devices all working all lit up at

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.460 
twelve devices all working all lit up at
