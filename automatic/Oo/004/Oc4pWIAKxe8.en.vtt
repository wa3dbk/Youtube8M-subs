00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello today I'm in asturias in particular 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.480
 in the river navia the vertebral axis of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.460
 western Astur despite being a river 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.750
 very domesticated with man goes through 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 also some of the most cannons 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.440
 spectacular of the principality just those 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 I'm going to go kayak today 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030
 i 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.120
 the navia is a very emblematic river has 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.670
 almost 180 kilometers in length born in 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.410
 the ancares de lugo and is regulated by 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.540
 three reservoirs thanks to this is the river 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.370
 perfect for canoeing in a canoe 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.050
 suitable for all types of public 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.580
 Now let's navigate a little bit for the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.500
 main channel and then we're going to 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.500
 put in an affluent in the river golear 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 I'm from moms 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.650
 this is false judgment 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.759
 As you can see we have already left the level of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.009
 marsh water we are already in the river 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.020
 natural for that reason in some points like 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.640
 this and little flow and you have to get off and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 drag it has water but right away 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.430
 we are going to get into the most beautiful part 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.430
 from the irrigation canyon lear 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 we are already in the canyon of the rocks 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.820
 formed the rederos are from the water the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.300
 exceptional landscape the riparian forest 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.650
 an excellent wildlife otters rights 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.280
 real 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.590
 kingfisher dams paradise 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.569
 to the water current already gives us another 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.900
 dynamic here we have to fight against 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.900
 storms 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.070
 yes 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.070
 it's more 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.120
 asturias is usually publicized with the motto 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.850
 natural paradise and the truth is that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.710
 when you browse a site like this 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 you explain why until the next 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.190
 adventure 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190
 is not in service
