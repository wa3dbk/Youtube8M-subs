00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.030
 to see the eight visits here 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.630
 let's do this room 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.390
 we have taken one without eyes from the garden 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.180
 we have collected some long naranjitas 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.740
 the orange that we have there burned 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.230
 some weeds and we are going to compose a 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.480
 salad but the interesting thing about this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.110
 salad in vinaigrette because because 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.430
 let's use the whole oranges 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.190
 With everything and shell you can use 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.080
 any orange type is here they are very 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.280
 aromatic and while more aromatic 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.289
 be better and even washed 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.699
 I believe that with two enough is one 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.680
 small salad that we are going to do not 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.330
 we need a lot of vinaigrette 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.330
 we put to the blender 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.370
 a clove of garlic and gave me some salt 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 vinegar can be an apple cider vinegar 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.350
 it can be a red wine vinegar 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.720
 expedited 2 to 12 d 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.720
 acid oil 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.220
 we go 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.000
 spectacular 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.460
 I have with the time almost no longer 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.640
 sweet the sweetest orange will come out the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.700
 vinaigrette is here was quite acidic 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.780
 It was not very sweet 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.190
 and I prefer it that way 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.190
 wellness vinaigrette 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.900
 ok for salad we have our angers 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.460
 here 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:20.370
 we take the bottom part 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.850
 and as always biting very thin 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.630
 great 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.630
 when 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.540
 we take some 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.459
 spinach 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.300
 it is very crispy tender to see we have 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.750
 these super grapefruits 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.700
 from our friend Juan 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.010
 which are sweet also spectacular is 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.470
 important to consume citrus in the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.060
 winter not only for the good 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.080
 amount of vitamin you may have 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 if not 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.850
 because they have enough antioxidants 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.850
 finished 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.270
 and squeezed from the grapefruit 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.190
 what good looks like that just has a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.300
 terminal pint we go with the vinaigrette a 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.300
 couple of good spoonfuls 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.359
 you have to smell this 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.250
 let's finish with 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.739
 these wonders that we have done makes a 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.569
 You can do a couple of hours 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.080
 previous day they have to do the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.450
 refrigerator too 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.970
 look at this to a show 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.070
 let's finish with 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.070
 these lemon basil flowers 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.410
 these goat 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.410
 It has good 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.470
 and will approve the exchange, I can not stand it anymore
