00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.969
 finds and here's one of the finds 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.010
 this is a fun video player on 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.400
 video cassette recorder 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.350
 in 3rd mk6 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.580
 that's how it looks like its faceplate 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.170
 front 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.020
 Now we are focusing on him 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 screen is made in japan corporate 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:43.550
 video recorder pal secam 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.230
 in general, that's how it looks from above 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 dirty now we open it here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.739
 was worn in such a disassembled floor 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 condition let's see it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.680
 entrails so at first glance that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 we have a customer here broach like all u 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 it is in place so so so so so 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.659
 it looks like a power supply power supply 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.759
 whether collective farm already here at us software depot 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.830
 the item is already coming someone here before me 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.110
 polazil 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 the most interesting thing that did not break off 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.750
 here is this here is the cord here is the video on the spot 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.290
 factory cord so on 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 further further further further let you 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.470
 show the back of it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:46.750
 so the back panel of it is so funai a model 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.229
 The number in the 3rd mk6 fell bg cy кв kd to 240 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.900
 volt 50 60 hertz 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.260
 18 watts power consumption serial 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 the number is made japan so here are the antennas and 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.509
 input / output outputs 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 Well, in principle, everything is so he 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.280
 unpretentious 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.790
 video player writing so here we have 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.840
 on the connector and everything is fine, we try 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.239
 turn it on yet not included therefore not 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.190

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
 reacts 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.510
 it means we have a problem with the power supply 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.230
 We will understand the following video 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.969
