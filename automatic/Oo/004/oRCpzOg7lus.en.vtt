berries before you die so what I

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.190 
berries before you die so what I
recommend<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.420> once<00:02:49.780> you're<00:02:49.930> outside

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
recommend you do is once you're outside

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
recommend you do is once you're outside
the<00:02:50.349> map<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.950> try<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.280> find<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.579> zone<00:02:51.790> where

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the map you try and find a zone where

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.729 
the map you try and find a zone where
there<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.180> no<00:02:52.329> death<00:02:52.510> barrier<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.410> once<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
there is no death barrier so once the
