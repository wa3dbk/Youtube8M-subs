00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.970
 All come armed 

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:04.190
 O my strong soldiers 

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.652
 All come armed 

00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:12.897
 O my strong soldiers 

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.709
 I am the Invitation of Love 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.532
 Right saucer 

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.543
 Not the point 

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:24.761
 But in a beautiful row united 

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.993
 Follow me bold 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.981
 All come armed 

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:00.702
 O my strong soldiers 

00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:07.102
 I am the invitation 

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:08.854
 Right saucer 

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.194
 Do not fear point 

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.658
 But in a beautiful row united 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.198
 But follow daring 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.895
 They look like strong heroes 

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:30.361
 Those who are against you 

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:36.778
 But from those who know how to hurt 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.578
 We don't know how to screen 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.820
 Do not fear point 

00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.336
 But brave and strong 

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.743
 Wise to the pugna 

00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:55.667
 But from those who know how to hurt 

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:57.502
 We don't know how to screen 

00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:59.720
 Do not fear point 

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:02.190
 But brave and strong 

00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.700
 Wise to the pugna
