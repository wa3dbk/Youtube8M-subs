00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.200
 I decided I'll show you how the safe 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 My fringe is I here in the bathroom, I 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 I think it's a better place to cut off. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.050
 here the sink is because it does not make me mess 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.900
 let the hair fall on the pile because I 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 I clean the top not to fall hair 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.720
 it does not even deserve a pint of 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 hair is and then olimpo I made a post 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 a little while ago on my 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 surgery that this tiny line 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 What do I have there on the blog if you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 I want to leave the link here at 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 low and some girls asked to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 make a video showing how to cut the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 hair at home because I said that I 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 I do not like much of us, he said cut 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 preferred to cut and advertise 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 so here my fringe believe 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.649
 Short of believing a little big then 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 I'm going to stop every two 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 weeks I have this stop what I 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 use is a scissors is sure is 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 used to cut 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.950
 Hair is I think perfumery such I 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.610
 I bought it on the team since it was well on 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 title card $ 15 no to scissors 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 those professional nÃ© is only one ink 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.770
 special haircut she has 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.930
 a very sharp cut the ones a relative and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.009
 an organizer because it cuts my 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 front supported 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 the rest of my hair usually cuts 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.420
 dry because as he is very thin his 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.930
 look he heals a lot and I can 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.790
 make head hole 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.210
 but in front of me I like to cut 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 she wet then the first thing that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.180
 I do is tie the hair I'm going to come 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.060
 here's a mirror, but I'll go 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.060
 continue funk blues is the first thing 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.430
 What I do is take care of my hair and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.369
 leaving the fringe is not in danger of 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.580
 get more hair and gather more in the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 fringe and leave a tick sentence here knows 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 so the first thing I do is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.520
 hair in a ponytail to 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.880
 that I can see right where the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.370
 fringe bangs and I'm using it to 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.120
 angel, but so when she brings 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.440
 can even leave the big jack is she with 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.330
 a straight cut but how it grew and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.060
 will grow very disproportionate can 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.800
 to see that even so the valadÃ£o is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 When I cut when I stop to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.750
 left the region then after my 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.400
 hair is already attached and the guarantor case is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.030
 I take a look at the iron 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.790
 now it's wet I'll close well 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.820
 straight like this but straight 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.180
 get there I'll lie to her and 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.180
 I'll finish what's left over, I'll cut 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.950
 despite fringes and straight I do not itch 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.130
 very straight I leave all the time I had 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.100
 I'm going to leave and then I'll 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.170
 kind of a shred I 'll cut through 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.220
 right first and then ours as 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.220
 I make shreds 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.410
 after I cut it at length I 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.690
 I want it to be the last layer I go 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.480
 start skewing first tried to cut 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.510
 more retinha just not be a corner 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.510
 in the river stay poetinha because even because 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.970
 I use it more then a side not 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.640
 made for just cut made me leave 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.150
 pick it up and start doing the 100 years 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.950
 I'm going to cut it like this without paper. 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.890
 hygienic will only do so 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.730
 you had a slight detour in it and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.730
 make a ladder 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.099
 I'll get some wicks right in front of you. 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:14.569
 and I'm going to cut a little more 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:16.280
 everything to make this little girl I am 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.889
 making these layers it is no longer the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.340
 fringe to the side to create new 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.070
 layers then this part that is here 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.810
 this sharing so I go ahead and 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.919
 have to cut a little shorter 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.919
 than the bottom part 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.919
 I then put my fringe on the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.919
 the other side where you do the same thing 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 We're already cut off, I'm going to give a 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.099
 dried up for you to see how it 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.520
 is a dry then again so was 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:01.789
 your little fringe gets a couple of fingers 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.400
 above the eyebrow is more or less 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.490
 straight does not stay such straight Indian type 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.650
 because I do that one scheme of 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.539
 layer and is also cool the system 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.080
 because it gives more volume 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.840
 dimension to the hair is then that 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.750
 all forwards but usually 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.879
 use it on the side so ice cream stays like this 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.860
 It is also super short to stay with 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.870
 who shorter than everything else 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.900
 because I as set aside loses 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.580
 little in length but it's today 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.530
 was easier to use in order to 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.750
 Well, I hope this video has 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.090
 been useful to you for who has the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.250
 short fringe and also runs at home that 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.870
 is to give a differentiated gives a little more 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.960
 of volume do not know 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.330
