doesn't<00:01:04.049> use<00:01:04.170> data<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.670> uses

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
doesn't use data at all it just uses

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.250 
doesn't use data at all it just uses
voice<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:07.140> did<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> couple<00:01:07.619> tests<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> prove<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
voice we did a couple tests to prove it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
voice we did a couple tests to prove it
so<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.740> were<00:01:10.830> trying<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> figure<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:11.970> we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

when I try and call on skype the first

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
thing is that it's reading and the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.460 
thing is that it's reading and the
second<00:02:34.180> thing<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.200> says<00:02:35.440> that

elevator how's it going perfect well I'm

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.110 
elevator how's it going perfect well I'm
glad<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.310> works<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.670> elevator<00:02:49.030> even

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
glad that it works in the elevator even

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.550 
glad that it works in the elevator even
though<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.480> data<00:02:49.630> doesn't<00:02:50.019> work<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:53.260> must<00:02:53.440> be

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
though the data doesn't work it must be

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
though the data doesn't work it must be
because<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:54.010> calling<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.370> phone<00:02:54.580> number

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
because it's calling that phone number

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.789 
because it's calling that phone number
we'll<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.870> back<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> office<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.680> we'll

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
we'll be back in the office and we'll

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.080 
we'll be back in the office and we'll
find<00:02:56.980> another<00:02:57.010> test<00:02:57.430> we'll<00:02:57.670> talk<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.030> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
find another test we'll talk to you in a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.420 
find another test we'll talk to you in a
second<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:02.859> thought<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.280> some

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
second so we thought that was some

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.560 
second so we thought that was some
pretty<00:03:03.519> compelling<00:03:03.940> evidence<00:03:04.120> from<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
pretty compelling evidence from the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.319 
pretty compelling evidence from the
elevator<00:03:04.989> but<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.010> said<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.310> ourselves<00:03:06.430> maybe

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
elevator but we said to ourselves maybe

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.699 
elevator but we said to ourselves maybe
we<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.600> try<00:03:07.750> something<00:03:07.959> that's<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.500> bit

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we can try something that's a little bit

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.890 
we can try something that's a little bit
better<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.820> one<00:03:09.970> thing<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.239> we<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.600> is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
better for one thing that we know is

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.460 
better for one thing that we know is
that<00:03:11.140> verizon<00:03:11.650> network<00:03:11.850> cannot<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:13.120> voice<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that verizon network cannot do voice and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.949 
that verizon network cannot do voice and
data<00:03:14.829> at<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.609> same<00:03:15.790> time<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.540> technical

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
data at the same time it's a technical

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.400 
data at the same time it's a technical
issue<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.319> CDMA

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
issue the CDMA

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.880 
issue the CDMA
so<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:19.400> tend<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.270> try<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.170> talk<00:03:21.650> on

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
so we tend to do is try and talk on

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.910 
so we tend to do is try and talk on
skype<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.580> send<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.390> Skype<00:03:23.780> text<00:03:24.290> message<00:03:24.650> at

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
skype and send a Skype text message at

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.150 
skype and send a Skype text message at
the<00:03:25.220> same<00:03:25.430> time<00:03:25.730> if<00:03:26.690> they<00:03:26.900> can't<00:03:27.200> do<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.650> it's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
the same time if they can't do it it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.550 
the same time if they can't do it it's
because<00:03:28.520> Skype<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.180> talk<00:03:29.210> is<00:03:29.660> using<00:03:29.960> voice<00:03:30.170> and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
because Skype to talk is using voice and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080 
because Skype to talk is using voice and
Danny<00:03:30.920> can't<00:03:31.220> get<00:03:31.370> through

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
Danny can't get through

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.900 
Danny can't get through
so<00:03:33.080> first<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.830> I'll<00:03:33.920> do<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.370> I'll<00:03:34.580> initiate

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
so first what I'll do is I'll initiate

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.510 
so first what I'll do is I'll initiate
the<00:03:35.210> call<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.510> Alex<00:03:35.840> using<00:03:36.350> Skype<00:03:36.680> voice

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.760 

and<00:03:44.850> once<00:03:45.270> again<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.410> calling

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
and once again you can see it's calling

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.900 
and once again you can see it's calling
that<00:03:46.890> phone<00:03:47.100> number<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:50.190> I'm<00:03:50.310> receiving<00:03:50.670> the

so<00:05:07.920> what<00:05:08.040> we<00:05:08.130> think<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.370> happening<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.300> on
