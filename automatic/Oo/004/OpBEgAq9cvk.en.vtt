00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Good afternoon friends, I'm Marian 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.529
 reverse and today we bring you some tips 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.400
 to improve ram memory without being 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.559
 users 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.559
 ruth so let's go straight to the video 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.789
 very good friends, look what 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:28.770
 It is usually a tablet 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.330
 light check how much you have it 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.330
 have at this moment 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.510
 let me enter a second to the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.059
 part d 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.949
 ram we're going to see how it is 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.769
 running the device at this time 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:50.289
 we see 768 committed megagrams and 750 more 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.100
 or less we are talking about 300 megabytes 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.449
 more than usual what things we can 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.460
 do then to be able to decrease 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.410
 ram memory commitment or for 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 to be able to leave ram 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.420
 available and make our 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.200
 device work more fluids look 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 that the more widgets we all have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 these are processes that have to go 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.260
 running and updating and for example 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 this is the case of the youtube widget 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.700
 that is constantly authorizing the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.580
 videos and those are all processes that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 they update and they are running 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.410
 constantly then the first thing that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.270
 we can do is keep the widgets at 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.700
 minimum 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.549
 possible logically some of us are going to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.679
 want to keep but yes yes we can have 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.100
 go eliminating all those that are 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.830
 superfluous or that we do not use the time 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.260
 we are really going to see 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.460
 that we are going to have an optimization 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.460
 in ram memory 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.380
 yes I think we have no more here we have 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.640
 youtube but this is the one that I use 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.590
 usually so we're going to leave it 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.500
 another one of the questions we're going to ask 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.480
 notice that we have a wallpaper 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.319
 animated are also very nice 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.930
 wallpapers but 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.209
 keep a static wallpaper 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.470
 It will also make our 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.770
 device 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.830
 it works a little faster 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.360
 another one of the questions we can ask 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.380
 as they saw we have all the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.220
 recent applications and if android 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.680
 takes care of as far as it goes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.460
 compromising ram with new processes 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.930
 all the older processes are going 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.290
 he starts to stop them from executing 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.640
 always keep the amount of 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.040
 Applications 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.680
 recent kept to the minimum 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 it's also going to be somehow that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.290
 there's more available RAN 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:20.170
 and people like we are already talking about 630 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.990
 megas and so we can go free 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.319
 ram memory another of the issues that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.930
 we can do is not have so much 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.700
 of applications installed in our 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.700
 device 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.340
 but limit the amount of applications 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.019
 that we have installed there really there 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.430
 many applications that we have 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:46.330
 installed but that we use them I do not know a 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.810
 once a week or maybe less one of the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.489
 options is instead of installing 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.620
 directly the application in our 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.620
 device what we can do 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.970
 is to go to the developer's page 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.580
 look for the apk file and keep the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.820
 file on how now let's see 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.360
 I think I have a generated folder 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.360
 that it's called 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.140
 if you apply a second 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.400
 and within this folder picas keep 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.860
 all the applications that we do not use 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.200
 often in this way when 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.540
 we need the application we can 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.360
 install we use it and then the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.130
 uninstall the last of the methods 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 would already be having root access to us 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.320
 We are going to show you a video with a 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.390
 small tutorial about the application 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.700
 green file that will give you some 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.160
 other alternatives to optimize the ram 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.480
 in your device very well I am Mariano 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.550
 of the review of the pse we hope that you 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.260
 have served this video do not forget 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.780
 send us your queries to consultations 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.610
 at review dotcom give a lake if 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.470
 they liked it and subscribe to our channel 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.480

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.480
 attractive we see you the next video
