00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.149
 good in 2002 to a good new video is 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.950
 who recently it up our 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.590
 video but it seems that kotaku has 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.020
 revealed another filtration more about the 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.910
 same poster basically one they had 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.250
 filtering other people this kotaku 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
 otaku as you know is the fucking nemesis 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.570
 of the call of duty have been filtered 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.310
 many times the game very much 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.470
 many characteristics of many of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.470
 the games and others and even forcing 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.720
 on occasion to activision a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.029
 present the game officially or not 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.420
 advance different things that already 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.700
 they had filtered and others with what then 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.820
 this new one seems pretty true to me 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.370
 poster that you are really seeing 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.930
 well the news basically would not have 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.670
 a lot of sense compared to the previous 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
 but basically because something comes out 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.050
 quite interesting 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.550
 it simply mentions that access to 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.010
 the beta will have the people of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.190
 4 xbox band ipc expression by booking 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.890
 the game I do not know if this really 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 would confirm that it does not leave for the whole 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
 generation the game or just 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.700
 would confirm that yes it comes out 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.490
 mention on those platforms no yes no no 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.039
 it would make sense then to mention the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.180
 even though I do not really know 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.610
 it really seems that at least the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.770
 beta does not seem to come out in the previous 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.320
 generation for now game we do not know no 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 we know if it will come out or not, but as 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.009
 I will repeat, this is quite 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.240
 true and it's from gamestop 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.130
 We do not know if here in Spain too 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.710
 some store we will have this incentive 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.649
 of reservation and in addition to us of the next ones 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.240
 hours will end up filtering in the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.160
 date of the beta or what it is that has 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.899
 past this is going to push you to make a 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.899
 revelation or something officially enoteca 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.980
 what you do activision and treyarch but for 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.210
 is now 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.130
 things are like that as I say we will see 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.160
 so more things are filtered for now what 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.440
 I doubt that more things are leaked 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 for today it is possible that yes but I believe 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 that already with this already enough that they 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.950
 have fucked up the release date and 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 what about the surprise of the beta of plus me 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.290
 I already think quite bitch before the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.810
 Sunday and let's hope we do not wait 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.430
 surely that filter is also the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.640
 trailer as it happened with abbas word 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.150
 we finish to see will have to be attentive 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.400
 as I say so good it seems that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.189
 the game could be lost the exit in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.230
 the previous generation or at least in 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.720
 the beta would miss it so good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.650
 nothing more guys this has been everything and nothing 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.650
 more until next time
