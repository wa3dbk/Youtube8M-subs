00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
costumes on the other costume means you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.950 
costumes on the other costume means you
can<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> throwing<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.780> less

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
can do a lot of throwing but it has less

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.760 
can do a lot of throwing but it has less
adrenaline<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.430> less<00:01:05.640> adrenaline

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.719 

dose<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.950> special<00:01:11.280> moves<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
dose some special moves with this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.980 
dose some special moves with this
costume<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> throws<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
costume I think one of the throws is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.179 
costume I think one of the throws is
different<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> maybe<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> adrenaline

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
different and maybe on the adrenaline

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.539 
different and maybe on the adrenaline
moves<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.520> can't<00:01:15.000> find<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.189> they<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.460> at

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
moves but I can't find it they look at

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.380 
moves but I can't find it they look at
that<00:01:17.670> drained<00:01:19.909> also<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> adrenaline

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that drained also the adrenaline

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
that drained also the adrenaline
recharges<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:23.070> slowly<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:25.009> just<00:01:26.009> get

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
recharges very slowly as well just get

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.319 
recharges very slowly as well just get
one<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> these<00:01:26.460> sticks
