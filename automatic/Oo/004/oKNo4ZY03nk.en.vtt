00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 Welcome from the initiative 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.019
 editorial staff 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 I show you here the sony xperia the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.420
 has a 4 inch display with one 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 resolution of 480 x 854 pixels 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 behind it has a 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.519
 here with one with a led front as 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.279
 Also a camera VGA resolution is enough 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.230
 for videochat I would say then have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.420
 We are here to be active like this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.969
 even from the xperia arc still recognizes at that time 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.180
 with ericsson together or also from 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.370
 xperia t that's easy too 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.059
 curved 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 this backside here you can open that 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:01:00.449
 means to remove this cover so one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.989
 sees this silvery no here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 this is not metal that is plastic 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 then we have a slot for the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.619
 sim card and a micro sd card the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.290
 Battery has a capacity of 1750 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:20.159
 millennia so finally want 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.869
 You can say that feels whole 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 I actually because because this is not 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.710
 it is very clear how to do that, for example 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 recognizes the s3 but something to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 used by it is also quite good 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 in the hand and does not slip and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.250
 ago just said this back 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.750
 slot for the sd card maximum 32 gb 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 maybe this will be necessary too 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.860
 because the internal memory is 4 gigabytes 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.079
 large therefore relatively narrow also held 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.579
 clocks the single core processor 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.009
 single-core right only one core with 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.140
 a gigahertz, picking up 512 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.570
 megabytes of RAM back and that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.190
 also makes itself felt that way when you are 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.530
 scrolls back and forth here 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:09.900
 you can already see so easy jerking and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.260
 Overall , the phone takes a little longer 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.500
 to open any things 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:22.800
 or for example, to the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.740
 turn screen so that's it 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.720
 in some other relatively loose from the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.910
 hand 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.730
 However, it is also right 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.580
 cheap you have to say so around the 230 250th 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.790
 euro costs at the moment it runs with 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 android 4.0 point 4 is stream sandwich 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.890
 sony has yet to own 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.960
 User surface is placed over it means 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.950
 the yes that was so gross of sony 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.850
 xperia jay I thank you for watching 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.840
 say goodbye to me from the tents 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.840
 reaction and say so soon
