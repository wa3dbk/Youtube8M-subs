00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:13.170 
amount of food which I don't really do
here<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.590> normally<00:02:03.590> I'd<00:02:03.679> play<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.860> lot<00:02:04.009> safer

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.210

that it does is always an ex-porn which

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.070 
that it does is always an ex-porn which
gives<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.569> lot<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.810> time<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:22.099> dps

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
gives you a lot of time to do you do dps

gives you a lot of time to do you do dps
so<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.620> want<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.860> try<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.190> pass<00:02:26.120> into<00:02:26.540> face<00:02:27.080> to

just<00:02:29.870> an<00:02:29.959> especial<00:02:30.380> as<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.620> done<00:02:30.739> there<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
just an especial as it's done there I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.160 
just an especial as it's done there I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
didn't really time it right because it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.900 
didn't really time it right because it
did<00:02:33.319> like<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.530> few<00:02:33.769> attacks<00:02:34.010> before<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.370> through

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
but if you focus on it properly you can

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
but if you focus on it properly you can
do<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.800> perfectly<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:38.090> enter<00:02:38.300> p2<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.930> want

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
do it perfectly as you enter p2 you want

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.509 
do it perfectly as you enter p2 you want
to<00:02:39.140> use<00:02:39.230> circle<00:02:39.590> soon<00:02:39.769> as<00:02:39.890> possible<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.489> can

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
to use circle soon as possible you can

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.360 
to use circle soon as possible you can
natural<00:02:41.060> instinct<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.140> zerk<00:02:42.349> if<00:02:42.590> you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
natural instinct to get to zerk if you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.830 
natural instinct to get to zerk if you
could<00:02:43.489> time<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.670> right<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.120> that's<00:02:44.510> pretty

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
could time it right but that's pretty

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.910 
could time it right but that's pretty
advanced<00:02:45.440> shit<00:02:47.230> yeah<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.799> did

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
most DPS in between spider spawns I'd

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.059 
most DPS in between spider spawns I'd
recommend<00:04:03.049> using<00:04:03.200> slaughter<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.950> then

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
recommend using slaughter and then

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.250 
recommend using slaughter and then
destroy<00:04:04.459> both<00:04:05.389> of<00:04:05.450> these<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:05.989> stacked

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
destroy both of these if stacked

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.860 
destroy both of these if stacked
properly<00:04:06.859> could<00:04:07.040> hit<00:04:07.280> about<00:04:07.579> 15<00:04:08.060> 20<00:04:08.450> K<00:04:08.540> damage

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
properly could hit about 15 20 K damage

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.490 
properly could hit about 15 20 K damage
per<00:04:09.139> time<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:09.980> use<00:04:10.159> it<00:04:10.340> after<00:04:11.299> you've<00:04:12.109> used<00:04:12.319> it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
per time you use it after you've used it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.750 
per time you use it after you've used it
then<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.769> can<00:04:12.889> concentrate<00:04:13.280> again<00:04:13.669> on

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
then you can concentrate again on

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.330 
then you can concentrate again on
killing<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.180> spiders<00:04:14.569> at<00:04:14.750> spawn<00:04:15.019> and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
killing the spiders at spawn and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.000 
killing the spiders at spawn and
maintaining<00:04:16.340> your<00:04:17.590> health<00:04:18.590> bar

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
maintaining your health bar

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:37.899 
maintaining your health bar
I<00:04:19.039> guess<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:36.590> main<00:04:36.740> focus<00:04:37.130> on<00:04:37.280> phase<00:04:37.460> 3<00:04:37.729> is

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
I guess you main focus on phase 3 is

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.360 
I guess you main focus on phase 3 is
basically<00:04:38.330> killing<00:04:38.960> all<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.229> sport<00:04:39.620> king<00:04:40.250> all

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
basically killing all the sport king all

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.339 
basically killing all the sport king all
the<00:04:40.400> spiders<00:04:40.699> at<00:04:40.970> spawn<00:04:41.210> because<00:04:41.960> they<00:04:42.080> deal<00:04:42.320> a

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
the spiders at spawn because they deal a

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.170 
the spiders at spawn because they deal a
lot<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.650> damage<00:04:42.710> over<00:04:42.949> time<00:04:43.090> dispatching<00:04:44.090> them

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
lot of damage over time dispatching them

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.689 
lot of damage over time dispatching them
should<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.419> your<00:04:44.599> first<00:04:44.780> priority<00:04:45.699> after

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
you've killed all the spiders and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.589 
you've killed all the spiders and
there's<00:04:48.889> no<00:04:49.010> spiders<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.460> spawn<00:04:49.729> then<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.449> can

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
there's no spiders to spawn then you can

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.320 
there's no spiders to spawn then you can
focus<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:51.460> using<00:04:52.460> as<00:04:52.580> much<00:04:52.669> thresholds<00:04:53.210> as
