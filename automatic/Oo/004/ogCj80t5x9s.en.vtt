00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
storytelling yeah even if this would

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.680 
storytelling yeah even if this would
have<00:01:02.699> worked<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.000> lot<00:01:03.120> better<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
have worked a lot better I have a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.359 
have worked a lot better I have a
question<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> ask<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.860> games<00:01:05.040> having<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
question to ask is the games having a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.740 
question to ask is the games having a
screen<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.570> would

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
screen time really something that would

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
screen time really something that would
have<00:01:06.840> mattered<00:01:07.080> well<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:07.950> cut<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.159> like

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
have mattered well but they cut off like

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.859 
have mattered well but they cut off like
to<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.760> definitely<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> external

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to be I definitely have to be external

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.000 
to be I definitely have to be external
as<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:10.470> eternal<00:01:10.830> conflict
