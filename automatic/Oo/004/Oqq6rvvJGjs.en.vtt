i have many people who tell me that i'm

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.920 
i have many people who tell me that i'm
the<00:00:15.389> first<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.070> like<00:00:17.070> people<00:00:17.279> who<00:00:17.880> spend<00:00:18.779> all

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the first one like people who spend all

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.330 
the first one like people who spend all
their<00:00:19.050> time<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.410> youtube<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.130> have

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
their time on youtube because they have

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.470 
their time on youtube because they have
no<00:00:20.550> lives<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.670> flip<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> lever<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
no lives so it you flip the lever and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.710 
no lives so it you flip the lever and
then<00:00:25.550> crafting<00:00:26.550> table<00:00:26.760> pops<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.180> flick<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
then crafting table pops out flick it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.029 
then crafting table pops out flick it
again<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> goes<00:00:28.500> back<00:00:28.529> behind<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
again and then it goes back behind the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.589 
again and then it goes back behind the
wall<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.429> then<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.269> your<00:00:30.300> wall

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
wall and then this would be your wall

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
wall and then this would be your wall
over<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.260> i'll<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.590> your<00:00:31.619> floor<00:00:31.980> wall

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
before previously hear this let me give

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.690 
before previously hear this let me give
you<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> dimensions<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.920> 4

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you the dimensions of this first it's 4

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.799 
you the dimensions of this first it's 4
x<00:00:48.059> 3<00:00:48.420> x<00:00:48.450> 2<00:00:48.660> which<00:00:49.260> equals<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:50.219> 24<00:00:51.030> blocks<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
x 3 x 2 which equals on 24 blocks the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260 
x 3 x 2 which equals on 24 blocks the
previous<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.590> 30<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.280> something<00:00:54.030> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
previous was like 30 or something here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.410 
previous was like 30 or something here
let<00:00:54.420> me<00:00:54.510> go<00:00:55.670> find<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.800> before<00:00:58.820> my<00:00:59.820> friend<00:01:00.149> Nick

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
let me go find it before my friend Nick

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
let me go find it before my friend Nick
Willard<00:01:00.629> stuff<00:01:00.989> held<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> record<00:01:02.070> no<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.460> not

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
Willard stuff held the record no I'm not

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.320 
Willard stuff held the record no I'm not
targeting<00:01:03.059> Nick<00:01:03.329> yeah<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.760> was<00:01:05.760> fixing<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
targeting Nick yeah I just was fixing it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
targeting Nick yeah I just was fixing it
for<00:01:06.360> 1.5<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.770> turned<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.130> made<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
for 1.5 and it turned out I made a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.840 
for 1.5 and it turned out I made a
smaller<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.420> um<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.369> stuck

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
smaller but um here this is that stuck

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
smaller but um here this is that stuck
my<00:01:12.240> design<00:01:12.750> before<00:01:13.500> his<00:01:13.979> design<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.310> like

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
my design before his design was like

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.719 
my design before his design was like
this<00:01:15.090> small<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> his<00:01:16.110> design

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
this small I think this is his design

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.010 
this small I think this is his design
it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.850> 5<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.810> 3<00:01:18.840> by<00:01:19.380> 2<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.700> equals<00:01:20.880> 30<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's a 5 by 3 by 2 and that equals 30 I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's a 5 by 3 by 2 and that equals 30 I
think<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.860> did<00:01:23.070> math<00:01:23.250> correctly<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.939> hope<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
think if I did math correctly I hope I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.789 
think if I did math correctly I hope I
did<00:01:24.750> um<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.619> there's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
did um so that that see how like there's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
did um so that that see how like there's
a<00:01:28.890> block<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> end<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.119> chopped

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
a block on the end over there I chopped

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.539 
a block on the end over there I chopped
it<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.740> goes<00:01:31.829> right<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it off so now it goes right up to the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
it off so now it goes right up to the
piston<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.420> dog<00:01:33.570> pissed<00:01:33.780> extender<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
piston the dog pissed extender and I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
piston the dog pissed extender and I
don't<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.759> anyone<00:01:36.180> could<00:01:36.420> ever<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
don't think anyone could ever make this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.480 
don't think anyone could ever make this
any<00:01:37.350> smaller<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> foreseeable<00:01:38.280> future

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
any smaller in the foreseeable future

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.630 
any smaller in the foreseeable future
because<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.799> only<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> power<00:01:41.400> these

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
because the only way to power these

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
because the only way to power these
pistons<00:01:42.119> individually<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.710> current

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pistons individually with current

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.660 
pistons individually with current
redstone<00:01:44.460> technology<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.100> turn

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
redstone technology and if we don't turn

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
redstone technology and if we don't turn
the<00:01:47.820> micro<00:01:48.119> blocks<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:49.259> future

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the micro blocks in with future

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
the micro blocks in with future
technology<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.570> way<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
technology also then the only way to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
technology also then the only way to
power<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.170> Pistons<00:01:52.649> individually<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
power these Pistons individually and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999 
power these Pistons individually and
time<00:01:53.820> correctly<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.409> layer<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
time correctly is to have a layer on the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.850 
time correctly is to have a layer on the
side<00:01:56.280> um<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.790> uh

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
side um so that's what I have and uh

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.830 
side um so that's what I have and uh
there's<00:02:01.860> no<00:02:02.159> room<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.820> compacting<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> guess

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's no room for compacting I guess

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.639 
there's no room for compacting I guess
you<00:02:03.990> could<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> more

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you could make it more

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
you could make it more
resource-efficient<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.399> something<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> can

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
resource-efficient or something you can

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930 
resource-efficient or something you can
find<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.740> change<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.580> something

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
find a way to change that's something

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.500 
find a way to change that's something
else<00:02:09.030> about<00:02:09.149> whatever<00:02:09.390> um<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.239> go<00:02:12.360> back

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
else about whatever um so if we go back

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
else about whatever um so if we go back
to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.610 
to

one<00:02:16.770> got<00:02:16.920> corrupted<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.410> quite<00:02:19.650> simple

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
one got corrupted now it's quite simple

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.990 
one got corrupted now it's quite simple
i'm<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> show<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.340> how<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.520> build<00:02:20.820> it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
i'm going to show you how to build it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.570 
i'm going to show you how to build it
now<00:02:21.030> you're<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> need<00:02:21.810> two<00:02:22.380> repeaters<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
now you're going to need two repeaters a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600 
now you're going to need two repeaters a
piece<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.570> dust<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:25.380> torches<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.310> sticky

piece of dust two torches and for sticky
pistons<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.420> course<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.690> building

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
pistons and then of course your building

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.500 
pistons and then of course your building
blocks<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> crafting<00:02:28.590> table<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.210> build

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
blocks and crafting table so just build

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.440 
blocks and crafting table so just build
up<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.990> little<00:02:31.800> bit<00:02:31.920> build<00:02:32.460> up<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.760> from<00:02:33.030> the

up a little bit build up to from the
bottom<00:02:33.720> point<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.830> time<00:02:35.280> set<00:02:35.610> day<00:02:35.850> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
bottom point and then time set day you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.850 
bottom point and then time set day you
don't<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.740> that's<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
don't have to do that that's the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.550 
don't have to do that that's the
crafting<00:02:38.220> bench<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:38.880> facedown<00:02:39.840> piston

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
crafting bench and then facedown piston

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.880 
crafting bench and then facedown piston
that's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.490> block<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.830> be

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's a block over there is going to be

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.440 
that's a block over there is going to be
your<00:02:44.520> lover<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.620> find<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.340> is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
your lover if I can find it there it is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.960 
your lover if I can find it there it is
that's<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.780> piece<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.080> dust<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:49.970> that's

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
that's a piece of dust down there that's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.310 
that's a piece of dust down there that's
a<00:02:51.270> repeater<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.530> tix<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.890> delay<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
a repeater on for tix a delay that is a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.810 
a repeater on for tix a delay that is a
torch<00:02:56.660> repeater<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.050> block<00:02:58.820> then

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
torch repeater on to block then

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.130 
torch repeater on to block then
underneath<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.600> want<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> find<00:03:00.960> where

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
underneath here you want to find where

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.700 
underneath here you want to find where
that<00:03:01.550> repeater<00:03:02.550> on<00:03:02.640> four<00:03:03.120> goes<00:03:03.900> into<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
that repeater on four goes into the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.390 
that repeater on four goes into the
block<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> goes<00:03:06.240> right<00:03:06.480> there<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> then

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
block so it goes right there and then

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.940 
block so it goes right there and then
you<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:08.880> place<00:03:09.090> torch<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.530> after

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
you one place torch on that then after

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.590 
you one place torch on that then after
you<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.580> want<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.940> get<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.270> sticky

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
you do that you want to get a sticky

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.750 
you do that you want to get a sticky
piston<00:03:12.920> with<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.190> block<00:03:15.110> then<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.550> here<00:03:17.550> I'll

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
piston with a block then what here I'll

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.520 
piston with a block then what here I'll
explain<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.240> second<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.140> should<00:03:19.410> work

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
explain in a second so it should work

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.610 
explain in a second so it should work
there<00:03:20.400> we<00:03:20.490> go<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.940> fairly<00:03:21.420> quick<00:03:21.690> um<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.440> think

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
there we go it's fairly quick um I think

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.210 
there we go it's fairly quick um I think
so<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.640> also<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:24.140> quick<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.170> compared<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
so it's also really quick to compared to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.200 
so it's also really quick to compared to
other<00:03:26.820> ones<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:28.650> happens<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.340> one

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
other ones but what happens here is one

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.030 
other ones but what happens here is one
its<00:03:30.420> extended<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.080> torch<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:31.650> power<00:03:31.830> this

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
its extended this torch will power this

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.730 
its extended this torch will power this
repeater<00:03:32.520> well<00:03:33.270> this<00:03:33.570> torch<00:03:33.870> over<00:03:33.960> here<00:03:34.230> power

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
repeater well this torch over here power

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.500 
repeater well this torch over here power
is<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:34.980> piston<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.060> power<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.360> this

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
is this piston and also power is this

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.390 
is this piston and also power is this
piston<00:03:36.930> over<00:03:37.110> here<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.920> um<00:03:38.040> when<00:03:38.250> its

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
piston over here but um when its

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.820 
piston over here but um when its
retracted<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:39.360> see<00:03:39.540> how<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.410> torch<00:03:40.710> is

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
retracted you see how like this torch is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.770 
retracted you see how like this torch is
powering<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.400> crafting<00:03:42.120> table<00:03:42.180> right<00:03:42.600> now

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
powering the crafting table right now

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.480 
powering the crafting table right now
which<00:03:43.290> isn't<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.740> anything<00:03:43.920> so

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
which isn't going to do anything so

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.070 
which isn't going to do anything so
until<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:47.450> repeater<00:03:48.450> that's<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.930> word

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
until this repeater that's the word

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.930 
until this repeater that's the word
powers<00:03:49.710> this<00:03:49.860> piston<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.520> piston<00:03:50.820> will

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
powers this piston this piston will

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.170 
powers this piston this piston will
extend<00:03:52.070> push<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.250> piston<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.850> place<00:03:54.030> to

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
extend push this piston in a place to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.940 
extend push this piston in a place to
power<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> torch<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.290> can<00:03:55.410> see<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.590> if

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
power the torch so you can see that if

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.300 
power the torch so you can see that if
you<00:03:56.040> look<00:03:56.190> closely<00:03:56.720> like<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.990> um<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.010> then

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
you look closely like that um and then

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.210 
you look closely like that um and then
down<00:03:59.640> here<00:03:59.700> what's<00:04:00.120> happening<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:01.010> this<00:04:02.010> piece

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
down here what's happening is this piece

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.440 
down here what's happening is this piece
of<00:04:02.370> dust<00:04:02.490> powers<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:03.060> piston

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
of dust powers that piston

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.839 
of dust powers that piston
so<00:04:05.230> right<00:04:05.739> now<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:06.010> powering<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.520> piston

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
so right now it's powering the piston

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.220 
so right now it's powering the piston
and<00:04:06.970> then<00:04:07.090> when<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.569> retracts<00:04:07.870> every<00:04:08.050> tracks

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
and then when it retracts every tracks

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.790 
and then when it retracts every tracks
instantly<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:09.280> one<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:10.080> extends<00:04:11.080> you'll<00:04:11.590> see

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
instantly but one it extends you'll see

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800 
instantly but one it extends you'll see
that<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.280> it'll<00:04:12.819> take<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:13.060> bit<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.300> time<00:04:13.420> to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
that it it'll take a bit of time to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.600 
that it it'll take a bit of time to
extend<00:04:14.230> even<00:04:14.830> though<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.069> receiving<00:04:15.340> power

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
extend even though it's receiving power

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.729 
extend even though it's receiving power
during<00:04:15.940> all<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.359> time<00:04:16.720> like<00:04:17.470> look<00:04:17.680> at

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
during all of that time like look at

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:28.260 
during all of that time like look at
that<00:04:17.919> I'll<00:04:18.760> slow<00:04:19.209> moment<00:04:19.540> for<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.750> now<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:27.669> you

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
that I'll slow moment for you now so you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.420 
that I'll slow moment for you now so you
saw<00:04:28.570> how<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:29.139> took<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.650> bit<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.919> time<00:04:29.979> that<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
saw how it took a bit of time that the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.000 
saw how it took a bit of time that the
reason<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:30.880> because<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.540> piston<00:04:32.050> cannot<00:04:32.650> push

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
reason is because a piston cannot push

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.850 
reason is because a piston cannot push
what<00:04:33.370> we're<00:04:33.639> doing<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.970> piston<00:04:34.419> cannot<00:04:34.690> push<00:04:35.050> an

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
what we're doing a piston cannot push an

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.409 
what we're doing a piston cannot push an
extended<00:04:36.370> piston<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:37.530> while<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:39.520> when<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.000> soon

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
extended piston so while the when I soon

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.930 
extended piston so while the when I soon
as<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.600> flicked<00:04:40.840> that<00:04:40.960> lever<00:04:41.169> down<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.940> this

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
as I flicked that lever down it this

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.629 
as I flicked that lever down it this
should<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.360> able<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.660> activate<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.950> but<00:04:45.280> see

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
should be able to activate and but see

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.400 
should be able to activate and but see
this<00:04:45.760> piston<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.510> extended<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.169> can't

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
this piston is extended and it can't

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.340 
this piston is extended and it can't
push<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.430> it'll<00:04:48.790> stay<00:04:48.820> down<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.660> it

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
push that so it'll stay down and it

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.980 
push that so it'll stay down and it
won't<00:04:50.530> update<00:04:51.360> even<00:04:52.360> when<00:04:52.450> that's<00:04:52.600> retracted

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
won't update even when that's retracted

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.020 
won't update even when that's retracted
it<00:04:53.080> would<00:04:53.350> not<00:04:53.800> normally<00:04:53.950> update<00:04:54.370> like<00:04:54.550> it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
it would not normally update like it

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.820 
it would not normally update like it
would<00:04:55.180> not<00:04:55.300> normally<00:04:55.450> update<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.110> whenever

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
would not normally update so whenever

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.500 
would not normally update so whenever
tracks<00:04:57.040> like<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.520> wouldn't<00:04:57.760> update<00:04:57.850> so

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
tracks like that it wouldn't update so

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.140 
tracks like that it wouldn't update so
what<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:58.840> piston<00:04:59.290> over<00:04:59.500> here<00:04:59.740> does<00:05:00.010> is<00:05:00.280> that

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
what this piston over here does is that

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.770 
what this piston over here does is that
um<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.740> see<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.490> extends<00:05:04.000> with<00:05:04.210> with<00:05:04.540> these

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
um you see it extends with with these

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.280 
um you see it extends with with these
but<00:05:05.350> when<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.560> retract<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:07.300> takes<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.110> bit

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
but when you retract it it takes a bit

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.110 
but when you retract it it takes a bit
of<00:05:08.320> time<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.710> takes<00:05:08.860> as<00:05:09.039> much<00:05:09.190> time<00:05:09.460> as<00:05:09.639> this<00:05:09.760> to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
of time it takes as much time as this to

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.779 
of time it takes as much time as this to
it<00:05:10.360> extent<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.350> mean<00:05:11.560> retracts<00:05:11.919> as<00:05:12.130> soon<00:05:12.700> as

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
it extent I mean retracts as soon as

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:13.890 
it extent I mean retracts as soon as
this<00:05:12.970> one<00:05:13.150> retracts<00:05:13.479> because<00:05:13.690> they're<00:05:13.810> both

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
this one retracts because they're both

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.760 
this one retracts because they're both
getting<00:05:14.050> powered<00:05:14.380> from<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.590> same<00:05:14.740> source

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
getting powered from the same source

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.000 
getting powered from the same source
that<00:05:15.160> torch<00:05:15.400> over<00:05:15.520> there<00:05:15.789> um<00:05:16.350> so<00:05:17.350> as<00:05:17.740> soon<00:05:17.889> as

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
that torch over there um so as soon as

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.290 
that torch over there um so as soon as
that<00:05:18.130> retracts<00:05:18.400> which<00:05:18.729> means<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:19.090> four

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
that retracts which means that this four

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.629 
that retracts which means that this four
tracks<00:05:19.479> which<00:05:19.660> means<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.560> piston<00:05:21.520> can

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
tracks which means that this piston can

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.159 
tracks which means that this piston can
extend<00:05:21.940> because<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.780> means<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:23.050> there

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
extend because that means that there

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.870 
extend because that means that there
would<00:05:23.320> be<00:05:23.350> no<00:05:23.680> more<00:05:23.919> piston<00:05:24.340> above<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:24.700> I

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
would be no more piston above that I

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.370 
would be no more piston above that I
don't<00:05:25.060> know<00:05:25.150> if<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.389> confused<00:05:26.110> your<00:05:26.260> or

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
don't know if I confused your or

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.010 
don't know if I confused your or
something<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.950> probably<00:05:27.370> did<00:05:28.030> I'm<00:05:28.750> not<00:05:28.870> very

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
something I probably did I'm not very

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.110 
something I probably did I'm not very
good<00:05:29.110> at<00:05:29.229> explaining<00:05:29.590> these<00:05:29.830> things<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:30.850> um

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
good at explaining these things but um

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.320 
good at explaining these things but um
it<00:05:31.389> just<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:32.830> time<00:05:32.860> it'll<00:05:33.400> update<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.090> it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
it just in time it'll update it so it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.409 
it just in time it'll update it so it
will<00:05:34.419> extend<00:05:34.720> um<00:05:35.370> like<00:05:36.370> one<00:05:36.700> tick<00:05:36.940> after<00:05:37.270> that

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
will extend um like one tick after that

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.690 
will extend um like one tick after that
retracts<00:05:37.690> which<00:05:38.139> is<00:05:38.440> if<00:05:38.710> it<00:05:39.130> was<00:05:39.220> any<00:05:39.340> faster

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
retracts which is if it was any faster

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.219 
retracts which is if it was any faster
it<00:05:39.789> would<00:05:39.910> push<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.330> block<00:05:40.600> up<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.110> will

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
it would push that block up and it will

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.800 
it would push that block up and it will
see<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.410> crafting<00:05:41.740> table<00:05:41.770> like<00:05:42.100> that<00:05:42.130> um<00:05:42.780> well<00:05:43.780> I

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
see a crafting table like that um well I

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.390 
see a crafting table like that um well I
that's<00:05:44.380> it<00:05:44.560> for<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:44.770> video<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:45.039> just<00:05:45.220> wanted

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
that's it for this video I just wanted

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.700 
that's it for this video I just wanted
to<00:05:45.460> get<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.729> out<00:05:45.910> really<00:05:46.840> quickly<00:05:47.080> that's

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
to get this out really quickly that's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.330 
to get this out really quickly that's
possible<00:05:47.889> uh<00:05:48.539> because<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:49.930> posted<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.919> link<00:05:51.130> in

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
possible uh because I posted a link in

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.190 
possible uh because I posted a link in

the queue hamster builder chat and I'm
not<00:05:53.380> sure<00:05:53.410> if<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:53.800> could<00:05:54.039> trust<00:05:54.340> everyone<00:05:54.760> on

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
not sure if I could trust everyone on
