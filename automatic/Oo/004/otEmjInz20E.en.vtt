 be activists with which is to go 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 go ahead with your support but being 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.550
 present where the facts happen I am 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 Fabiana I'm in my cleaning 18 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.009
 actions and trainer of activists 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.109
 In a few days I will participate in a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.109
 action to save the arctic 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.400
 following the year option 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.410
 past that they made the 30 of the Arctic 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.530
 when they were arrested a month is in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 Russia 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.379
 in that action just the world 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 he found it very difficult to extract oil 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the Arctic without causing an accident 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.070
 Felix his Russian partner Gazprom are the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.960
 oil companies that are extracting oil 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.659
 in this arctic moment the arctic is 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.540
 a very fragile area we know that a 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.890
 oil spill in this place would be 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.990
 irrepressible we have the case of the gulf 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 of mexico is still causing 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 problems 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.240
 this is the first time they achieve 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.620
 extract crude oil in this area and we 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.620
 let's try to stop them 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.409
 that's why it's urgent that atoms now 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.630
 that we go back we have to prevent that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.390
 destroy the attic they tried to shut us up 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 once they tried to strike us many times 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.540
 but we're not going to stop until the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.540
 Arctic is safe 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.770
 I will not be alone when with the support 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.840
 of more than five million people 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.940
 I think they claimed to save the arctic 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 are grounds also enters greenpeace 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.550
 org.ar point and help us stop the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.940
 oil companies so they do not destroy the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.940
 penthouse
