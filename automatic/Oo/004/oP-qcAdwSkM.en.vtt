00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
articulation on the front I mean on the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.100 
articulation on the front I mean on the
head<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:26.460> different<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.990> actually

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
head and it's different I can actually

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
head and it's different I can actually
show<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.590> comparison<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:32.299> there's<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
show you a comparison now there's a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
show you a comparison now there's a
difference<00:01:33.930> between<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.130> tossers<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
difference between the tossers so the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
difference between the tossers so the
both<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.570> similarities<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
both have some similarities and the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
both have some similarities and the
early<00:01:41.430> alien<00:01:42.150> pilots<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.840> have

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
early alien pilots do not have

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.880 
early alien pilots do not have
background<00:01:43.409> by<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> way<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:45.590> which<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> kind

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
background by the way and which is kind

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.319 
background by the way and which is kind
of<00:01:46.979> unfortunate<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> could

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
of unfortunate really because I could

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.340 
of unfortunate really because I could
have<00:01:48.450> seen<00:01:50.990> um<00:01:53.329> quite<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.630> ideas<00:01:54.750> for

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have seen um quite a lot of ideas for

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
have seen um quite a lot of ideas for
the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.120 

design<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> back<00:01:59.040> tosser<00:02:00.680> he<00:02:01.680> also<00:02:01.830> comes

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
design of the back tosser he also comes

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.220 
design of the back tosser he also comes
with<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.370> gun<00:02:02.580> with<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.790> stone<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
with a gun with a stone right as well so

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.530 
with a gun with a stone right as well so
I<00:02:04.710> guess<00:02:05.460> I'll<00:02:05.640> review<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.030> crappy<00:02:06.300> little

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I guess I'll review the crappy little

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.609 
I guess I'll review the crappy little
vehicle<00:02:06.900> that<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:09.000> alien<00:02:09.300> defend<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
vehicle that the alien defend and the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.850 
vehicle that the alien defend and the
alien<00:02:11.250> come<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.020> because<00:02:13.020> with<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> stupid

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
alien come to it because with a stupid

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.370 
alien come to it because with a stupid
one<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.400> when<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.240> think<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.080> from

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
one and when you think that the one from

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.790 
one and when you think that the one from
me<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.890> melon<00:02:17.820> striker<00:02:18.390> can't<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.900> worse<00:02:19.110> well

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
me a melon striker can't get worse well

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.060 
me a melon striker can't get worse well
it<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:19.980> did<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.180> one<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:22.070> nearly

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
it just did because this one is nearly

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.150 
it just did because this one is nearly
impossible<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.880> fly<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.420> gravity<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:28.160> can

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
impossible to fly on gravity and I can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.420 
impossible to fly on gravity and I can
try<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.800> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
try really just what what is it what is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
try really just what what is it what is
