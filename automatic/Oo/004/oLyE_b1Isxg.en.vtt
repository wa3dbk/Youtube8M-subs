00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.590
 hello to all of you it's still me an elegant pinocchio in 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.169
 a new video where I will tell you about the more minecraft islands so 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.109
 the more the more dignified the head 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.759
 so the head is a small detail that can secure chests 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.019
 doors 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.300
 with a sign 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.779
 so you can see it 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.839
 they laid a placard still fresh and clinging 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.159
 the good bah here I am going to find you in the game minecraft 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.819
 so they have me for the second part of the video so 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.819
 eleven girls on my minecraft server 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.630
 my good sir mike golding yacht i will show you how to install in the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.410
 third part of the video 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 so when I come back on my computer 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 at least trend of the moment is how to use it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.320
 so I'm looking for a place 600 points 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 you want to go take 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 in euros the license 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.020
 It is necessary again 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
 you need placards 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 I want the middle one needs a door 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.850
 so if you do not go out anymore 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.729
 e 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.729
 the world if not the best 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.150
 that's it for the door 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
 m opposite 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 before this meeting 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 to that we can not 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.430
 no percent 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 I report at the best time on 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.359
 for houses 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.499
 if the primates one more in the chest we start with the kof 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.789
 you put the sign a sign in front of the chest here 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.779
 you do not approach them yet because the more points 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.859
 on the first line you go markets in square brackets 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.449
 and to ridicule ap 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.149
 the alleged facts 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.479
 on the second line you have marked your name 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.829
 quite a bit 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.909
 they could not 13 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.909
 on the third German line in the second 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.409
 a second person who could open the chest 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.559
 the ips 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.119
 you can go up to 3 people 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.059
 the haye me I'm going alone 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.849
 the sign hangs 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.759
 and a message is displayed 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 so the trunk was pilot 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.609
 so here is otherwise 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.739
 you just have for the body 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.149
 you just have to ask and mark 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:08.439
 primates 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.889
 in parantheses 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.889
 and that mathematically only your taste 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.609
 so here's the law that me who can open the chest 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.609
 I'm going in a row of three little things 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.949
 now for the doors 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.329
 you have several solutions too 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.899
 First 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.899
 so you show yourself on double doors here 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.450
 for the first 6 you put your account above 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.159
 they will score 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.159
 private 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.159
 at the second is another 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.609
 at the third the name of a second person is fourth a third 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.949
 who can open others 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.389
 I want more 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.509
 so the target 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.150
 the prices of a stamp 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.250
 second for his solutions you can do the same but inside 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.309
 marty private 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:29.349
 but your humor 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.190
 the third solution this is not also you have as we can 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.499
 if it's in a recess like that for example 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.029
 and vancouver simply lay it in front of the door the murderer 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.699
 private 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.830
 and here she clings to the door 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.159
 and as often but the door stays open 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.289
 so it's not a problem to spend 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.009
 I think I'm nice 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.009
 at the next match 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.639
 now i want to show for the double doors it's exactly the same 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.639
 except that 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.449
 except that except how to see the these primates 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.180
 it is lined with gold to know if it is a small boat to the new 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.909
 woven excessive speed 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.449
 nowadays a door that meant 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.879
 she was taken 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.199
 so that same thing for the double doors nicosie the partners 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.749
 it seems to me or so to take the breath away 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.699
 if you do not want that m 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.270
 so one day finds on my computer for the third part of the lives of 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.249
 men 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.909
 happy to teach you not installed for ten years marseille 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.909

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:06.770
 so for 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.089
 It's finish 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.020

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:20.520
 the second 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.490
 the study of the title 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.550
