00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 new technique sloth video this time 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.550
 is about red green in no it will be 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.150
 not political it's about the ipads and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.280
 the smart cover i like the smart 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 Cover but actually when I think about it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 40 euros for such a piece of plastic with 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 a magnet in it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 that's where the ones roll again 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 fingernails up but I have to say that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 then use it if I know 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.109
 transport the ipad just so in the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 inside jacket pocket or in backpack or 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 so i have to do the backside myself 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 really no thoughts i'm not a fan 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 from these smart cases but the smart ones 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.210
 I especially like cover when I'm like this 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 can open up a bit and then 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 fix something or type something 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 on the screen that goes in for me 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.370
 order and for the transport I like it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 Just like that and I am since I believe 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 ipad2 times there was the first time 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.050
 iPad in white a fan of the red smart 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 cover in combination with white has 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 nothing with dÃ¼sseldorf or fortuna too 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.780
 do or fries or whatever 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 but I think the combination is beautiful 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 Now I have someone who necessarily 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.110
 want to have green and black and if 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 one keeps it that way next to each other 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.439
 must say the green I'm watching 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 again on the camera display comes to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.979
 some bright and hefty away old 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.810
 in reality that's something 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 well, let me tell you something stronger 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790
 I would have preferred green , especially here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 so that green from the inlay I find that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 Great, that's a nice green-red 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.159
 it does not really differ that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.100
 is a bit darker though 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 not as blatant as this at the im 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 green on the outside you can see here in the middle 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 still and the inside is green but of 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.460
 the combination yes yes yes yes yes me 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 could now go for a short time 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.939
 and once swap at gives definitely 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.100
 many of these I think so too 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.700
 but sometimes green with white 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 well green white and red with black and red 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.009
 with black I can already 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.770
 again, imagine that you 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.450
 but then again, but nice 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.060
 white with this green 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.840
 I do not know , it's natural, of course 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.530
 always a matter of taste 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.319
 but with the green I'm out earlier 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.459
 There were still some of those at the 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.170
 great 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.080
 that's how apple changes every year 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 Material and color used to be there too 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.940
 even the things in worbis down here in 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.129
 light gray of course that has something 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.140
 already a lot with him then 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.030
 already the dark spots and gray was 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.160
 such a thing that was so the emergency 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.840
 compromise that went on white also quite 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.940
 good and then black again 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160
 not good at all in my eyes 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.160
 what colors does apple still have today? 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.290
 again offers a complete black 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.569
 Unfortunately I have nothing here then what synonymous 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.769
 only partially black is black on 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.599
 black I would say yes 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.209
 black and white there you have it again 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.000
 Maybe a panda would not be like that 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.860
 mine and then there are blue with 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.810
 this is the blue of the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.599
 nexus s from the nexus packaging of 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.220
 eric from the case so elaborately great that is 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.019
 strong that it is dark but that is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.420
 not the blue apple that gives you 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.420
 Apple gives you more behind such a 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.760
 bright washed blue thing i do 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.739
 that changes a bit to that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.829
 green what I think not strong enough 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.870
 which is blue here in the video 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.859
 again too nice over again 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.870
 it still comes, I'll say it 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.060
 baby bright blue in front 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.180
 also not really mean and then 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.359
 remains as the last color variant note 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.910
 in the current season still money sorry 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.540
 yellow and yellow again 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.569
 same as green and light blue 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.349
 that's easy to say I'm not 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.540
 strong enough my eyes I think 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.190
 not really so not not like that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.880
 plump stays in my eyes actually 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.500
 only red or just black but red 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.959
 for both and black then only for 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.739
 black but now everyone just like it 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.450
 would like 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.400
 I 'm just doing that here 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.880
 short-circuit so briefly the comparison 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.560
 kept low because few but 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.599
 but come here and my standard 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.790
 tips and trick the green comes here 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.320
 I definitely want to get away in the video too well 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.130
 at this point say so in the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.130
 Reality does not matter 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.970
 Apple always says you fold it 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.980
 the inside out then it is 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.630
 stable ok I give them you can 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.540
 press on it more and with more pressure 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.390
 hammer on me but disadvantage her 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.640
 have this soft inlay out again 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.850
 in the dirt on tables where he is 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.860
 always on exciting and collects with it 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.660
 the dirt and everything is not like that 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.910
 really mine is my variant then 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.680
 always not that stable 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.290
 the exterior continues to be outside 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.520
 fold and then you can also type 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.560
 you just have to do it a bit 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.320
 you just have to take care a bit 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.520
 you do not stay anymore you probably get out of it 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.620
 Just be careful that you can not 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.180
 very much on top of that presses 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.370
 then it gets worse and then 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.420
 the bmz pops to public but is 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.640
 not so high now 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.260
 but then do not be surprised but I have 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.940
 used to it investigation find 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.670
 I then better than the soft 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.020
 page outside how are the things from that 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.570
 is new there is still no 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.500
 Scratch on it and the thing goes now 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.840
 already in the second season has a lot 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.550
 join in just when the red color 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.860
 so the outer edges so slow 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.030
 black that goes down here too 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.500
 maybe I should clean it 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.420
 but I think I get the dirt 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.820
 not out but it still looks in 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.620
 my eyes are relatively neat 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
 That is what it was supposed to be a lot of 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.200
 Thanks for watching makes it good and up 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.200
 to the next video
