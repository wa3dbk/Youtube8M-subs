extremely helpful with with with my job

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.959 
extremely helpful with with with my job
well<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.889> actually<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.280> radiation

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
well that's actually a radiation

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.370 
well that's actually a radiation
treatment<00:01:36.450> machine<00:01:36.569> it's<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.289> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
treatment machine it's actually the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
treatment machine it's actually the
first<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.950> Australia<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.609> we've<00:01:38.759> we've

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
first in Australia that we've we've

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
first in Australia that we've we've
we've<00:01:40.079> acquired<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.859> so<00:01:41.100> basically<00:01:41.939> what

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we've acquired and so basically what

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.539 
we've acquired and so basically what
happens<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> electrons<00:01:43.499> get<00:01:43.950> produced<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.459> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
happens is electrons get produced from a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
happens is electrons get produced from a
filament<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.270> accelerated<00:01:45.749> along

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
filament and they get accelerated along

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.160 
filament and they get accelerated along
a<00:01:46.109> waveguide<00:01:46.729> acceleration<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.659> electrons

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a waveguide acceleration of electrons

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.480 
a waveguide acceleration of electrons
when<00:01:49.319> they<00:01:49.409> hit<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> target<00:01:49.889> produces

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
when they hit a target produces

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.309 
when they hit a target produces
radiation<00:01:50.639> which<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.479> photons<00:01:52.139> of

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
radiation which is photons of

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.260 
radiation which is photons of
high-energy<00:01:52.649> depending<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.789> energy<00:01:54.179> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
high-energy depending on the energy of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.129 
high-energy depending on the energy of
the<00:01:54.359> electron<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.749> accelerate<00:01:55.289> then<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
the electron they accelerate then it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.050 
the electron they accelerate then it
then<00:01:58.139> is<00:01:58.380> used<00:01:58.889> to<00:01:59.130> sort<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.459> treat<00:01:59.700> cancer
