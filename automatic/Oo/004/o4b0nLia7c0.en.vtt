00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.320 
but I think the biggest things always
challenged<00:03:40.830> us<00:03:40.950> he<00:03:41.430> always<00:03:41.580> tried<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.879> push<00:03:42.150> us

to<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> higher<00:03:42.690> level<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.040> he's<00:03:44.310> done<00:03:44.549> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
to a higher level and now he's done that
