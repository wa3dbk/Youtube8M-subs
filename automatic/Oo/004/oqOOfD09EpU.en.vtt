 known but here is the company stm childhood 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.230
 for me you know how bush lane is that 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.059
 the same forshmak meat on wheels itself 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.760
 represents a kind of racing arcade 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.329
 which we have to push with stupidity 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.830
 masturbate and earn more jackets dolby 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:11.090
 in the opponent's output pipe breathe him 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.200
 back tearing his bones in general tearing it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.240
 everything looks pretty pretty 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.040
 now the early version is only available 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 a couple of modes, the developers have promised that 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.000
 gradually and updates will be all 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.380
 add more wheelbarrows big coke 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.290
 more whores in general 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.930
 and level but we can’t prank me 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.909
 I understand what all the developers have come from 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.729
 else 7 quality release in early access 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.119
 that raw product is all raw 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.829
 a lot through the graphics on the bird room damn 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.020
 you can not even evaluate the game on the schedule 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.579
 cheskaya only gameplay there is not all 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.369
 maps all movements included a lot of things 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:55.549
 somehow sad india how to give 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.299
 for such a game right now I just don’t 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.479
 I can understand it beyond my 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.170
 cosmic clever brain but fetus i am not 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.689
 I will all curse will not swear 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.599
 a little and generally without grandfather I write such 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.660
 let's move on more gameplay 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.239
 what do i say in the gameplay will 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.270
 spend all that to see from the cow to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 machines of the world in principle that is in principle 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.780
 physics works pretty well 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.989
 and everything will be fine but unfortunately 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.840
 the amount of eating will be a cartoon will 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.720
 career will be free 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.580
 race that is of course solitary think 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.880
 there will be an emphasis on cartoons because in 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.760
 principle there karno start very good 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.299
 I will even say very seriously very well 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.620
 see looks like destruction of course there is 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.019
 their tapes are not completely 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.549
 fine, but for now, we won't have them 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 disassemble it will be extra 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.970
 Achivki open cars pass the road 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.569
 career we drive on the cartoon develop in 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.420
 Generally quite whole thing fun 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.970
 looks very well let's see what will happen 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.150
 In the future, I know of course I could now 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.970
 would breed the great and mighty feed 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:19.510
 gi dong from 97 to 2014 about 1 in total 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.880
 series to which went on a toast in '97 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.390
 I remember it all was tin 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.480
 I played of course vidos more convenient golyak was 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.519
 there years but not the point i remember i 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 played and some year often not 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.420
 I remember how these cows were on the sides 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.150
 how I drove my car and they spat 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.930
 they have green blood had been some general 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.049
 these cows this kind of life is just 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.910
 imagine it was impossible it was somehow 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.609
 the spirit just then can tell you about 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.299
 carmageddon 2 which came out ninety 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:04:00.720
 the eighth year also gets it first 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:03.690
 was on windows with blazing engine and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.790
 render for me this series is especially especially 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.730
 I do not remember for me of course for 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.880
 belt and more so arbidon this is rd 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.400
 Thousands of the year it was generally something 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 something too on until it came out just 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.750
 really blew the brain too cartoon there 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.090
 It was the same but I do not want much about it 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.080
 let me have more stories now 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.320
 I will talk about the general engine in general about 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.150
 this is our pocket house but i'm not a fan 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.520
 stretch stories telling 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.840
 the prehistory series because i do 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.240
 pure review on this game 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.180
 let's dive into my grafon 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 favorite well then the game on the engine was 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.570
 debug is not at all here for me engine 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.350
 which is linked by steel marx with 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.860
 Photoshop, that is, it works very well 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.590
 on pc platforms basically like 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.320
 stainless games says that 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.169
 they specifically made this engine for 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.500
 yet platforms but i think for all 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.919
 platforms principle what they justify 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.590
 but they write that it is quite different 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.560
 look on different platforms and depends 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.900
 This ployka or boxing let quite different 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.970
 graphics that most you rush into 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.310
 eyes i certainly think it is machines 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.419
 which is most likely the most 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:31.380
 paid attention to make 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.570
 spectacular destruction so just 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.400
 focus all on machines 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.890
 the world is in the game quite the moment 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.520
 remember purely tell your opinion that he 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.090
 badly traced the simple polina fences 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.280
 definitions I can not say at all 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.030
 textured such 2d general horror just 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.130
 terribly traced with bleuer not much 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.490
 go too far in principle the picture is good 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.180
 gamma also looks all still four 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.770
 maps I can rate on the chart in general 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.560
 most do not like this long 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:12.150
 such a small city turns out 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.599
 these tracks take the small bridge to 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.030
 overall looks pretty good but 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.979
 the car is destroyed first thing i 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.500
 which is pretty good but then 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.560
 peered of course there are advanced games 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.900
 which I shcha collapses brighter everything 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.680
 Looks like a car in the trash. 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.210
 break up 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:38.880
 to the smallest detail there it is all 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:43.289
 looks pretty nice if 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.560
 rate this game up to 10 i.e. 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:49.490
 from 1 to 10 at the moment you can 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.990
 hard Pyaterochka put after all 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.680
 looks good but everything but the car 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.550
 highlights 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.039
 the world is drawn pretty and as i say 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.220
 bad i don't want to just shower my hats 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.380
 to catch 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.590
 she 's not going to swear 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.620
 all if you are interested, go all 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:13.250
 get early access with you from virgins 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.250
 see you all bye bye wagon
