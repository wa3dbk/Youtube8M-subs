this thing out so I think I can do this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580 
this thing out so I think I can do this
we're<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.100> hit<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> Oh<00:01:54.320> cleared<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
we're gonna hit that Oh cleared it by a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
we're gonna hit that Oh cleared it by a
lot<00:01:56.070> Wow

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
lot Wow

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
lot Wow
the<00:01:57.570> physics<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> thing<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the physics on this thing are a lot of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
the physics on this thing are a lot of
fun<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.820> feels<00:01:59.850> pretty<00:02:00.270> realistic<00:02:00.990> um<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.829> think

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
fun it feels pretty realistic um I think

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
fun it feels pretty realistic um I think
the<00:02:02.460> suspension<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.329> been<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the suspension could have been a little

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
the suspension could have been a little
spongy<00:02:04.350> ER<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.560> feel<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> suspension<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spongy ER I feel like the suspension is

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.789 
spongy ER I feel like the suspension is
a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.060> stiff<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.899> monster<00:02:07.259> truck<00:02:07.500> ooh

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a little stiff for a monster truck ooh

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.820 
a little stiff for a monster truck ooh
that<00:02:08.729> could<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> been<00:02:09.000> bad<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:10.050> overall<00:02:10.379> you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that could have been bad but overall you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550 
that could have been bad but overall you
know<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.489> love<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.660> okay<00:02:13.020> no<00:02:13.200> vehicle

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know I love it this one okay no vehicle

the monsters well you know maybe we'll

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.619 
the monsters well you know maybe we'll
let's<00:02:16.709> find<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.150> we're<00:02:18.150> gonna<00:02:18.209> hit<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.510> right

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
let's find out we're gonna hit it right

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.640 
let's find out we're gonna hit it right
about<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.760> oh<00:02:21.260> alright<00:02:22.260> we'll<00:02:22.440> try<00:02:22.620> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
about there up oh alright we'll try it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.540 
about there up oh alright we'll try it
one<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.040> time

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
one more time

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.220 
one more time
I<00:02:23.849> always<00:02:24.180> try<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.629> up<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.959> with<00:02:25.080> like

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
I always try going up that with like

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.100 
I always try going up that with like
every<00:02:25.530> vehicle<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.110> none

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
every vehicle I do this with and none

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.259 
every vehicle I do this with and none
ever<00:02:28.410> make<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> part<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.879> let's<00:02:29.910> try

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
ever make it up that part so let's try

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.930 
ever make it up that part so let's try
it<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.720> more<00:02:30.750> time<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.620> gotta<00:02:32.519> hit<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.819> with

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
it one more time just gotta hit it with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.750 
it one more time just gotta hit it with
the<00:02:33.030> right<00:02:33.060> amount<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.450> speed<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.110> nope<00:02:35.069> I'm

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the right amount of speed and nope I'm

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.339 
the right amount of speed and nope I'm
trying<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.239> tire<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> left<00:02:37.140> side

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
trying to get my tire on the left side

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.530 
trying to get my tire on the left side
of<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> maybe<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.269> kind<00:02:39.510> of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
of it there so that maybe it kind of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.800 
of it there so that maybe it kind of
goes<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:39.900> easier<00:02:40.430> um<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.519> plan<00:02:42.120> I'll<00:02:42.239> try<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.690> if

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
goes up easier um I plan I'll try and if

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.850 
goes up easier um I plan I'll try and if
this<00:02:42.930> doesn't<00:02:43.110> work<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:43.349> we're<00:02:43.560> gonna<00:02:43.680> keep

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this doesn't work then we're gonna keep

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.400 
this doesn't work then we're gonna keep
going<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.849> ways<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:46.080> its

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
going the ways you know that's its

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.490 
going the ways you know that's its
intended<00:02:47.090> mmm<00:02:49.489> no<00:02:50.489> no<00:02:51.150> okay<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:52.019> not<00:02:52.230> today

the mountain okay

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.449 
the mountain okay
alright<00:02:57.780> we're<00:02:57.959> gonna<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> normal<00:02:59.310> way

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
alright we're gonna take the normal way

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
notice that in the video - there it is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.729 
notice that in the video - there it is
cheese<00:03:05.580> again<00:03:06.060> uh<00:03:06.750> Wow

cheese again uh Wow
the<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.069> line<00:03:08.340> must<00:03:08.550> be<00:03:08.670> having<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.970> few<00:03:09.180> issues

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
the on line must be having a few issues

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.589 
the on line must be having a few issues
or<00:03:09.629> something<00:03:10.580> why<00:03:11.580> why<00:03:12.120> does<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.420> keep

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
or something why why does they keep

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.300 
or something why why does they keep
doing<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.319> just<00:03:13.349> keeps<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.769> freezing

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
doing that it just keeps like freezing

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.089 
doing that it just keeps like freezing
for<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.659> tiny<00:03:15.659> part<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.140> second<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.980> this

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
to do this before but if you see your

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.050 
to do this before but if you see your
video<00:03:28.769> skipping<00:03:29.129> like<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.730> not<00:03:29.909> your

computer you know I wonder if those
gonna<00:03:32.040> freeze<00:03:32.280> all<00:03:32.519> together<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:33.120> it

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
gonna freeze all together because it

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.820 
gonna freeze all together because it
seems<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.659> getting<00:03:33.750> worse<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.560> a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
seems like it's getting worse that's a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.500 
seems like it's getting worse that's a
little<00:03:35.069> weird<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.970> we're<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.150> gonna<00:03:36.360> keep

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
little weird but we're just gonna keep

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.100 
little weird but we're just gonna keep
going<00:03:36.659> anyway

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
going anyway

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.559 
going anyway
yeah<00:03:37.950> these<00:03:38.069> freezes<00:03:38.580> definitely<00:03:39.209> seem<00:03:39.420> like

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
yeah these freezes definitely seem like

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.630 
yeah these freezes definitely seem like
they're<00:03:39.720> getting<00:03:39.840> longer<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.340> strange

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
they're getting longer this is strange

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.930 
they're getting longer this is strange
but<00:03:42.000> we're<00:03:42.569> gonna<00:03:42.690> keep<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:42.900> nonetheless

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940

because of the freezing this is so

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.760 
because of the freezing this is so
strange<00:04:02.030> why<00:04:03.030> maybe<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.900> don't<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:04.740> I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
that would do probably absolutely

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.350

this<00:05:56.070> good<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.580> merely<00:05:56.970> goes<00:05:57.270> up<00:05:57.510> some<00:05:57.810> almost

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
this good it merely goes up some almost

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.180 
this good it merely goes up some almost
vertical<00:05:59.280> walls<00:05:59.550> so<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:01.560> one<00:06:01.710> thing<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:02.010> in

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
vertical walls so the one thing is in

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.220 
vertical walls so the one thing is in
the<00:06:02.280> air<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.669> gets<00:06:02.880> really<00:06:03.180> crazy<00:06:03.510> I<00:06:03.930> mean<00:06:04.110> you

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
the air it gets really crazy I mean you

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.779 
the air it gets really crazy I mean you
can<00:06:04.350> see<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.500> sometimes<00:06:04.860> off<00:06:05.190> jumps<00:06:05.610> it's

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
can see that sometimes off jumps it's

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.330 
can see that sometimes off jumps it's
just<00:06:05.940> completely

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
just completely

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.790
