00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.490
 perfect super exciting what he can do here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.490
 it's about traveling right away 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.200
 super fast going on here in the category 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 earman rocker at the start and had 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.340
 a point distribution is 60 to 70 often 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.340
 certainly a justification 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 in skill we reach here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.080
 highest score at the expert and at the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.890
 professional of the cologne has also 455th 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.890
 score with it 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.610
 the category style is here 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.950
 the core of carving was just great 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.990
 handy and very good to buy is very 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.850
 racing on the edge , though 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.750
 455 points also have one 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 very good choice 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.250
 again my hero meets rallys i have 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.960
 Everything here can be quite clear 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.000
 the new scanner shows you very well 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.400
 on the pista is very aggressive grad 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.590
 middle second radii really loads there 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.720
 one to buy and has this sporty one 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.820
 Note of the power is really fun with 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.960
 train to drive but can also 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.450
 just by the loose they manage 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.250
 facilitate easy swinging 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.990
 the other side is just this is often 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 so in the locked terrain as for 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.010
 An example of which one always knows us 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 can still guess 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.490
 he works very simple and very 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.990
 so easily through this shovel runs 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.540
 that's great but these hump this 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.910
 feel me terrain types and by 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.680
 So if you have one 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.640
 shepherd wants everything then is the hero with 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.460
 safety a very hot candidate 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.070
 no specialist gets that clear 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.980
 There are several but also more 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.760
 peace but less ultimately 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.280
 both in one 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 so can hold so much fun again 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.490
 so that you can really rock it 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.490
 let's go
