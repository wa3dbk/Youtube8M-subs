do so we're very very happy with and
with<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.149> 50%<00:01:37.780> reduction<00:01:38.319> of<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:38.860> nitrogen

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
with the 50% reduction of your nitrogen

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.240 
with the 50% reduction of your nitrogen
inputs<00:01:39.789> have<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.869> noticed<00:01:41.200> any<00:01:41.530> decline<00:01:42.009> in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
inputs have you noticed any decline in

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.760 
inputs have you noticed any decline in
the<00:01:42.369> color<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.789> field<00:01:43.200> no<00:01:44.200> not<00:01:44.409> at<00:01:44.500> all<00:01:44.590> two

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the color of the field no not at all two

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.960 
the color of the field no not at all two
minutes<00:01:44.920> continue<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.759> stay<00:01:45.940> green<00:01:47.670> no<00:01:48.670> issues

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
minutes continue to stay green no issues

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.690 
minutes continue to stay green no issues
at<00:01:49.000> all<00:01:49.380> well<00:01:50.380> when<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.979> look<00:01:51.190> at<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.399> field

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
at all well when you look at the field

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.699 
at all well when you look at the field
we<00:01:52.030> talked<00:01:52.270> earlier<00:01:52.660> about<00:01:52.750> how<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.259> had

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
we talked earlier about how you had

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.279 
we talked earlier about how you had
improved<00:01:54.250> roots<00:01:54.729> but<00:01:55.599> I<00:01:55.660> think<00:01:55.989> you<00:01:56.110> also

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
improved roots but I think you also

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.260 
improved roots but I think you also
alluded<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.069> fact<00:01:57.099> that<00:01:57.459> you<00:01:57.849> thought

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
alluded to the fact that you thought

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.449 
alluded to the fact that you thought
there<00:01:58.599> was<00:01:58.780> more<00:01:58.989> density<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.770> turf<00:02:00.009> yes

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
there was more density in the turf yes

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.930 
there was more density in the turf yes
yes<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:02.590> something<00:02:02.830> you<00:02:03.039> can<00:02:03.069> measure<00:02:03.429> or

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
yes is it something you can measure or

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.330 
yes is it something you can measure or
is<00:02:04.569> it<00:02:04.750> something<00:02:04.959> you<00:02:05.259> feel<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.679> think<00:02:06.129> that<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
is it something you feel I think that to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.589 
is it something you feel I think that to
finish<00:02:06.610> something<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.179> throughout<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
finish something you go throughout the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.869 
finish something you go throughout the
year<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:07.840> looking<00:02:08.140> at<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.379> knowing<00:02:08.769> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
year just looking at it knowing that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.699 
year just looking at it knowing that
previous<00:02:09.879> years<00:02:10.060> I've<00:02:10.300> been<00:02:10.509> here<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.590> you

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
previous years I've been here and you

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.410 
previous years I've been here and you
notice<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.099> difference

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.450 

so<00:02:16.420> you've<00:02:17.020> been<00:02:17.050> using<00:02:17.230> organics<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:18.250> about

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
so you've been using organics for about

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.930 
so you've been using organics for about
a<00:02:18.490> year<00:02:18.730> now

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
a year now

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
a year now
yes<00:02:19.690> how<00:02:20.590> has<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.890> affected<00:02:21.130> your<00:02:21.550> budget<00:02:21.970> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
yes how has it affected your budget I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.530 
yes how has it affected your budget I
think<00:02:23.770> looking<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.970> numbers<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.360> some<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
think looking at the numbers of some I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.690 
think looking at the numbers of some I
think<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:25.960> very<00:02:26.200> inexpensive<00:02:26.590> for<00:02:27.550> what

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
think it's very inexpensive for what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.680 
think it's very inexpensive for what
we're<00:02:27.850> getting<00:02:27.970> out<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:31.600> been

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
we're getting out of it and it's been

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.380 
we're getting out of it and it's been
great<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.230> hasn't<00:02:32.350> affected<00:02:32.590> me<00:02:32.950> too<00:02:33.100> much

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
great that hasn't affected me too much

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.300 
great that hasn't affected me too much
grease<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.990> floor<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.010> notice<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
grease on that floor you can notice a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.170 
grease on that floor you can notice a
lot<00:02:36.520> more<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.300> root<00:02:37.480> growth

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
lot more of the root growth

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.539 
lot more of the root growth
get<00:02:38.629> our<00:02:38.750> new<00:02:38.900> side<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.260> we're<00:02:39.409> puttin<00:02:39.769> and

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
get our new side that we're puttin and

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.000 
get our new side that we're puttin and
it<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:41.450> helped<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.840> blend<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.860> it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it just helped it blend in and it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.710 
it just helped it blend in and it
admitted<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.549> lot<00:02:43.700> bathroom<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.420> that's<00:02:44.569> what

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
admitted a lot bathroom and that's what

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.500 
admitted a lot bathroom and that's what
I<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:45.170> supposed<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.590> present<00:02:46.180> hold<00:02:47.180> annex

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
I was supposed to be present hold annex

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.929 
I was supposed to be present hold annex
is<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:47.659> process<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.439> reintroducing<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
is a process about reintroducing the

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.699 
is a process about reintroducing the
biology<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.569> already<00:02:51.019> exists<00:02:51.530> here

biology that already exists here

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.309 
biology that already exists here
indigenous<00:02:52.239> organisms<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.390> already<00:02:54.019> live

indigenous organisms that already live

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.399 
indigenous organisms that already live
and<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.890> work<00:02:55.069> for<00:02:55.519> us<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.810> objective

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
and do the work for us the objective

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.039 
and do the work for us the objective
here<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:58.430> raise<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.150> level<00:02:59.510> again<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
here is to raise that level again to the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.690 
here is to raise that level again to the
point<00:03:00.319> where<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> natives<00:03:01.040> understand<00:03:01.549> what

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
point where the natives understand what

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.699 
point where the natives understand what
they're<00:03:01.849> doing<00:03:02.150> because<00:03:02.750> we're<00:03:03.140> bringing<00:03:03.590> in
