 a playstation tonight 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 and expected and peered at Playstation 4 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.890
 but because such 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.930
 I figured out because 6 o'clock in the evening 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 in new york we are 12 o'clock 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 now bulls in the wall or at night 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 get flow out of my head so then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.679
 we have to wait but how people 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 are hungry 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.460
 by including so we drink yourself 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.590
 wheels and food and pizza 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.039

 just looking becomes beats from the west 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.019
 Then you have his opinion she should be there 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.019
 These time-lapse create 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.540
 how you could see how with the module 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.790

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.440

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.700

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.850

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.580
 in no extension so he can do it 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.690

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.490

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.350
 This is declaring all work in progress 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 time 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:59.470

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.209
