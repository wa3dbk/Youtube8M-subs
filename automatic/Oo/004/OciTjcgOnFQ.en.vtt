one of the most frustrating things about

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.679 
one of the most frustrating things about
baitcasting<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.700> trying<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> cast<00:00:03.300> into<00:00:03.629> the

wind you know I don't like to do it

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.829 
wind you know I don't like to do it
unless<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.460> just<00:00:05.490> have<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.120> like<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.540> use<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
unless I just have to I like to use the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.080 
unless I just have to I like to use the
wind<00:00:07.109> winds<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.830> friend<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.639> use<00:00:08.849> that

wind winds my friend I like to use that
wind<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.420> my<00:00:09.599> advantage<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.260> I'll<00:00:10.590> get

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
wind to my advantage so I'll get

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
wind to my advantage so I'll get
downwind<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.340> left<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.030> cast<00:00:12.269> downwind<00:00:12.750> but

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
downwind and left and cast downwind but

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.709 
downwind and left and cast downwind but
sometimes<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:13.769> you're<00:00:13.950> especially<00:00:14.719> shooting

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
sometimes if you're especially shooting

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.730 
sometimes if you're especially shooting
at<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.080> target

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
at one target

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
at one target
you've<00:00:17.039> got<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> cast<00:00:17.609> into<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.180> wind<00:00:18.449> it's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
you've got to cast into that wind it's

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
you've got to cast into that wind it's
really<00:00:18.960> hard<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.189> no

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
really hard to do and there's really no

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400 
really hard to do and there's really no
way<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> adjust<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.420> bait<00:00:21.600> casting<00:00:22.020> reel<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
way to adjust a bait casting reel to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960 
way to adjust a bait casting reel to
where<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> cast<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> wind<00:00:23.580> without

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
where you can cast in the wind without

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
where you can cast in the wind without
thumb<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> spool<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> learn

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
thumb in the spool so you have to learn

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.589 
thumb in the spool so you have to learn
to<00:00:26.130> thumb<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> spool<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.119> takes<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.420> little

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
to thumb the spool it takes a little

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
to thumb the spool it takes a little
practice<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.680> you'll<00:00:28.830> practice<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
practice but if you'll practice with it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
practice but if you'll practice with it
you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> cast<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you can do it let's make a cast here and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
you can do it let's make a cast here and
you'll<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.399> thumb<00:00:32.640> down

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you'll see that I've got that thumb down

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.700 
you'll see that I've got that thumb down
on<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.239> spool<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> cast<00:00:34.469> like

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
on that spool I'm going to cast like

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.150 
on that spool I'm going to cast like
this<00:00:35.780> there<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> threw<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> stiff<00:00:37.920> wind

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this there see I threw in a stiff wind

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
this there see I threw in a stiff wind
without<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> backlash<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.450> key<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> you're

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
without a backlash the key is you're

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
without a backlash the key is you're
come<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> another<00:00:40.829> braking<00:00:41.309> system<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> just

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
come is another braking system you just

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
come is another braking system you just
need<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> slow<00:00:42.600> down<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.960> rotation<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
need to slow down the rotation of that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
need to slow down the rotation of that
spool<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> thumb

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
spool and you can do it with that thumb

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
spool and you can do it with that thumb
just<00:00:46.289> practice<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.149> backlash

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
just practice you see a little backlash

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
just practice you see a little backlash
over<00:00:48.960> run<00:00:49.320> coming<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.579> thumb

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
over run coming like that get that thumb

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.549 
over run coming like that get that thumb
down<00:00:51.059> hard<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> spool<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.140> stop<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
down hard on that spool and stop it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.959 
down hard on that spool and stop it
because<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.010> better<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> stop<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
because it's better to stop it with a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
because it's better to stop it with a
little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> real<00:00:55.050> bad<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
little bit then have a real bad one that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
little bit then have a real bad one that
you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> sit<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> pick<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.120> cut

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you have to sit down and pick out or cut

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.189 
you have to sit down and pick out or cut
out<00:00:58.550> there<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> last<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.390> its<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
key is have some patience pick it out

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
key is have some patience pick it out
slowly<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.170> he'll<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:07.350> took

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
me a long time to learn to cast into the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
me a long time to learn to cast into the
wind<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> baitcaster<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.710> takes

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
wind with a baitcaster it just takes

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
wind with a baitcaster it just takes
practice<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.580> patience<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.450> you're<00:01:12.630> willing

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to spend a little extra time at it you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.149 
to spend a little extra time at it you
can<00:01:14.490> learn<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.409> fake<00:01:16.409> cast<00:01:16.710> drills<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
can learn to do it to fake cast drills I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.499 
can learn to do it to fake cast drills I
mean<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.700> counter<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
mean look at this counter right here it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
mean look at this counter right here it
is<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:19.170> overwhelming<00:01:19.560> when<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.100> come

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
is a little overwhelming when you come

three five point three times in that one
handle<00:02:18.439> turn<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.129> here<00:02:19.310> I've<00:02:19.400> got<00:02:19.430> an

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
handle turn and right here I've got an

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.550 
handle turn and right here I've got an
example<00:02:20.090> for<00:02:20.209> us<00:02:20.359> took<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.569> piece<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.810> paper<00:02:21.049> to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
example for us took a piece of paper to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.289 
example for us took a piece of paper to
where<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.709> can<00:02:21.859> count<00:02:22.159> how<00:02:22.609> many<00:02:22.700> times<00:02:22.879> that

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
where I can count how many times that

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.809 
where I can count how many times that
spool<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.810> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.019> turn<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.530> my<00:02:24.950> one<00:02:25.310> real

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
spool is going to turn in my one real

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.589 
spool is going to turn in my one real
revolution

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
revolution

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.140

so<00:02:26.959> right<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.290> we're<00:02:27.439> going<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.799> got<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.219> two

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
so right here we're going we got one two

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.259 
so right here we're going we got one two
three<00:02:29.530> four<00:02:31.510> five<00:02:33.040> six<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.180> a

very<00:02:56.150> important<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.659> the<00:02:56.840> first<00:02:57.109> one<00:02:57.260> that

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
very important that's the first one that

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.959 
very important that's the first one that
I'm<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.709> adjust<00:02:57.889> I've<00:02:58.609> got<00:02:58.849> the

I'm going to adjust I've got the

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.699 
I'm going to adjust I've got the
Magnetic<00:02:59.569> cast<00:02:59.810> control<00:03:00.139> right<00:03:00.319> here<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
Magnetic cast control right here on the

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.459 
Magnetic cast control right here on the
side<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.219> can<00:03:01.489> fine-tune<00:03:02.090> what<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.230> lure

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
side I can fine-tune what to the lure

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.349 
side I can fine-tune what to the lure
that<00:03:03.530> I'm<00:03:03.739> using<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.489> I've<00:03:04.639> also<00:03:04.849> got<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
that I'm using then I've also got the

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.929 
that I'm using then I've also got the
centrifugal<00:03:05.959> weights<00:03:06.889> on<00:03:07.189> the<00:03:07.370> spool<00:03:07.669> right

centrifugal weights on the spool right

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.140 
centrifugal weights on the spool right
here<00:03:08.120> these<00:03:08.359> are<00:03:08.510> awesome<00:03:08.689> I<00:03:09.079> can<00:03:09.590> adjust

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
here these are awesome I can adjust

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.759 
here these are awesome I can adjust
resistance<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.510> spool<00:03:11.810> very<00:03:12.260> important

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
resistance on that spool very important

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.050 
resistance on that spool very important

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
when you're adjusting these you don't in

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.539 
when you're adjusting these you don't in
just<00:03:14.299> one<00:03:14.599> if<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.169> just<00:03:15.500> want<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.859> have<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.219> adjust

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
just one if I just want I have to adjust

the second one opposite side everything

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.430 
the second one opposite side everything
has<00:03:18.979> to<00:03:19.010> stay<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.430> balance<00:03:19.609> right<00:03:19.970> here<00:03:20.440> drag

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
has to stay in balance right here drag

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.069 
has to stay in balance right here drag
drag<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.190> very<00:03:22.400> important<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.870> more

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
drag is very important the more

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.719 
drag is very important the more
expensive<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.739> reel<00:03:24.889> you<00:03:25.069> got<00:03:25.250> generally

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
expensive to the reel you got generally

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.280 
expensive to the reel you got generally
the<00:03:25.849> better<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.329> drag<00:03:26.599> system<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.109> going<00:03:27.229> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the better the drag system is going to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.899 
the better the drag system is going to
be<00:03:27.500> how<00:03:27.859> many<00:03:27.949> times<00:03:28.280> have<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.519> had<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:28.729> big
