have an overseas education to to kind of

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.649 
have an overseas education to to kind of
be<00:01:00.269> due<00:01:01.229> to<00:01:01.769> absorb<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.639> different<00:01:03.059> culture<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
be due to absorb a different culture and

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.210 
be due to absorb a different culture and
then<00:01:03.870> try<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> learn<00:01:04.320> something<00:01:04.379> open<00:01:05.100> your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
then try to learn something open your

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.680 
then try to learn something open your
mind<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> never<00:01:06.270> had<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
mind a little bit but I never had that

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.100 
mind a little bit but I never had that
chance<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.490> instead<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.550> I<00:01:08.750> offset<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.780> by

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
chance so instead I I offset that by

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.110 
chance so instead I I offset that by
doing<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.800> traveling<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:11.910> say<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
doing a lot of traveling I would say I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.940 
doing a lot of traveling I would say I
very<00:01:12.450> diverse<00:01:12.870> opinions<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.620> lot<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
very diverse opinions about a lot of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
very diverse opinions about a lot of
things<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> amount<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
things because of the amount of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
things because of the amount of
different<00:01:15.930> traveling<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.530> different

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I I guess traveling was always a big

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.000 
I I guess traveling was always a big
part<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> me<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.080> my<00:01:52.290> parents<00:01:52.560> were<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
part of me because my parents were the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.680 
part of me because my parents were the
kind<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.580> believed<00:01:53.910> in<00:01:54.120> bringing<00:01:54.510> your

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
kind that believed in bringing your

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.590 
kind that believed in bringing your
children<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.620> were<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:56.010> young<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
children when you were very young so and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
children when you were very young so and
every<00:01:58.430> experience<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.670> had<00:01:59.700> traveling<00:02:00.330> I've

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.560

always<00:02:00.659> come<00:02:01.020> back<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.590> notable<00:02:02.570> memory

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
could see how that worked every error

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.530 
could see how that worked every error
how<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.310> changed<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.790> how<00:04:03.940> people<00:04:04.299> view

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
before the camera came about that kind

before the camera came about that kind
of<00:04:09.700> artwork<00:04:10.030> was<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.630> only<00:04:10.810> way<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.320> people

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
of artwork was the only way for people

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.250 
of artwork was the only way for people
to<00:04:11.680> kind<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.220> remember<00:04:12.940> how<00:04:13.600> things<00:04:13.900> were<00:04:14.079> like

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
to kind of remember how things were like

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.130 
to kind of remember how things were like
then<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.640> could<00:04:15.819> see<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.660> craft

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
then and and you could see the craft

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.879 
then and and you could see the craft
that<00:04:17.260> went<00:04:17.500> into

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
that went into

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.709 
that went into
that<00:04:18.159> people<00:04:18.519> really<00:04:18.819> went<00:04:19.120> all<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.569> make

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:19.719 
that people really went all out to make

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.050 
that people really went all out to make
a<00:04:20.139> scene<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:20.799> alive<00:04:21.129> as<00:04:21.159> possible<00:04:21.819> and<00:04:21.939> then

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
a scene as alive as possible and then

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.239 
a scene as alive as possible and then
how<00:04:22.270> are<00:04:22.509> gradually<00:04:23.169> progress<00:04:23.349> and<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.009> see<00:04:24.219> a

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:24.249 
how are gradually progress and I see a

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.040 
how are gradually progress and I see a
lot<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.759> as<00:04:24.909> a<00:04:24.939> basis<00:04:25.300> for<00:04:25.330> photography

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
lot of that as a basis for photography

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.809 
lot of that as a basis for photography
now<00:04:26.259> and<00:04:26.499> I<00:04:26.889> think<00:04:27.129> that's<00:04:27.279> also<00:04:27.669> something

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
now and I think that's also something

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.209 
now and I think that's also something
that's<00:04:28.060> missing<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.779> it's<00:04:29.349> if<00:04:29.740> people<00:04:30.099> get

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
that's missing and it's if people get

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.800 
that's missing and it's if people get
opportunity<00:04:30.759> i<00:04:30.789> always<00:04:31.060> tell<00:04:31.270> people<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.719> as

sculpture that that that would give you

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.029 
sculpture that that that would give you
that<00:05:04.840> oh<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.169> know<00:05:05.289> that's<00:05:05.529> different<00:05:05.889> I

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
that oh you know that's different I

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.649 
that oh you know that's different I
would<00:05:06.460> say<00:05:06.669> I'm<00:05:06.789> not<00:05:06.819> different<00:05:07.210> than

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
would say I'm not different than

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.689 
would say I'm not different than
Malaysians<00:05:08.349> I'm<00:05:08.500> just<00:05:08.710> more<00:05:08.830> open-minded<00:05:09.189> to

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
Malaysians I'm just more open-minded to

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.490 
Malaysians I'm just more open-minded to
strange<00:05:10.029> things<00:05:10.330> or<00:05:10.659> all<00:05:11.020> things<00:05:11.319> that<00:05:11.439> are

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
strange things or all things that are

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.129 
strange things or all things that are
uncommon<00:05:11.949> which<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:12.759> guess<00:05:12.969> when<00:05:13.629> comparing

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
uncommon which I guess when comparing

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.550 
uncommon which I guess when comparing
the<00:05:14.169> leisure<00:05:14.409> to<00:05:14.560> Malaysians<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.669> maybe<00:05:15.969> other

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
the leisure to Malaysians to maybe other

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.689 
the leisure to Malaysians to maybe other
countries<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.770> may<00:05:17.919> not<00:05:18.129> be<00:05:18.279> as<00:05:18.370> open-minded

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
countries we may not be as open-minded

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.510 
countries we may not be as open-minded
as<00:05:18.999> we<00:05:19.210> think<00:05:19.389> Rihanna<00:05:19.810> so<00:05:20.319> and<00:05:20.589> it's<00:05:21.310> good

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
as we think Rihanna so and it's good

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.360 
as we think Rihanna so and it's good
that<00:05:21.729> travel<00:05:22.569> helps<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:23.080> but<00:05:23.319> I<00:05:23.529> I<00:05:24.039> do

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
that travel helps that but I I do

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.129 
that travel helps that but I I do
advocate<00:05:25.060> traveling<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.750> right<00:05:25.900> way<00:05:26.080> you

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
advocate traveling the right way you

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.950 
advocate traveling the right way you
know<00:05:26.409> people<00:05:26.889> travel<00:05:27.339> and<00:05:27.610> they<00:05:28.240> actually<00:05:28.419> try

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
know people travel and they actually try

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.499 
know people travel and they actually try
to<00:05:28.990> understand<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.830> culture<00:05:30.009> I<00:05:30.509> can't

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
to understand that culture I can't

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.969 
to understand that culture I can't
answer<00:05:31.659> for<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.080> other<00:05:32.199> countries<00:05:32.589> of<00:05:32.770> course

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
answer for the other countries of course

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.559 
answer for the other countries of course
but<00:05:33.159> I<00:05:33.219> think<00:05:33.520> in<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:33.789> lesions<00:05:34.149> we<00:05:34.389> don't

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
but I think in the lesions we don't

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.570 
but I think in the lesions we don't
spend<00:05:35.259> a<00:05:35.379> lot<00:05:35.529> of<00:05:35.560> time<00:05:35.620> understanding<00:05:36.339> we

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
spend a lot of time understanding we

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.730 
spend a lot of time understanding we
spend<00:05:36.879> a<00:05:36.969> lot<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.149> time<00:05:37.270> just<00:05:37.740> experiencing

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
spend a lot of time just experiencing

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.399 
spend a lot of time just experiencing
without<00:05:39.009> thinking<00:05:39.399> and<00:05:39.639> I<00:05:40.629> think<00:05:40.930> photography

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
without thinking and I think photography

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.679 
without thinking and I think photography
is<00:05:41.469> the<00:05:41.649> same<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:42.099> lot<00:05:42.759> of<00:05:42.879> Malaysians<00:05:43.360> tend<00:05:43.569> to

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
is the same a lot of Malaysians tend to

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.929 
is the same a lot of Malaysians tend to
shoot<00:05:44.039> photos<00:05:45.039> without<00:05:45.279> thinking<00:05:45.759> you<00:05:45.849> know

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
shoot photos without thinking you know

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.329 
shoot photos without thinking you know
they<00:05:46.509> take<00:05:46.719> a<00:05:46.750> camera<00:05:47.229> it's<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> digital<00:05:48.129> camera

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
they take a camera it's a digital camera

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
they take the camera and they point at

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.929 
they take the camera and they point at
something<00:05:50.919> and<00:05:51.219> they<00:05:51.580> should<00:05:51.759> like<00:05:51.909> a

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:51.939 
something and they should like a

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.360 
something and they should like a
thousand<00:05:52.360> events<00:05:52.620> like<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.649> machine<00:05:53.860> gun<00:05:54.009> right

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
thousand events like a machine gun right

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
they shoot everything but they don't

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.409 
they shoot everything but they don't
actually<00:05:56.889> think<00:05:57.129> about<00:05:57.399> the<00:05:57.699> photo<00:05:57.909> they

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
actually think about the photo they

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.700 
actually think about the photo they
don't<00:05:58.629> actually<00:05:58.870> think<00:05:58.930> about<00:05:59.169> what<00:05:59.529> they're
