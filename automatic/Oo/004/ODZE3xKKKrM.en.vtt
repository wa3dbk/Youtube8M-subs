cloud-based Prime in the future but for

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
cloud-based Prime in the future but for
now<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.700> first<00:00:41.790> unity<00:00:42.510> game<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
now my very first unity game was a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
now my very first unity game was a
subatomic<00:00:43.469> King<00:00:44.010> rural<00:00:44.370> tour<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.969> wanted

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
subatomic King rural tour and I wanted

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
subatomic King rural tour and I wanted
to<00:00:45.450> test<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.079> porting<00:00:46.590> thats<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.070> well<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to test out porting thats as well it's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.010 
to test out porting thats as well it's
actually<00:00:47.670> complete<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> game<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> i<00:00:48.780> could

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
actually complete the game that i could

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
actually complete the game that i could
release<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> Uyeda<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:52.280> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
release it when the Uyeda comes up and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.510 
release it when the Uyeda comes up and
so<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.280> duel<00:00:56.280> stick

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so as you can see the duel stick

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
so as you can see the duel stick
controls<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.360> fine<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> arrows<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
controls work just fine the arrows a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.930 
controls work just fine the arrows a
little<00:00:59.760> jumpy<00:01:00.649> that's<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:02.129> fault<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.670> haven't

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
little jumpy that's my fault I haven't

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.200 
little jumpy that's my fault I haven't
done<00:01:03.059> anything<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.570> smooth<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> input<00:01:04.290> yet

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
done anything to smooth the input yet

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.520 
done anything to smooth the input yet
but<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.360> remains<00:01:06.780> pretty<00:01:07.049> playable<00:01:09.200> now<00:01:10.200> if

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
but it remains pretty playable now if

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
but it remains pretty playable now if
you're<00:01:10.680> unfamiliar<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:11.520> subatomic

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
now the longer you go without ripping

the<00:01:54.650> porting<00:01:54.980> process<00:01:55.010> for<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:55.730> was

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
the porting process for this was

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.000 
the porting process for this was
relatively<00:01:56.840> painless<00:01:56.990> took<00:01:57.530> me<00:01:57.650> longer<00:01:57.890> than

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
relatively painless took me longer than

relatively painless took me longer than
I<00:01:58.160> thought<00:01:58.420> but<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.500> mostly<00:02:01.490> my<00:02:01.700> fault<00:02:02.440> Tim

the<00:02:49.420> Saturday<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.019> get<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.379> thing<00:02:50.590> running

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the Saturday to get this thing running

the Saturday to get this thing running
on<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.840> wheel<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:56.319> I'm<00:02:56.470> feeling<00:02:56.799> pretty

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
on the wheel and so I'm feeling pretty

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.420 
on the wheel and so I'm feeling pretty
ready<00:02:57.459> for<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.849> create<00:02:58.360> game<00:02:58.599> jam<00:02:59.250> next<00:03:00.250> week
