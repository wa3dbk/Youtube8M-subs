00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
spreadable because that way it will

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.929 
spreadable because that way it will
cream<00:01:50.109> beautifully<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.979> really<00:01:51.280> easily<00:01:51.759> with

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
cream beautifully and really easily with

cream beautifully and really easily with
the<00:01:52.030> sugar<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.469> add<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.950> sugar<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.840> your

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
the sugar so just add the sugar to your

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.719 
the sugar so just add the sugar to your
butter<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.469> you<00:01:56.590> can<00:01:56.770> either<00:01:56.920> use<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.460> wooden

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
butter and you can either use a wooden

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.219 
butter and you can either use a wooden
spoon<00:01:57.939> or<00:01:58.329> I'm<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.960> use<00:01:59.079> an

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
spoon or I'm just going to use an

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.050 
spoon or I'm just going to use an
electric<00:01:59.320> mixer<00:01:59.859> so<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.219> won't<00:02:00.429> talk<00:02:00.759> while

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
electric mixer so I won't talk while

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.389 
electric mixer so I won't talk while
this<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.359> mixing<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.530> idea<00:02:02.829> is<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> clean

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
this is mixing but the idea is to clean

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.940 
this is mixing but the idea is to clean
this<00:02:03.729> until<00:02:04.149> it's<00:02:04.270> really<00:02:04.600> really<00:02:05.289> smooth<00:02:05.649> and

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
this until it's really really smooth and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.980 
this until it's really really smooth and
light<00:02:06.219> and<00:02:06.520> fluffy

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.870 

don't<00:02:12.990> rush<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.650> stage<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.340> longer<00:02:14.760> you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
don't rush this stage the longer you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.670 
don't rush this stage the longer you
take<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.180> whisk<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.020> butter<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.380> sugar<00:02:16.620> until

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
take to whisk the butter and sugar until

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
take to whisk the butter and sugar until
it's<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.340> light<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.790> creamy<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> better

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
it's really light and creamy the better

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's really light and creamy the better
texture<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:20.330> cake<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.600> be<00:02:21.630> because<00:02:22.050> you've

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
texture your cake will be because you've

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.600 
texture your cake will be because you've
got<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.500> incorporate<00:02:22.740> lots<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.520> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
got to incorporate lots of it and you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.550 
got to incorporate lots of it and you
shouldn't<00:02:23.850> feel<00:02:24.180> any<00:02:24.210> granules<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> sugar<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
shouldn't feel any granules of sugar it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.390 
shouldn't feel any granules of sugar it
should<00:02:25.740> be<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.340> really<00:02:26.370> creamy<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.220> then

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
should be really really creamy and then

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.110 
should be really really creamy and then
break<00:02:29.700> four<00:02:30.090> eggs<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.900> whisk<00:02:31.380> them<00:02:32.120> gently

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
break four eggs and whisk them gently

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.750 
break four eggs and whisk them gently
and<00:02:33.560> again<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:35.010> should<00:02:35.340> be<00:02:35.490> at<00:02:35.580> room

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and again they should be at room

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.970 
and again they should be at room
temperature<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.870> add<00:02:37.080> freezing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
temperature because if you add freezing

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
temperature because if you add freezing
cold<00:02:38.190> eggs<00:02:38.430> straight<00:02:38.820> from<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> fridge<00:02:39.390> into

cold eggs straight from the fridge into

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.140 
cold eggs straight from the fridge into
your<00:02:40.110> butter<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.610> make<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> butter

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
your butter it will just make the butter

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210 
your butter it will just make the butter
hard<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.020> you're<00:02:43.170> more<00:02:43.350> likely<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.770> get<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
hard and you're more likely to get the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
hard and you're more likely to get the

tablespoon full of cocoa instead so it's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.840 
tablespoon full of cocoa instead so it's
a<00:03:36.240> really<00:03:36.570> versatile<00:03:37.080> recipe

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
so then I'm just going to fold flour

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.720 
so then I'm just going to fold flour
into<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:47.020> butter<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.410> sugar<00:03:47.590> egg<00:03:48.250> mixture

into the butter and sugar egg mixture
using<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.900> sort<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.170> figure<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.650> eight<00:03:50.800> motion

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
using a sort of figure of eight motion

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670 
using a sort of figure of eight motion
so<00:03:53.950> what<00:03:54.250> you're<00:03:54.370> trying<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.760> do<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.410> fold<00:03:56.410> the

so what you're trying to do is fold the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.210 
so what you're trying to do is fold the
mixture<00:03:56.830> over<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.850> keep<00:03:58.120> all<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.380> air<00:03:59.710> in

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
mixture over to keep all of the air in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.630 
mixture over to keep all of the air in
the<00:04:00.490> mixture<00:04:01.030> now<00:04:01.830> for<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.920> perfect<00:04:03.160> sponge

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
the mixture now for the perfect sponge

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.330 
the mixture now for the perfect sponge
you<00:04:03.820> might<00:04:04.000> want<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:04.270> weigh<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.620> sponge<00:04:05.920> tins

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
you might want to weigh the sponge tins

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.920 
you might want to weigh the sponge tins
and<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> mixture<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.450> make<00:04:07.480> sure<00:04:07.780> you've<00:04:07.900> got

equal<00:04:08.410> quantity<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:08.980> each<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.510> that's<00:04:10.690> only

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
equal quantity in each but that's only

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.100 
equal quantity in each but that's only
if<00:04:11.500> you're<00:04:12.600> wanting<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.660> win<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.900> competition

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
gently smooth it out till it reaches the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.600 
gently smooth it out till it reaches the
sides<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.820> tin<00:04:22.000> no<00:04:22.570> need<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:24.520> it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
sides of the tin no need to get it

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.210 
sides of the tin no need to get it
perfectly<00:04:25.000> smooth<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.770> will<00:04:27.100> all

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
perfectly smooth because it will all

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.610 
perfectly smooth because it will all
melt<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.880> oven<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.330> find<00:04:28.570> its<00:04:28.780> own<00:04:28.930> level

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
melt in the oven and find its own level

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.380 
melt in the oven and find its own level
so<00:04:29.920> there's<00:04:30.100> no<00:04:30.220> need<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> worry<00:04:30.670> about<00:04:30.820> it

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
so there's no need to worry about it

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.910 
so there's no need to worry about it
and<00:04:31.770> then<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.280> goes<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.850> oven<00:04:34.920> 180

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920
