player<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.940> started<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> build<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
player and as we started to build that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
player and as we started to build that
world<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.410> had<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> island<00:02:04.800> we<00:02:05.100> had<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
world that we had the island we had the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
world that we had the island we had the
Solari<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.390> scavengers<00:02:06.929> he<00:02:07.320> started<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
Solari and the scavengers he started to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
Solari and the scavengers he started to
realize<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.160> had<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.519> canvas<00:02:08.910> great

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
realize that we had this canvas great

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
realize that we had this canvas great
warring<00:02:09.750> factions<00:02:10.170> great<00:02:10.380> landscapes<00:02:10.920> yeah

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
warring factions great landscapes yeah

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.920 
warring factions great landscapes yeah
we<00:02:11.580> had<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.820> these<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.360> awesome<00:02:12.390> places

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
we had all these really awesome places

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300 
we had all these really awesome places
but<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.380> all<00:02:13.530> about<00:02:13.620> traversal<00:02:14.220> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
but it was all about traversal and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.680 
but it was all about traversal and
single<00:02:14.640> player<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:15.090> start<00:02:15.300> looking<00:02:15.390> at<00:02:15.570> that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
single player we start looking at that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.830 
single player we start looking at that
we<00:02:15.750> thought<00:02:16.050> wow<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.250> about<00:02:17.430> multiplayer

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
part of the genesis of that was lara

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.759 
part of the genesis of that was lara

downloadable a smaller scale project and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
downloadable a smaller scale project and
that<00:02:31.980> allowed<00:02:32.489> us<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.760> sort<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.239> take<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
that allowed us to sort of take the

that allowed us to sort of take the
risks<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.170> we<00:02:34.470> wouldn't<00:02:34.799> necessarily<00:02:34.890> take

light was our fix our short it's the

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.789 
light was our fix our short it's the
idea<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.690> whilst<00:02:40.230> you're<00:02:40.440> building<00:02:40.739> your

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
idea that whilst you're building your

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.199 
idea that whilst you're building your
big<00:02:40.950> project<00:02:41.340> you're<00:02:41.430> always<00:02:41.670> thinking<00:02:41.820> about

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
big project you're always thinking about

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.120 
big project you're always thinking about
that<00:02:42.390> next<00:02:42.660> thing<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.470> also<00:02:43.590> allowed<00:02:43.950> us<00:02:43.980> to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that next thing what also allowed us to

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.130 
that next thing what also allowed us to
be<00:02:44.280> able<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.610> start<00:02:45.180> understanding<00:02:45.420> co-opting

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
be able to start understanding co-opting

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.600 
be able to start understanding co-opting

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
one of the very first time here them in

one of the very first time here them in
their<00:02:50.910> ear<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.240> they<00:02:51.300> were<00:02:51.390> having<00:02:51.720> fun<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
as a result of that that led to us

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.900 
as a result of that that led to us
thinking<00:02:54.300> about<00:02:54.450> multiplayer<00:02:55.880> hopefully<00:02:56.880> our

thinking about multiplayer hopefully our

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.950 
thinking about multiplayer hopefully our
single<00:02:57.300> player<00:02:57.450> experience<00:02:57.480> we're

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
single player experience we're

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.720 
single player experience we're
delivering<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> very<00:02:58.860> sort<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
delivering is a very sort of

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.480 
delivering is a very sort of
single-player<00:03:00.510> solitary<00:03:01.410> immersive<00:03:02.040> type<00:03:02.310> of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
single-player solitary immersive type of

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.890 
single-player solitary immersive type of
experience<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.180> at<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.390> same<00:03:03.540> time<00:03:03.720> we

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
experience but at the same time we

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.840 
experience but at the same time we
believed<00:03:04.260> tomb<00:03:04.860> raiding<00:03:05.070> together<00:03:05.580> with

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
believed tomb raiding together with

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.180 
believed tomb raiding together with
friends<00:03:06.060> would<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.450> fun<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.110> training<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.010> think

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
friends would be fun to training I think

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.140 
friends would be fun to training I think
that's<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> first<00:03:08.550> time<00:03:08.610> I've<00:03:08.790> ever<00:03:08.820> heard

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's the first time I've ever heard

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.210 
that's the first time I've ever heard
that<00:03:09.240> Sarah<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.380> fun<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.190> know

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that Sarah like that it's fun you know

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.310 
that Sarah like that it's fun you know
packs<00:03:11.580> climbing<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.330> zip<00:03:12.510> lining<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
packs climbing and zip lining and the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.900 
packs climbing and zip lining and the
traversal<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.520> there<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
traversal that we get in there and the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.210 
traversal that we get in there and the
traps<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.570> me<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> was<00:03:15.870> very<00:03:16.020> sad<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:17.040> have

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
traps for me it was very sad to have

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.520 
traps for me it was very sad to have
that<00:03:17.400> catch-22<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.810> would<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.020> great<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.260> do

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
that catch-22 of it would be great to do

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.440 
that catch-22 of it would be great to do
this<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.860> multiplayer<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.209> can't

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
this in multiplayer but we just can't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.120 
this in multiplayer but we just can't
split<00:03:21.780> our<00:03:21.930> resources<00:03:22.350> like<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.980> that's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
split our resources like that and that's

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.770 
split our resources like that and that's
how<00:03:23.220> widest<00:03:23.520> Montreal<00:03:23.880> came<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.660> hit

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
how widest Montreal came about we hit

player<00:03:26.489> everybody<00:03:26.850> was<00:03:26.940> gelling<00:03:27.270> together

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
player everybody was gelling together

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.850

really<00:03:27.750> well<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.260> wasn't<00:03:28.560> something<00:03:28.709> that

really well and it wasn't something that
