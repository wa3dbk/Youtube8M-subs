rear I don't think it does and I think
it<00:02:20.360> sends<00:02:20.540> an<00:02:20.660> extra<00:02:20.900> signal<00:02:21.230> there<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:22.460> brake

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
it sends an extra signal there the brake

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.390 
it sends an extra signal there the brake
light<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.780> i<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.140> have<00:02:24.320> nothing<00:02:25.190> no

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
light so i have to have nothing no

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490 
light so i have to have nothing no
brakes<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.240> i'm<00:02:26.690> hoping<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.080> break<00:02:27.260> like

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
brakes all and i'm hoping to break like

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.280 
brakes all and i'm hoping to break like
that<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.580> obviously<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.210> little<00:02:29.420> tricky

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
that so obviously it's a little tricky

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.780 
that so obviously it's a little tricky
to<00:02:30.320> get<00:02:30.500> away<00:02:30.710> with<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> up<00:02:31.550> killer

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
to get away with that on a up killer

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
to get away with that on a up killer

make<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.370> left<00:02:52.610> turn<00:02:52.870> I'll<00:02:53.870> take<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> good

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
make a left turn I'll take a good

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.569 
make a left turn I'll take a good
position<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.980> gives<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.370> maximum

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
position that gives you maximum

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.429

little<00:03:00.079> bit<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.840> sometimes<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.959> will<00:03:03.110> actually

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
little bit and sometimes I will actually

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.470 
little bit and sometimes I will actually
even<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:03.860> I'll<00:03:04.190> actually

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.580 

that's<00:03:08.080> just<00:03:08.349> too

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
that's just too

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.160 
that's just too
create<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.370> little<00:03:10.640> movement<00:03:10.910> because<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
create a little movement because the
