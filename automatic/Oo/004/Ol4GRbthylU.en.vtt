go down your hair so immediately I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.249 
go down your hair so immediately I
thought<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.130> were<00:01:35.250> awesome<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:36.150> were<00:01:36.259> six

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
thought they were awesome they were six

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
thought they were awesome they were six
pounds<00:01:37.770> each<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.400> they're<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.090> bit

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pounds each so they're a little bit

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
pounds each so they're a little bit
pricey<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.320> guess<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
pricey but then I guess if you just

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
pricey but then I guess if you just
wanted<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> add<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:41.939> color<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.420> hair

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
wanted to add some color to your hair

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
wanted to add some color to your hair
for<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> night<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> couple<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.939> days

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
for like a night or a couple of days

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.960 
for like a night or a couple of days
then<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> bad<00:01:46.710> investment<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.729> much

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
then it's not a bad investment is much

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
then it's not a bad investment is much
better<00:01:48.119> than<00:01:48.390> dyeing<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.049> hair<00:01:49.140> permanently

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
better than dyeing your hair permanently

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.109 
better than dyeing your hair permanently
if<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> problem<00:01:50.790> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
if that was going to be a problem for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
if that was going to be a problem for
you<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.420> terms<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:53.130> school<00:01:53.460> or

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you in terms of work or school or

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.630 
you in terms of work or school or
whatever<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.540> although<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> say<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
whatever and although I have to say that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
whatever and although I have to say that
I<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.689> ridiculous<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I do think it's kind of ridiculous that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.469 
I do think it's kind of ridiculous that
you<00:01:58.380> can't<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.909> different<00:01:59.909> College<00:02:00.149> like

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
hair like blue or pink at school and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.679 
hair like blue or pink at school and
things<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.270> how<00:02:03.420> does<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
things like that because how does it

onto<00:02:59.130> lighter<00:02:59.610> colored<00:03:00.060> hair<00:03:00.299> so<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.019> worth

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
onto lighter colored hair so it is worth

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.660 
onto lighter colored hair so it is worth
bearing<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.680> mind<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.160> darker

bearing in mind if you have darker
colored<00:03:02.940> hair<00:03:03.120> then<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.780> might<00:03:03.930> need<00:03:04.049> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
colored hair then you might need to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.440 
colored hair then you might need to
apply<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> chalk<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.269> same

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
apply more of the chalk to get the same

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.330 
apply more of the chalk to get the same
effect<00:03:06.599> so<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.650> worth<00:03:07.829> bearing<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.280> mind

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
effect so that is worth bearing in mind

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.390

now<00:06:44.500> they're<00:06:45.460> basically<00:06:46.090> there's<00:06:46.720> like<00:06:46.840> tiny

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
now they're basically there's like tiny

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.960 
now they're basically there's like tiny
little<00:06:47.260> flecks<00:06:47.710> of<00:06:47.890> pink<00:06:48.130> when<00:06:48.490> I've<00:06:48.610> grabbed

little flecks of pink when I've grabbed

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.010 
little flecks of pink when I've grabbed
sections<00:06:49.630> but<00:06:49.980> mostly<00:06:50.980> not<00:06:51.910> at<00:06:52.030> all<00:06:52.270> they<00:06:52.600> this

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
sections but mostly not at all they this

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.530 
sections but mostly not at all they this
is<00:06:53.290> fab<00:06:53.740> I'm<00:06:54.100> really<00:06:54.820> really<00:06:54.970> impressed<00:06:55.150> with

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
is fab I'm really really impressed with

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.840 
is fab I'm really really impressed with
these<00:06:55.690> as<00:06:56.140> you<00:06:56.320> can<00:06:56.470> see<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:56.890> roots<00:06:57.160> haven't

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
these as you can see the roots haven't

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.270 
these as you can see the roots haven't
taken<00:06:58.120> much<00:06:58.480> colour<00:06:58.810> and<00:06:59.200> I<00:06:59.710> think<00:06:59.950> that's<00:07:00.160> a

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
taken much colour and I think that's a

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.010 
taken much colour and I think that's a
mixture<00:07:00.610> of<00:07:00.730> the<00:07:01.030> fact<00:07:01.210> that<00:07:01.270> they're<00:07:01.480> darker

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
mixture of the fact that they're darker

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.250 
mixture of the fact that they're darker
and<00:07:02.260> also<00:07:02.830> and<00:07:03.220> that<00:07:03.640> I<00:07:03.670> didn't<00:07:04.090> really<00:07:04.450> get

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
and also and that I didn't really get

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.840 
and also and that I didn't really get
into<00:07:05.440> the<00:07:05.740> roots<00:07:05.950> as<00:07:06.130> much<00:07:06.310> as<00:07:06.460> I<00:07:06.550> did<00:07:06.730> the

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
into the roots as much as I did the

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.640 
into the roots as much as I did the
length<00:07:07.060> but<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.420> think<00:07:07.660> if<00:07:07.780> you<00:07:07.870> persevered<00:07:08.470> I

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
length but I think if you persevered I

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.620 
length but I think if you persevered I
think<00:07:08.890> you<00:07:09.040> could<00:07:09.220> kind<00:07:09.490> of<00:07:09.640> get<00:07:10.150> more<00:07:10.360> into

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
think you could kind of get more into

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.060 
think you could kind of get more into
the<00:07:10.720> roots<00:07:10.930> and<00:07:11.140> really<00:07:11.290> like<00:07:11.560> rub<00:07:11.830> it<00:07:11.920> on

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
the roots and really like rub it on

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.250 
the roots and really like rub it on
there<00:07:12.310> but<00:07:12.490> and<00:07:12.730> I<00:07:12.940> focused<00:07:13.750> more<00:07:13.930> on<00:07:13.990> the

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
there but and I focused more on the

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.760 
there but and I focused more on the
length<00:07:14.470> so<00:07:15.360> so<00:07:16.360> impressed<00:07:16.900> with<00:07:17.050> these<00:07:17.260> and

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
length so so impressed with these and

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.070 
length so so impressed with these and
what<00:07:18.010> do<00:07:18.100> you<00:07:18.160> guys<00:07:18.280> think<00:07:18.340> let<00:07:18.880> me<00:07:18.940> know<00:07:19.060> and<00:07:19.720> I
