00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.330
 I 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 the cup there 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.620
 hi everyone is welcome on my 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 chain today I'm doing a horrible 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.430
 it's the hormone with its status 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 presents of the collection is wise figaro 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 in here is the box we find here a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 meaning that presents them here the logo 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 20 years of sailor moon sailor logo 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 moon here a water sticker animate 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 only who certifies that it is a version 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.780
 official here we have other logos with 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.530
 bandas we wrote the one by ruling on 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.670
 the side here is the top of the box the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.150
 side the other side and here is the back of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270
 the box 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.360
 so we find his different faces 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 what make up the box and different 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.390
 poses of these their station so that's it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 for the box I will now open 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.310
 so here is what the box on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 down here a little notice to go up 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.410
 the figurine is the base here is three 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.320
 different faces 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.970
 of course we have his basic face here in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 has extra hands in the number of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.520
 eight so top 10 in total and what is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.900
 now they have added a little bit 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 plastic to keep hands 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.570
 as long as they walk around in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.830
 so super convenient box because 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.119
 it was really annoying when was it 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.659
 not there when we put them back in the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.520
 box and back in at its base and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.920
 sapho the silent glay they are so here you go 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 for the earth kavanagh box now 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 I'm going to take a break to do the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.890
 review so here is a first break that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.590
 I did 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.560
 that's all simple so without his fake 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 in the hands of bright ground because I 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.850
 now shows you the figurine of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.190
 closer so she has a hairstyle at 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.920
 square so I 'm not speechless but 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 she has small purple reflections on 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.170
 his hair does not send me too much 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.239
 so purple eyes so I'll you 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 shows his uniform a medallion sound is 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:27.670
 beautiful and one of colored wine 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.640
 dark burgundy at the back 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.640
 we have small epaulettes as nice 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.790
 and I show you his lace-up boots 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 his pedestal seller saturn v kissima his 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.060
 sig 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 so that's it for the climax now to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.600
 present do another for you 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.910
 show then here is the second break 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 so I will add sapho who is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.730
 really gorgeous 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.730
 so all silver I show you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 I changed the expression of his face 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.540
 so to remove it's simple we remove 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.190
 the front of the hair also a 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.500
 delimitation so I show his nano 6g 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.730
 not do it to go back I already did 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.799
 in the old reviews really knows 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.930
 if you want to see if I have changed 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.380
 hands so a hand that can 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.440
 so grab sapho and our fist 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.000
 closed the first face was that one 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.859
 I forgot to tell you this is the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.410
 smiling and the to the one expression a 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.280
 a little less happy we will say a little 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.280
 more serious 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.440
 so here I am going to do a third 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.150
 pause and show you so here's the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.130
 third break 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 so there his face is much more 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.380
 angry the open mouth he is 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.820
 prepare to attack then I put the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.550
 hands that helps hold 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.120
 the info here is some chirac is 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.860
 tomorrow so I really like this break 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.160
 but I, my class, I pass cause in 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.540
 think but I like a lot 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.310
 so I'm going to make a last break 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.990
 with his last face with his eyes closed 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.510
 and with other hands not here is a 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.680
 last break with other hands there 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.480
 will only have it now that I have 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.980
 not used to show you that's it 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.270
 because I have not found a break for 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.770
 to do otherwise it was a little too much 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.370
 it's laure bondoux seller jupiter i 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:45.560
 find their hands here so 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:49.160
 simple and face closed eyes so 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.050
 there a basle to a rather calm break 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:57.470
 do we actually feel like I like 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.830
 also by last thing before us 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.360
 to leave 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.040
 I wanted to show you the size of these 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720
 saturn lures so like in the manga 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.310
 in the cartoon she is much more 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.990
 small 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.970
 here she has a head less so 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.950
 frankly she is beautiful this 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.480
 figurine and I'm really happy 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.350
 that she joins my collection and that I 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.300
