footing<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.199> damn<00:00:28.439> things<00:00:29.630> okay

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
footing with these damn things okay

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
footing with these damn things okay
anyway<00:00:32.989> I'm<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.290> sure<00:00:34.469> where<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.680> shutoff

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
anyway I'm not sure where it's shutoff

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.450 
anyway I'm not sure where it's shutoff
on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> other<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
on the other one so we actually have a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840 
on the other one so we actually have a
pretty<00:00:38.700> nice<00:00:38.910> fit<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.670> part<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
pretty nice fit here but part of the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
pretty nice fit here but part of the
challenge<00:00:43.430> with<00:00:44.930> these<00:00:45.930> short<00:00:46.230> reams<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
challenge with these short reams as I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
challenge with these short reams as I
was<00:00:47.489> saying<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.090> dedicated<00:00:48.600> ream

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
was saying I've got this dedicated ream

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
was saying I've got this dedicated ream
this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> 20<00:00:49.289> millimeter<00:00:49.530> ream<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> our<00:00:53.489> goal

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
this is a 20 millimeter ream so our goal

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
this is a 20 millimeter ream so our goal
is<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.329> hair<00:00:54.480> bigger<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:54.899> 20

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is just a hair bigger than 20

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.240 
is just a hair bigger than 20
millimetres<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.129> that's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
millimetres and you can see that's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.729 
millimetres and you can see that's
that's<00:00:56.940> working<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.449> fine<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> problem<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that's working just fine the problem is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.049 
that's working just fine the problem is
when<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.129> him<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> machine<00:01:02.820> shop

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
when you take him into a machine shop

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
when you take him into a machine shop
and<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> line<00:01:04.500> bore

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and they they can do a line bore

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
and they they can do a line bore
basically<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.880> read<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> them

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
basically and they can read both of them

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.300 
basically and they can read both of them
at<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> same<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.619> hone<00:01:07.740> them<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.420> and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
at the same time and hone them out and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:20.770 
at the same time and hone them out and
speaking<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> hone<00:01:14.540> go

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.530 
the stones I want to make sure there's
plenty<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> stones<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:53.479> okay<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
this fits in there is just a little to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
this fits in there is just a little to
one<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> spring<00:01:57.450> tension

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
one and I've got the spring tension

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
one and I've got the spring tension
backed<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.009> don't<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> crank

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
backed off a bit I don't have a crank

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.289 
backed off a bit I don't have a crank
down<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.640> push<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.820> any

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
down I don't want it to push those any

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.550 
down I don't want it to push those any
harder<00:02:03.659> than<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.899> have

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.610 

okay<00:02:12.560> let's<00:02:13.129> see<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:15.260> into<00:02:15.440> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
okay let's see if we can get into the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:32.399 
okay let's see if we can get into the
other<00:02:15.769> one<00:02:15.980> there

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.459 

so<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.590> break<00:02:33.739> hone<00:02:33.920> will<00:02:34.129> work<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.609> fact<00:02:35.469> I'm

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
so the break hone will work in fact I'm

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.869 
so the break hone will work in fact I'm
kind<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.829> thinking<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.189> one<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.430> these<00:02:37.549> sets

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
kind of thinking about one of these sets

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.670 
kind of thinking about one of these sets
I<00:02:38.180> might<00:02:39.019> possibly<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:41.540> try<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
I might possibly just try to do just the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.729 
I might possibly just try to do just the
break<00:02:42.859> hone<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.840> if<00:02:47.230> see<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.260> possibly

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
break hone and see if see if possibly

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.899 
break hone and see if see if possibly
that<00:02:50.409> rings<00:02:51.409> them<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.799> well<00:02:52.010> enough<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.760> know

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
that rings them out well enough you know

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.390 
that rings them out well enough you know
that<00:02:52.939> because<00:02:53.900> that's<00:02:54.200> that's<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:55.189> maybe

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that because that's that's what maybe

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.459 
that because that's that's what maybe
