00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
to wing out my liner and I had to go

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.450 
to wing out my liner and I had to go
over<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:43.320> section<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.800> my<00:03:43.920> eye<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.250> bit

over this section of my eye a little bit

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.440 
over this section of my eye a little bit
because<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.670> went<00:03:44.820> too<00:03:44.880> far<00:03:45.030> down<00:03:45.210> with<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
because I went too far down with the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.720

glitter but the brush is really small

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.480 
glitter but the brush is really small
thin<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.270> it<00:03:48.360> still<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.930> easy<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.190> achieve<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
thin so it still is easy to achieve a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.860 
thin so it still is easy to achieve a
straight<00:03:50.730> line<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.270> then<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.570> my<00:03:51.630> waterline
