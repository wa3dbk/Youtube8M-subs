00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.999
 This is 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.120
 besides, come on music 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 Alex s before I am with a workshop on the topic for us many 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 The players often asked the question if I have a concept for that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 Slip it okay it was the term 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.190
 a film 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 should fill a gap when it is there 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.310
 Percent or maybe over lead 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.280
 one uses for Linz above 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.870
 with our games from the verse into the breach 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.430
 from the Brit woman Emma wife 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 that is, it means it is over 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.690
 should remove a from the rest of the piece 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.480
 around I have two concepts 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.710
 the first concept would be 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.329
 you make a list of top and top ten 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.479
 The records he loves the rattle have heard down or always 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.170
 still on upkeep and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.150
 sift through these unique pieces 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.740
 Aftershocks of such movie 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.930
 around and out of it you build up your rage library, so to speak, the first one 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.890
 Things you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 Percent elsewhere in your band or in other music 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 to throw a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 I'll give you a few examples 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.570
 maybe there are a few older things but I think I am again 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
 save if you hear that 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.159
 "That's already morning at Michel Jackson Word with Cuban so every human being 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.980
 in the world 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.809
 because it has a bit of a clue about music 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.829
 Weisz Vans Trier scored points at Tur Tur Tur 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.829
 then people come out 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.509
 to Prague because there dares usually Land of Confusion is beautiful 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.209
 if you hear 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.019
 that has become dark for orders at the Pretenders 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.309
 it just exists 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.569
 Milestones Signature for Lance 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.749
 which are considered to be absolutely worth copying percent I think about that 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:05.189
 Understand instrument better and percent to understand music better 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.159
 Imagine you have your studio job or have worked four someone 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.089
 forbidden 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.199
 I imagine a bit more Motown here with this piece of smart 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.719
 then you would have to be a musician or drummer as a percent 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.679
 around 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.249
 know exactly what he means with Motown 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.049
 So it should be easy 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.049
 that's the motto and fill 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.399
 that's called butter and feel 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.879
 can not say exactly on which Blatters the ESM has appeared 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.559
 but listen 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.689
 you know what I mean is to be 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.069
 a striking went a striking tiny solo 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.179
 what quite unmistakably continues to musically so that's it 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:04:00.559
 is it a concept the other concept is because you want to move on a bit further 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:04.949
 the creative Ecker enter and that is even a so-called right left 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.179
 concept 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.819
 that means I divide a Falin sixteenth notes when I am in one 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.010
 Sixteenth Guth am 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.019
 and say the right hand 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.729
 make the eighth 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.170
 and the Lemke hand the 16 2 up 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.959
 means in plain text 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.020
 Walter under second under 3 2 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.960
 Interested in that means 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.380
 I ask easily 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.080
 to focus on the left over the left 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.210
 so and now 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.150
 Clyde I just sort of a rhythmic idea that I got out 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.169
 British Telecom can be its own 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.569
 direct suddenly overturned 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.550
 Spiders big 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.099
 just brought London 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.059
 chopped cookbook look 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.059
 that sounds like I'm coming out 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.729
 I dress this rhythmic 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.169
 l like those of the current but there always out there always with the concept 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.199
 there Doc 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.240
 grateful 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.349
 I distribute that to myself 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.009
 and wars too long 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.789
 I create my own films 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.629
 around 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.710
 I think I'm going to do it myself if you take me yourself 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.969
 at one percent 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.460
 For example, in July or in the game before, Chris Early's got it 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.719
 crystallize to the coffee in the house which plays again and again 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.749
 take the new report for 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.120
 and uses the so to speak as well 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.300
 the library of the famous movie 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.789
 and see for yourself what Eurich South is about feeling 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.210
 Okay, have fun looking for the victory with shovels 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.639
 like Siemens again on making music picture
