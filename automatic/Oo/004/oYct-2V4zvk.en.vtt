00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.970 

but<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.720> seems<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.020> fire<00:04:41.470> always<00:04:41.740> cooked

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
restaurants you know then of course the

you<00:06:26.120> know<00:06:26.300> I<00:06:32.409> forgot<00:06:33.409> the<00:06:33.620> term<00:06:33.830> much<00:06:34.520> to<00:06:34.940> be

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
you know I forgot the term much to be

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.890 
you know I forgot the term much to be
desired

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
desired

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.999 
desired
yeah<00:06:38.900> I<00:06:38.930> think<00:06:39.319> they<00:06:39.500> can<00:06:39.620> do<00:06:39.710> a<00:06:39.740> little<00:06:39.830> bit

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
yeah I think they can do a little bit

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.830 
yeah I think they can do a little bit
better<00:06:40.159> on<00:06:40.250> the<00:06:40.340> fries<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:40.819> know<00:06:41.180> maybe<00:06:41.389> make

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
better on the fries you know maybe make

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.200 
better on the fries you know maybe make
it<00:06:42.190> maybe<00:06:43.190> first<00:06:43.430> of<00:06:43.550> all<00:06:43.669> the<00:06:43.729> rice<00:06:43.909> that<00:06:43.940> they

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
it maybe first of all the rice that they

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.270 
it maybe first of all the rice that they
cooked<00:06:44.629> probably<00:06:45.020> like<00:06:45.169> not<00:06:45.409> as<00:06:45.800> much<00:06:46.009> water

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
cooked probably like not as much water

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.920 
cooked probably like not as much water
so<00:06:46.610> he's<00:06:46.729> not<00:06:47.349> sticking<00:06:48.349> like<00:06:48.800> that<00:06:49.069> and<00:06:49.930> to

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
so he's not sticking like that and to

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.089 
so he's not sticking like that and to
put<00:06:51.080> more<00:06:51.199> ingredients<00:06:51.740> in<00:06:51.830> there<00:06:51.919> might<00:06:52.069> be

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
put more ingredients in there might be

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.490 
put more ingredients in there might be
being<00:06:52.340> sprouted<00:06:53.060> some<00:06:53.240> greens<00:06:53.539> pea<00:06:54.080> something

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
being sprouted some greens pea something

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.439 
being sprouted some greens pea something
like<00:06:54.620> that<00:06:54.800> so<00:06:55.520> on<00:06:55.729> the<00:06:55.789> progress<00:06:55.969> is<00:06:56.240> some

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
like that so on the progress is some

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.700 
like that so on the progress is some
have<00:06:56.750> to<00:06:56.840> give<00:06:56.990> they're<00:06:57.139> like<00:06:57.259> a<00:06:57.289> 70<00:06:57.880> 74<00:06:59.620> so<00:07:00.620> the

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
have to give they're like a 70 74 so the

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.740 
have to give they're like a 70 74 so the
fire<00:07:00.919> ones<00:07:01.130> have<00:07:01.250> skin<00:07:01.490> I<00:07:01.729> don't<00:07:01.940> really<00:07:02.539> like

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
fire ones have skin I don't really like

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.339 
fire ones have skin I don't really like
it<00:07:02.960> probably<00:07:03.860> give<00:07:04.130> that<00:07:04.279> like<00:07:04.430> a<00:07:04.569> 70<00:07:05.569> no

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.349 
it probably give that like a 70 no

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.019 
it probably give that like a 70 no
probably<00:07:06.800> more<00:07:06.889> like<00:07:07.039> a<00:07:07.360> 68<00:07:09.190> well<00:07:10.190> so<00:07:10.520> I'm

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:11.029 
probably more like a 68 well so I'm

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.749 
probably more like a 68 well so I'm
happy<00:07:11.389> with<00:07:11.479> the<00:07:11.599> meal<00:07:12.219> let's<00:07:13.219> get<00:07:13.370> to<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.610> hot
