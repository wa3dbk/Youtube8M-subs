00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and open up to the sink now it's the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
and open up to the sink now it's the
season's<00:00:27.119> over<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> install<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
season's over I want to install this

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.600 
season's over I want to install this
machine<00:00:29.900> in<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:31.529> closet<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.279> RV

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
machine in this little closet in this RV

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.920 
machine in this little closet in this RV
and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.809> pretty

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and I want to do it so it's pretty

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.420 
and I want to do it so it's pretty
simple<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> use<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> fight<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
simple to use and I got to fight the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
simple to use and I got to fight the
hoses<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> drainage<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.140> good

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
hoses and drainage and and all that good

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
hoses and drainage and and all that good
stuff<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.489> probably<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
stuff so this is probably gonna be a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
stuff so this is probably gonna be a
two-part<00:00:39.360> video<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.410> first<00:00:40.649> part<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.920> going

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
two-part video the first part is going

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
two-part video the first part is going
to<00:00:41.129> show<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.460> idea<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.850> theory<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to show you my idea in theory and the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.360 
to show you my idea in theory and the
second<00:00:43.590> part<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.800> probably<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> show

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
second part is probably going to show

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
second part is probably going to show
you<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.670> installation<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> had<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you is installation and what I had to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
you is installation and what I had to
change<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.469> different<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
change and what was different but the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
change and what was different but the
idea<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.020> sit<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.350> machine<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
idea is to sit this machine in this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
idea is to sit this machine in this
closet<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.300> closet<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> sits

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
closet and it's just a closet that sits

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.330 
closet and it's just a closet that sits
above<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> furnace<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> an<00:00:53.190> old

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
above the furnace this is an old

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
above the furnace this is an old
Winnebago<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> 1970<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> watch<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.199> videos

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
value away but I do want to hook this up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.350 
value away but I do want to hook this up
so<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.589> semi<00:01:05.280> permanent<00:01:05.729> install<00:01:06.180> and

so that it's semi permanent install and
I<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> pull<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.619> every<00:01:07.860> time<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I don't have to pull it out every time I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
I don't have to pull it out every time I
use<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.310> cuz<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:10.200> clause<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
use it cuz I do use it this clause it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
use it cuz I do use it this clause it's
perfect<00:01:11.130> thus<00:01:11.340> artbeads<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.030> great<00:01:12.299> big

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
perfect thus artbeads got two great big

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140 
perfect thus artbeads got two great big
huge<00:01:12.780> closets<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.340> ideal<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
huge closets so this is ideal for this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
huge closets so this is ideal for this
and<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> still<00:01:15.659> gives<00:01:15.810> me<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.380> large

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and it still gives me a really large

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
and it still gives me a really large
closet<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.400> behind<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> hold<00:01:18.390> my

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
closet that's behind me to hold my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840 
closet that's behind me to hold my
clothes<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.979> quite<00:01:20.310> frankly<00:01:20.580> rev

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
clothes and this is quite frankly rev

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
clothes and this is quite frankly rev
and<00:01:20.939> keeping<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.270> machine<00:01:21.570> anyhow<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and keeping this machine anyhow but the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
and keeping this machine anyhow but the
concept<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> layout<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.900> RV<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
concept is if the layout of this RV is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:25.940 
concept is if the layout of this RV is
pretty<00:01:25.500> different

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
pretty different

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
pretty different
mmm<00:01:26.720> it's<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:28.590> next<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.159> fridge<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mmm it's right next to this fridge and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
mmm it's right next to this fridge and
underneath<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> fridge<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> cavity<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
underneath the fridge is a cavity that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
underneath the fridge is a cavity that
you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.640> right<00:01:35.970> next<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
they used to do it 1970 but I could tap
on<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> plug<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.159> water<00:02:02.430> without

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
on so that's a plug for my water without

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.810 
on so that's a plug for my water without
much<00:02:03.119> problems<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.590> machine<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.369> sure<00:02:05.579> a

machine has two inlets on top one is for
the<00:02:44.530> spin<00:02:44.770> cycle<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.910> for<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.210> washing

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840

previously is you just have these hoses

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.040 
previously is you just have these hoses
but<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.460> just<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.330> homes<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.750> here<00:03:07.930> and

but you just like one homes in here and

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.360 
but you just like one homes in here and
you<00:03:08.110> plug<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.380> into<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> sink<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.070> fill

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
you plug it into the sink and you fill

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
you plug it into the sink and you fill
this<00:03:09.520> up<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.940> then<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.110> run<00:03:11.320> your<00:03:11.470> machine

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
this up and then you run your machine

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.200 
this up and then you run your machine
and<00:03:11.950> then<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.100> move<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.580> connection<00:03:13.030> from

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
and then you move the connection from

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.810 
and then you move the connection from
here<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.750> over<00:03:13.930> here<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.560> then<00:03:15.250> as<00:03:15.640> you're

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
here so over here and then as you're

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.430 
here so over here and then as you're
spinning<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.300> if<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.630> want<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> rinse<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.260> or

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.690 
give an extra rinse you just you know
add<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.300> few<00:03:19.690> seconds<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.140> water<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.740> you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
add a few seconds of water and and you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.920 
add a few seconds of water and and you
do<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.000> couple<00:03:22.060> times<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.660> you're<00:03:22.780> done

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
do that a couple times and you're done

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.710 
do that a couple times and you're done
so<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.800> thought<00:03:24.640> well<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.880> want<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.240> set<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.510> up

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
so I thought well I want to set this up

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.010 
so I thought well I want to set this up
pretty<00:03:26.650> simple<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:28.120> wanna<00:03:28.660> make<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> easy

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
pretty simple and I wanna make it easy

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.190 
pretty simple and I wanna make it easy
to<00:03:29.230> use<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:30.250> here's<00:03:30.610> what<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> come<00:03:31.390> up<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.570> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
to use so here's what I come up with and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.240 
to use so here's what I come up with and
I<00:03:32.380> might<00:03:32.560> change<00:03:32.740> my<00:03:32.860> mind

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
I might change my mind

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.760 
I might change my mind
but<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.670> what<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.820> get<00:03:33.970> right<00:03:34.180> now<00:03:34.770> I've

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
but this is what I get right now I've

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.010 
but this is what I get right now I've
got<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> couple<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.640> electric<00:03:37.060> valves<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:40.020> they

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
got a couple of electric valves and they

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.310 
got a couple of electric valves and they
are<00:03:41.200> 12<00:03:41.620> volt<00:03:41.830> valves<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.840> basically<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.170> add

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
are 12 volt valves and basically you add

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.990 
are 12 volt valves and basically you add
power<00:03:44.590> they<00:03:44.860> come<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.190> they're<00:03:45.520> pretty<00:03:45.730> simple

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
power they come on they're pretty simple

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.060 
power they come on they're pretty simple
and<00:03:46.360> pretty<00:03:46.390> reliable<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.470> got<00:03:47.680> them<00:03:47.860> off

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
and pretty reliable and I got them off

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.820 
and pretty reliable and I got them off
of<00:03:48.340> ebay<00:03:48.810> did<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:49.959> pay<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.170> lot<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.380> money<00:03:50.470> for

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
of ebay did not pay a lot of money for

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.860 
of ebay did not pay a lot of money for
him<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.520> like<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.090> said<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.270> might<00:03:52.510> change<00:03:52.720> my

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
him and like I said I might change my

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.180 
him and like I said I might change my
mind<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.170> don't<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.440> but<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:53.830> could<00:03:53.890> definitely

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
mind I don't know but I could definitely

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.850 
mind I don't know but I could definitely
mount<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:55.330> underneath<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.680> heater

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
mount this up underneath in that heater

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.190 
mount this up underneath in that heater
compartment<00:03:57.540> actually<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.750> left<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.110> it

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
compartment actually to the left of it

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.530 
compartment actually to the left of it
which<00:03:59.320> would<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.850> under<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.880> fridge<00:04:01.209> there's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
which would be under the fridge there's

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.490 
which would be under the fridge there's
plenty<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.810> room<00:04:01.959> down<00:04:02.170> in<00:04:02.290> turn<00:04:02.380> out

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
plenty of room down in turn out

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.830 
plenty of room down in turn out
something<00:04:02.800> like<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.070> in<00:04:03.250> there<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.150> there

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
something like this in there and there

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.220 
something like this in there and there
he<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:04.990> if<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.500> feed<00:04:05.770> water<00:04:05.980> into<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.850> guy<00:04:07.230> and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
he is if I feed water into this guy and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.900 
he is if I feed water into this guy and
yeah<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.740> would<00:04:08.860> be<00:04:08.890> my<00:04:09.100> cold<00:04:09.340> water<00:04:09.550> inlet

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
yeah that would be my cold water inlet

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.870 
yeah that would be my cold water inlet
and<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.840> come<00:04:11.020> out<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.290> sides<00:04:11.560> went<00:04:12.490> into<00:04:12.790> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and I come out the sides went into the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.760 
and I come out the sides went into the
washing<00:04:13.060> machine<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.570> one<00:04:14.080> into<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.410> rinse

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
washing machine and one into this rinse

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.880 
washing machine and one into this rinse
machine<00:04:15.160> then<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.420> could<00:04:16.600> hook<00:04:16.780> up<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.290> switch

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
machine then I could hook up a switch

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.230 
machine then I could hook up a switch
like<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.790> this<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.710> a<00:04:20.710> double<00:04:21.010> throw<00:04:21.430> on

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
like this and this is a double throw on

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.260 
like this and this is a double throw on
hold<00:04:23.020> switch<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.520> have<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.880> hold<00:04:25.000> it

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
hold switch so you have to hold it

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.710 
hold switch so you have to hold it
for<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.169> stay<00:04:26.349> on<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.940> it's<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.389> double

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
for it to stay on and it's it's a double

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.529 
for it to stay on and it's it's a double
pole<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.680> could<00:04:30.069> hook<00:04:30.160> up<00:04:30.400> two<00:04:30.970> motors<00:04:31.300> to

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
pole so you could hook up two motors to

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.040 
pole so you could hook up two motors to
it<00:04:31.660> okay<00:04:32.319> sir<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.520> us<00:04:34.090> Illinois<00:04:34.509> so<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.870> could

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
it okay sir to us Illinois so I could

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.350 
it okay sir to us Illinois so I could
look<00:04:35.139> once<00:04:35.380> Illinois<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.889> here<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.430> once

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
look once Illinois to here and once

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.730 
look once Illinois to here and once
owned<00:04:37.569> a<00:04:37.599> lady<00:04:37.840> here<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.110> think<00:04:38.410> that's<00:04:38.560> right

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
owned a lady here I think that's right

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.749 
owned a lady here I think that's right
I'm<00:04:39.130> trying<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.400> look<00:04:39.490> through<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.699> camera

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
I'm trying to look through the camera

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.189 
I'm trying to look through the camera
and<00:04:40.120> do<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.240> at<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.330> same<00:04:40.509> time<00:04:40.569> actually<00:04:40.990> I

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
and do it at the same time actually I

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.680 
and do it at the same time actually I
think<00:04:41.380> it's<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.710> hearing<00:04:42.039> here<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.940> regardless

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
think it's a hearing here but regardless

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.659 
think it's a hearing here but regardless
you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.289> throw<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> switch<00:04:44.770> one<00:04:44.979> way<00:04:45.130> and

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
you can throw the switch one way and

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.370 
you can throw the switch one way and
it'll<00:04:45.910> trip<00:04:46.090> once<00:04:46.330> Illinois<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:47.050> throw<00:04:47.289> the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
it'll trip once Illinois and throw the

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.809 
it'll trip once Illinois and throw the
switch<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.770> other<00:04:47.860> way<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.340> no<00:04:48.460> trip<00:04:48.699> the

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
switch the other way and no trip the

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.050 
switch the other way and no trip the
other<00:04:48.849> solenoid<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:50.349> if<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.430> had<00:04:51.610> this<00:04:51.759> switch

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
other solenoid so if I had this switch

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.200 
other solenoid so if I had this switch
in<00:04:52.240> there<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.569> could<00:04:52.810> label<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.319> rinse<00:04:54.280> wash

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
in there I could label this rinse wash

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.839 
in there I could label this rinse wash
or<00:04:55.690> vice<00:04:56.259> versa<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.430> doesn't<00:04:57.669> take<00:04:57.789> very

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
or vice versa and it doesn't take very

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.939 
or vice versa and it doesn't take very
long<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> fill<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.659> cavity<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.680> would<00:04:59.800> be<00:04:59.919> a

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
long to fill the cavity so it would be a

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.620 
long to fill the cavity so it would be a
big<00:05:00.159> deal<00:05:00.370> back<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:00.759> -<00:05:00.909> sir<00:05:01.030> my<00:05:01.180> clothes<00:05:01.419> in

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
big deal back there - sir my clothes in

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.659 
big deal back there - sir my clothes in
it<00:05:01.720> hold<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.380> up<00:05:02.530> -<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.770> give<00:05:02.949> them<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.159> water<00:05:03.430> in

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
it hold it up - I give them a water in

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.790 
it hold it up - I give them a water in
it<00:05:03.789> that<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.300> like<00:05:04.569> and<00:05:04.930> then<00:05:05.229> let<00:05:05.500> go<00:05:05.650> of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
it that I that I like and then let go of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.010 
it that I that I like and then let go of
it<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.159> turn<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.970> machine<00:05:07.060> on<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.599> over<00:05:07.810> run

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
it and turn the machine on in over run

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
it and turn the machine on in over run
and<00:05:08.199> then<00:05:09.009> I<00:05:09.190> thought<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.729> know<00:05:09.819> for<00:05:10.060> safety

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and then I thought you know for safety

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.939 
and then I thought you know for safety
majors<00:05:10.720> I'd<00:05:10.930> like<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.199> have<00:05:11.349> just<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.650> one<00:05:11.800> thing

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
majors I'd like to have just a one thing

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.879 
majors I'd like to have just a one thing
on/off<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.699> this<00:05:13.449> is<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.659> 110<00:05:14.169> with<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.500> light<00:05:14.710> in

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
on/off and this is a 110 with a light in

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.559 
on/off and this is a 110 with a light in
it<00:05:15.039> just<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.789> way<00:05:15.909> if<00:05:16.000> you<00:05:16.060> open<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.389> calls

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
it just that way if you open the calls

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:17.820 
it just that way if you open the calls
and<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.810> see<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.080> light<00:05:17.199> on<00:05:17.229> you<00:05:17.560> know<00:05:17.680> the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
and you see the light on you know the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.680 
and you see the light on you know the
machines<00:05:18.099> got<00:05:18.280> powered<00:05:18.669> probably<00:05:19.419> I'll<00:05:19.509> turn

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
machines got powered probably I'll turn

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.189 
machines got powered probably I'll turn
it<00:05:19.810> off

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
it off

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.350 
it off
not<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.830> it's<00:05:20.949> a<00:05:21.039> big<00:05:21.759> deal<00:05:21.940> because<00:05:22.180> it's

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
not that it's a big deal because it's

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.820 
not that it's a big deal because it's
got<00:05:22.509> its<00:05:22.659> own<00:05:22.750> switch<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.530> just<00:05:23.740> like

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
got its own switch but I just like

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.469 
got its own switch but I just like
safety<00:05:24.130> measures<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.880> again<00:05:25.180> these<00:05:25.300> are<00:05:25.449> just

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
safety measures so again these are just

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.689 
safety measures so again these are just
eBay<00:05:25.930> items<00:05:26.289> nothing<00:05:26.740> really<00:05:26.919> expensive<00:05:27.280> I

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
eBay items nothing really expensive I

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.899 
eBay items nothing really expensive I
don't<00:05:28.479> even<00:05:28.539> know<00:05:28.720> if<00:05:28.780> I've<00:05:28.870> used<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.199> box<00:05:29.409> but

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
don't even know if I've used the box but

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.909 
don't even know if I've used the box but
that's<00:05:30.909> how<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.090> got<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.570> equipment<00:05:32.289> so<00:05:32.710> that's

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
that's how I got the equipment so that's

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.290 
that's how I got the equipment so that's
my<00:05:33.099> intention<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:33.699> I<00:05:33.729> think<00:05:33.849> that<00:05:34.090> should<00:05:34.240> be

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
my intention so I think that should be

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.490 
my intention so I think that should be
fairly<00:05:34.960> simple<00:05:35.440> fairly<00:05:35.860> straightforward<00:05:36.580> I

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
fairly simple fairly straightforward I

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.839 
fairly simple fairly straightforward I
do<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.620> second<00:05:38.949> part<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.219> video<00:05:39.310> I'm<00:05:39.669> sure

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
do the second part of the video I'm sure

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.930 
do the second part of the video I'm sure
I'll<00:05:39.969> probably<00:05:40.120> change<00:05:40.419> my<00:05:40.479> ideas<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.940> I'll

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
I'll probably change my ideas and I'll

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.149 
I'll probably change my ideas and I'll
keep<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.240> updated<00:05:43.469> if<00:05:44.469> you<00:05:44.620> guys<00:05:44.800> have<00:05:45.009> any

keep you updated if you guys have any

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.270 
keep you updated if you guys have any

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
ideas to do better let me know and you

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.550 
ideas to do better let me know and you
I'll<00:05:48.400> take<00:05:48.580> ideas<00:05:49.030> and<00:05:49.270> if<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.110> do<00:05:50.259> something

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
I'll take ideas and if you do something

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.140 
I'll take ideas and if you do something
say<00:05:50.710> something<00:05:51.009> really<00:05:51.190> cool<00:05:51.370> if<00:05:51.699> I<00:05:51.789> can<00:05:51.940> use

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
say something really cool if I can use

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.360 
say something really cool if I can use
them<00:05:52.469> you<00:05:53.469> know<00:05:53.530> certainly<00:05:53.830> give<00:05:53.979> you<00:05:54.099> credit

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
them you know certainly give you credit

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.120 
them you know certainly give you credit
and<00:05:54.400> we'll<00:05:54.849> do<00:05:55.000> it
