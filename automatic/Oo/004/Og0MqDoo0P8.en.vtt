00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
been getting a lot of requests recently

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.220 
been getting a lot of requests recently
to<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> pistol<00:00:20.430> only<00:00:20.670> video<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.600> since<00:00:21.990> I'm

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to do a pistol only video and since I'm

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.250 
to do a pistol only video and since I'm
always<00:00:22.410> talking<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.090> mp443<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
always talking about the the mp443 and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.220 
always talking about the the mp443 and
how<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:25.830> trusty<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.640> me<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> should

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
how it's very trusty to me that I should

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
how it's very trusty to me that I should
give<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.890> jump<00:00:29.460> onto<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.760> server

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
give it a go and jump onto a server

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
give it a go and jump onto a server
against<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.050> normal<00:00:31.320> server<00:00:31.800> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
against you know a normal server with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.590 
against you know a normal server with
people<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:32.969> using<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> their

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
people that are using all of their

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
people that are using all of their
primary<00:00:33.960> weapons<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.649> jumping<00:00:35.010> into

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
primary weapons and so not jumping into

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
primary weapons and so not jumping into
you<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> pistol<00:00:35.969> only<00:00:36.149> server<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you a pistol only server because that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.630 
you a pistol only server because that
would<00:00:37.140> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> defeat<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.040> purpose<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
would kind of defeat the purpose of this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
would kind of defeat the purpose of this
challenge<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.140> wasn't<00:00:40.469> exactly<00:00:40.770> sure

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
challenge and so I wasn't exactly sure

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
challenge and so I wasn't exactly sure
how<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> would<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> mean<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.180> done<00:00:42.300> pistol

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
how I would do I mean I've done pistol

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
how I would do I mean I've done pistol
only<00:00:42.899> videos<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> past<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.640> they're

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
only videos in the past but they're

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
only videos in the past but they're
usually<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.739> weapons<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.980> pistols<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.520> do

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
usually with weapons or pistols that do

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.979 
usually with weapons or pistols that do
a<00:00:47.820> lot<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> damage<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.690> did<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:48.960> for

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a lot of damage I think I did one for

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.819 
a lot of damage I think I did one for
the<00:00:49.410> Magnum<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.840> m1911<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> those

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the Magnum or the m1911 and those

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
the Magnum or the m1911 and those
weapons<00:00:53.070> while<00:00:53.579> they<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.969> their

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
weapons while they do have their

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
weapons while they do have their
disadvantages<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> strengths<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
disadvantages one of the strengths of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
disadvantages one of the strengths of
them<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:57.030> hit<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> hard<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
them is that they hit really hard and so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
them is that they hit really hard and so
even<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.460> against<00:00:59.789> someone

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
even if you are going against someone

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
even if you are going against someone
who<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.300> using<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> primary<00:01:01.079> weapon<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
who was using a primary weapon you can

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
who was using a primary weapon you can
usually<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
usually get by it's just because of the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
usually get by it's just because of the
high<00:01:04.080> damage<00:01:04.350> model<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> weapons<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
high damage model of the weapons but the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
high damage model of the weapons but the
mp443<00:01:07.100> doesn't<00:01:08.100> hit<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.369> hard<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
mp443 doesn't hit as hard as them and so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
mp443 doesn't hit as hard as them and so
I<00:01:09.240> wasn't<00:01:09.810> exactly<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.590> successful<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I wasn't exactly sure how successful I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.359 
I wasn't exactly sure how successful I
was<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.530> challenge<00:01:13.890> was

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
was going to be but this challenge was

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.219 
was going to be but this challenge was
an<00:01:14.909> absolute<00:01:15.630> blast

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
an absolute blast

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.469 
an absolute blast
I<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.619> destroying<00:01:17.460> people<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.030> went<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.270> some

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I was destroying people I went on some

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
I was destroying people I went on some
of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> most<00:01:18.780> ridiculous<00:01:19.380> kill<00:01:19.770> streaks<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of the most ridiculous kill streaks that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
of the most ridiculous kill streaks that
I<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:20.580> shouldn't<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> deserved<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.380> go

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
I probably shouldn't have deserved to go

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
I probably shouldn't have deserved to go
on<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:23.939> truly<00:01:24.479> amazing

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
on but it was it was truly amazing

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
on but it was it was truly amazing
so<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> mp443<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.240> average<00:01:27.960> stats

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so the mp443 kind of has average stats

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.630 
so the mp443 kind of has average stats
when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> compare<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> other

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
when you compare it to all of the other

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
when you compare it to all of the other
pistols<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> game<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.960> 25

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pistols in the game it's gonna do 25

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
pistols in the game it's gonna do 25
damage<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:32.009> close<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.460> shot<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
damage up close a shot and then as you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.300 
damage up close a shot and then as you
move<00:01:34.020> further<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> further<00:01:34.560> away<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
move further and further away and it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.340 
move further and further away and it
gets<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> its<00:01:35.880> lowest<00:01:36.450> damage<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
gets to its lowest damage it's going to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
gets to its lowest damage it's going to
do<00:01:37.470> thirteen<00:01:37.979> point<00:01:38.310> seven<00:01:38.579> five<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.509> you're

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
do thirteen point seven five so you're

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030 
do thirteen point seven five so you're
gonna<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.500> close<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> mean

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
gonna want to use this up close I mean

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.429 
gonna want to use this up close I mean
that<00:01:41.250> makes<00:01:41.400> sense<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.570> pistol<00:01:43.079> weapon

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that makes sense this is a pistol weapon

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.840 
that makes sense this is a pistol weapon
you're<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> try<00:01:44.310> sniping

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you're not gonna want to try sniping

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
you're not gonna want to try sniping
people<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> distance<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> those<00:01:46.530> stats

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
people from a distance and those stats

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.460 
people from a distance and those stats
just<00:01:47.189> verify<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> type<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.450> gameplay<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just verify that type of gameplay it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
just verify that type of gameplay it
also<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.189> decent<00:01:50.579> rounds<00:01:51.119> per<00:01:51.299> minute<00:01:51.540> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
also has a decent rounds per minute it's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.710 
also has a decent rounds per minute it's
gonna<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.350> RPM<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.950> 400<00:01:53.909> which<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> once

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
gonna have an RPM of 400 which is once

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.050 
gonna have an RPM of 400 which is once
again<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:55.439> average<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.820> worst

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
again very average it's not the worst

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.719 
again very average it's not the worst
those<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.290> Magnum<00:01:58.829> clocking<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> at

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
those would be the Magnum clocking in at

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.020 
those would be the Magnum clocking in at
180<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> best<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.159> g18<00:02:02.520> which

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
180 and then the best is the g18 which

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.289 
180 and then the best is the g18 which
if<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.270> believe<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.009> 900<00:02:05.009> rounds<00:02:05.280> per<00:02:05.430> minute<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
if I believe is 900 rounds per minute so

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.089 
if I believe is 900 rounds per minute so
it's<00:02:06.479> loon<00:02:06.750> once<00:02:06.930> again<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.560> average<00:02:07.950> in

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's loon once again very average in

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's loon once again very average in
that<00:02:08.129> department<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.239> what's<00:02:09.390> nice<00:02:09.539> about

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that department but what's nice about

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720 
that department but what's nice about
this<00:02:09.989> weapon<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:11.009> least<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.250> me<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this weapon is that at least for me it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.930 
this weapon is that at least for me it
just<00:02:11.760> feels<00:02:12.270> really

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
just feels really

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.100 
just feels really
sistent<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.570> think<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.960> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
sistent and I think one of the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
sistent and I think one of the
contributing<00:02:14.530> factors<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
contributing factors of that is that it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150 
contributing factors of that is that it
has<00:02:16.270> 18<00:02:16.660> rounds<00:02:16.960> its<00:02:17.080> magazine<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.950> gives

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
has 18 rounds its magazine so it gives

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.430 
has 18 rounds its magazine so it gives
you<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> lot<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.850> room<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.450> error<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.320> gives

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
you a lot of room for error and it gives

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.200 
you a lot of room for error and it gives
you<00:02:20.620> plenty<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.980> bullets<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.610> take<00:02:21.790> out<00:02:21.970> even

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
you plenty of bullets to take out even

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.540 
you plenty of bullets to take out even
multiple<00:02:22.630> targets<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.320> are<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:24.310> you're<00:02:24.430> on

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
multiple targets if you are if you're on

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.730 
multiple targets if you are if you're on
fire<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.210> accuracy<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.780> true<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.680> also

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
fire and your accuracy is true but also

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.760 
fire and your accuracy is true but also
its<00:02:27.430> recoil<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.330> extremely<00:02:29.140> manageable<00:02:29.740> I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
its recoil is extremely manageable I

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.320 
its recoil is extremely manageable I
mean<00:02:29.950> it's<00:02:30.100> it's<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> deviate<00:02:30.970> on

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
mean it's it's not going to deviate on

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.090 
mean it's it's not going to deviate on
the<00:02:31.450> left<00:02:31.720> or<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:31.990> very<00:02:32.440> significantly

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
the left or the right very significantly

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.060 
the left or the right very significantly
it<00:02:33.460> has<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> very<00:02:34.420> low<00:02:34.750> first<00:02:35.200> shot<00:02:35.560> initial

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
it has a very low first shot initial

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.070 
it has a very low first shot initial
recoil<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.450> easy<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.840> manage

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
recoil so it's really easy to manage

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.410 
recoil so it's really easy to manage
this<00:02:38.410> weapon<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.760> nice<00:02:39.910> aspects

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
this weapon and one of the nice aspects

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
this weapon and one of the nice aspects
of<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.780> basically<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.530> find<00:02:41.860> an<00:02:42.040> enemy

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
of it is basically if you find an enemy

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.490 
of it is basically if you find an enemy
all<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.210> have<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.900> aim<00:02:44.170> for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
all you really have to do is aim for

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
all you really have to do is aim for
like<00:02:44.860> their<00:02:45.040> upper<00:02:45.370> chest<00:02:45.670> or<00:02:45.910> their<00:02:46.060> neck<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
like their upper chest or their neck and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.500 
like their upper chest or their neck and
fire<00:02:47.440> two<00:02:47.830> or<00:02:47.980> three<00:02:48.190> shots<00:02:48.400> off<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.970> because

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
fire two or three shots off and because

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
fire two or three shots off and because
of<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.690> headshot<00:02:50.050> multiplier<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:51.100> just

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
of the headshot multiplier and just

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.430 
of the headshot multiplier and just
because<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.730> very<00:02:52.000> slight<00:02:52.360> recoil<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.260> aim

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
because that very slight recoil you aim

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
because that very slight recoil you aim
right<00:02:53.710> there<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.520> second<00:02:55.030> bullet<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.360> going

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
right there the second bullet is going

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
right there the second bullet is going
to<00:02:55.600> give<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.840> head<00:02:55.960> shot<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:56.770> drop

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to give you a head shot and you can drop

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
to give you a head shot and you can drop
your<00:02:57.310> target<00:02:57.640> technically<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.270> two<00:02:58.450> rounds

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
your target technically in two rounds

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.470 
your target technically in two rounds
but<00:02:59.050> usually<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.070> three<00:03:00.310> shots<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.910> you're

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
but usually just three shots and you're

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.970 
but usually just three shots and you're
good<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.840> go<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.650> are<00:03:02.740> really

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
good to go and if you are really

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.350 
good to go and if you are really
accurate<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:03.490> he<00:03:03.610> can<00:03:03.760> pull<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.030> off<00:03:04.090> on

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
accurate and he can pull that off on

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.880 
accurate and he can pull that off on
multiple<00:03:04.750> targets<00:03:05.110> you're<00:03:05.440> gonna<00:03:05.560> drop

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
multiple targets you're gonna drop

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.430 
multiple targets you're gonna drop
people<00:03:06.310> fairly<00:03:07.120> quickly<00:03:07.570> at<00:03:07.870> least<00:03:08.080> within

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
people fairly quickly at least within

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.830 
people fairly quickly at least within
close<00:03:08.770> range<00:03:08.950> engagements<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.690> was

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
close range engagements and that was

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.150 
close range engagements and that was
kind<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> what<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> was<00:03:11.410> trying<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.740> do<00:03:11.920> when<00:03:12.130> I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
kind of what I was trying to do when I

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.760 
kind of what I was trying to do when I
was<00:03:12.280> playing<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.850> strike<00:03:13.570> at<00:03:13.810> Karkand<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.560> had

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
was playing on strike at Karkand I had

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.760 
was playing on strike at Karkand I had
just<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:15.610> ridiculous<00:03:16.270> kill<00:03:16.630> streak<00:03:16.930> where<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
just this ridiculous kill streak where I

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.590 
just this ridiculous kill streak where I
actually<00:03:17.950> ran<00:03:18.430> out<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.700> ammunition<00:03:19.150> by<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
actually ran out of ammunition by the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.150 
actually ran out of ammunition by the
end<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.230> would<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.410> run<00:03:20.680> around<00:03:20.830> all

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
end of it I would just run around all

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.070 
end of it I would just run around all
over<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> place<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.510> could<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.780> been<00:03:22.810> do

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
over the place and it could have been do

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.290 
over the place and it could have been do
for<00:03:23.350> many<00:03:23.709> reasons<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.459> think<00:03:24.489> maybe<00:03:24.970> some

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
for many reasons and I think maybe some

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.970 
for many reasons and I think maybe some
of<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.510> enemies<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.230> was<00:03:26.410> going<00:03:26.680> against

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
of the enemies that I was going against

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.440 
of the enemies that I was going against
were<00:03:27.070> kind<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.370> clueless<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.910> wasn't<00:03:28.120> weren't

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
were kind of clueless and wasn't weren't

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.000 
were kind of clueless and wasn't weren't
exactly<00:03:28.720> sure<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.140> was<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.500> on<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.770> times

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
exactly sure what was going on at times

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.890 
exactly sure what was going on at times
but<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.610> was<00:03:30.790> trying<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.239> extremely

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.030 
aggressive and to try to take my enemies
by<00:03:34.270> surprise<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.110> that's<00:03:35.560> kind<00:03:35.770> of<00:03:35.830> how<00:03:35.980> you

was trying to take advantage of is that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.810 
was trying to take advantage of is that
the<00:03:54.519> mp443<00:03:55.150> has<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.840> very<00:03:56.350> fast<00:03:56.980> reload<00:03:57.610> time

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
the mp443 has a very fast reload time

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.720 
the mp443 has a very fast reload time
it's<00:03:58.030> short<00:03:58.269> reload<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.860> 1.35<00:03:59.860> seconds<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.640> if

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
it's short reload is 1.35 seconds so if

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.880 
it's short reload is 1.35 seconds so if
you<00:04:00.790> have<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> bullet<00:04:01.360> still<00:04:01.870> in<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.500> chamber

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
you have a bullet still in the chamber

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.040 
you have a bullet still in the chamber
it's<00:04:03.040> gonna<00:04:03.160> be<00:04:03.430> very<00:04:03.820> quick<00:04:04.150> but<00:04:04.600> even<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:04.959> you

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
it's gonna be very quick but even if you

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.630 
it's gonna be very quick but even if you
go<00:04:05.170> through<00:04:05.320> your<00:04:05.470> entire<00:04:05.530> rounds<00:04:06.250> it's<00:04:06.430> only

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
go through your entire rounds it's only

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.759 
go through your entire rounds it's only
gonna<00:04:06.790> take<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.090> 1.6<00:04:07.989> seconds<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:08.709> you

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
gonna take you 1.6 seconds and so you

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.920 
gonna take you 1.6 seconds and so you
always<00:04:08.980> feel<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:09.640> you're<00:04:10.060> ready<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.510> go<00:04:10.660> and

always feel like you're ready to go and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.259 
always feel like you're ready to go and
even<00:04:11.470> if<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.920> aren't<00:04:12.340> able<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.730> take<00:04:12.910> out<00:04:13.060> that

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
even if you aren't able to take out that

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.330 
even if you aren't able to take out that
target<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.050> can<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.380> quickly<00:04:14.590> pop<00:04:14.950> behind

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
target you can just quickly pop behind

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.800 
target you can just quickly pop behind
the<00:04:15.459> corner<00:04:16.299> or<00:04:16.390> something<00:04:16.570> like<00:04:16.750> that

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the corner or something like that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.539 
the corner or something like that
they're<00:04:17.440> assuming<00:04:17.950> you're<00:04:18.100> going<00:04:18.310> through<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
they're assuming you're going through a

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.430 
they're assuming you're going through a
really<00:04:18.850> long<00:04:18.880> animation<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:19.900> their<00:04:20.019> primary

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
really long animation with their primary

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.260 
really long animation with their primary
weapon<00:04:20.590> they<00:04:21.130> get<00:04:21.310> really<00:04:21.520> aggressive<00:04:21.760> on<00:04:22.120> you

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
weapon they get really aggressive on you

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.640 
weapon they get really aggressive on you
and<00:04:22.419> then<00:04:22.539> you're<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:22.990> popping<00:04:23.169> right<00:04:23.440> back

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
and then you're just popping right back

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.350 
and then you're just popping right back
out<00:04:23.890> there<00:04:24.400> through<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:25.000> kind<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.240> that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
out there through the kind of that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.390 
out there through the kind of that
sprint<00:04:25.690> animation

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
sprint animation

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.830 
sprint animation
they're<00:04:26.729> not<00:04:26.910> ready<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.600> then<00:04:27.720> you're

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
they're not ready for and then you're

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.060 
they're not ready for and then you're
able<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.110> take<00:04:28.290> him<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.590> can't<00:04:28.800> tell<00:04:28.949> you

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
able to take him out I can't tell you

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.820 
able to take him out I can't tell you
how<00:04:29.160> many<00:04:29.220> times<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:30.050> slayed<00:04:31.050> my<00:04:31.440> enemies

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
how many times I slayed my enemies

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.260 
how many times I slayed my enemies
simply<00:04:32.070> because<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.520> caught<00:04:32.850> them<00:04:33.060> off-guard

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
simply because I caught them off-guard

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.600 
simply because I caught them off-guard
because<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.229> think<00:04:34.530> they<00:04:34.680> were<00:04:34.740> assuming<00:04:35.340> that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
because I think they were assuming that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.340 
because I think they were assuming that
I<00:04:35.639> was<00:04:35.760> reloading<00:04:36.240> but<00:04:36.570> because<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.080> using

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
I was reloading but because I was using

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.409 
I was reloading but because I was using
of<00:04:37.470> course<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.830> pistol<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.850> ready<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.180> go<00:04:39.389> and

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
of course a pistol I was ready to go and

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.200 
of course a pistol I was ready to go and
just<00:04:39.720> basically<00:04:40.680> under<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> second<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:41.940> so<00:04:42.180> I

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
just basically under a second and so I

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.000 
just basically under a second and so I
try<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.449> take<00:04:42.600> advantage<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.290> as<00:04:43.470> much<00:04:43.949> as

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
try to take advantage of that as much as

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.280 
try to take advantage of that as much as
I<00:04:44.250> possibly<00:04:44.669> could<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.240> as<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.020> guys<00:04:46.110> can

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
I possibly could so as you guys can

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.050 
I possibly could so as you guys can
imagine<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:47.130> reason<00:04:47.460> why<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.639> was

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
imagine the reason why this was

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.060 
imagine the reason why this was
difficult<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.960> reason<00:04:49.260> why<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.440> was<00:04:49.800> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
difficult and the reason why this was a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.129 
difficult and the reason why this was a
challenge<00:04:50.580> was<00:04:51.060> because<00:04:51.419> of<00:04:51.600> course<00:04:51.840> the

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
challenge was because of course the

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.740 
challenge was because of course the
mp443<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.460> secondary<00:04:53.970> weapon<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.600> I'm

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
mp443 is a secondary weapon and I'm

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.330 
mp443 is a secondary weapon and I'm
gonna<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.990> going<00:04:55.260> against<00:04:55.560> players<00:04:55.800> who<00:04:56.160> are

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
gonna be going against players who are

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.400 
gonna be going against players who are
using<00:04:56.729> primary<00:04:57.300> guns<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.780> then<00:04:58.199> when<00:04:58.320> that's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
using primary guns and then when that's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.980 
using primary guns and then when that's
all<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:58.919> have<00:04:59.160> I'm<00:04:59.400> not<00:04:59.520> saying<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.910> mp443<00:05:00.600> is

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
all you have I'm not saying the mp443 is

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.379 
all you have I'm not saying the mp443 is
a<00:05:01.289> bad<00:05:01.650> gun<00:05:01.979> by<00:05:02.160> any<00:05:02.340> means<00:05:02.580> but<00:05:02.820> when<00:05:03.240> that's

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
a bad gun by any means but when that's

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.240 
a bad gun by any means but when that's
all<00:05:03.630> are<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.990> are<00:05:04.169> using<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.889> you're<00:05:05.070> always

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
all are you are using and you're always

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.560 
all are you are using and you're always
going<00:05:05.610> against<00:05:05.970> people<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.270> are<00:05:06.389> using

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
going against people that are using

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.930 
going against people that are using
primaries<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.770> not<00:05:08.039> gonna<00:05:08.220> be<00:05:08.430> easy<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.820> go

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
primaries it's not gonna be easy to go

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.370 
primaries it's not gonna be easy to go
on<00:05:09.120> kill<00:05:09.419> streaks<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.840> that's<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.229> know<00:05:10.260> what

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
on kill streaks and that's you know what

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.379 
on kill streaks and that's you know what
makes<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.039> also<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.610> much<00:05:11.789> fun<00:05:11.970> is<00:05:12.120> when<00:05:12.210> you

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
makes this also so much fun is when you

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.420 
makes this also so much fun is when you
do<00:05:12.600> go<00:05:12.810> on<00:05:12.960> those<00:05:13.139> kill<00:05:13.380> streaks<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:14.190> know

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
do go on those kill streaks you know

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.610 
do go on those kill streaks you know
that<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.760> did<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.030> with<00:05:15.449> just<00:05:15.870> your<00:05:16.139> pistol

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
that you did that with just your pistol

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.770 
that you did that with just your pistol
with<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:17.039> your<00:05:17.160> secondary<00:05:17.610> weapon<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.300> so

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
with just your secondary weapon and so

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.600 
with just your secondary weapon and so
what<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.020> required<00:05:19.350> me<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.160> had<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.490> be

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
what it required me to do is I had to be

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.689 
what it required me to do is I had to be
on<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.090> had<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.539> be<00:05:21.860> really<00:05:22.860> accurate<00:05:23.639> and

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
on and I had to be really accurate and

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.510 
on and I had to be really accurate and
as<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.030> said<00:05:24.300> if<00:05:24.539> I<00:05:24.660> was<00:05:24.900> really<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:25.860> my<00:05:26.070> game<00:05:26.310> and

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
as I said if I was really on my game and

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.370 
as I said if I was really on my game and
I<00:05:26.550> was<00:05:26.669> able<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:27.030> get<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> bunch<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.720> headshots

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
I was able to get a bunch of headshots

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.409 
I was able to get a bunch of headshots
I<00:05:28.410> could<00:05:28.860> take<00:05:29.039> out<00:05:29.250> multiple<00:05:29.880> targets<00:05:30.270> with

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
I could take out multiple targets with

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.510 
I could take out multiple targets with
one<00:05:30.599> magazine<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.889> if<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.130> was<00:05:32.220> able<00:05:32.490> to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
one magazine and so if I was able to

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.850 
one magazine and so if I was able to
make<00:05:32.700> everything<00:05:32.970> work<00:05:33.360> if<00:05:33.570> my<00:05:33.750> accuracy<00:05:34.110> was

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
make everything work if my accuracy was

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.990 
make everything work if my accuracy was
just<00:05:35.280> dead-on

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
just dead-on

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.730 
just dead-on

mp443 is just awesome so overall I loved
this<00:06:00.090> challenge<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.690> I<00:06:00.750> realized<00:06:01.199> it<00:06:01.410> wasn't

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
this challenge and I realized it wasn't

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.370 
this challenge and I realized it wasn't
my<00:06:01.830> normal<00:06:02.760> crazy<00:06:03.000> setups<00:06:03.510> like<00:06:03.720> using<00:06:03.960> the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
my normal crazy setups like using the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.490 
my normal crazy setups like using the
EOD<00:06:04.889> bot<00:06:04.919> by<00:06:05.280> itself<00:06:05.610> or<00:06:05.940> shooting<00:06:06.360> mines<00:06:07.139> to

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
EOD bot by itself or shooting mines to

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.140 
EOD bot by itself or shooting mines to
slay<00:06:07.710> my<00:06:07.889> enemies<00:06:08.280> but<00:06:08.699> I<00:06:08.729> thought<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:08.970> was<00:06:09.090> a

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
slay my enemies but I thought it was a

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.879 
slay my enemies but I thought it was a
nice<00:06:09.300> change<00:06:09.330> of<00:06:09.900> pace<00:06:09.960> from<00:06:10.199> what<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:10.770> normally

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
nice change of pace from what I normally

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.189 
nice change of pace from what I normally
do<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.699> it<00:06:11.940> definitely<00:06:12.090> wasn't<00:06:12.419> easy<00:06:12.750> by<00:06:12.990> any

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
do and it definitely wasn't easy by any
