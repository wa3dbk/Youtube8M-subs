00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.189
 imagine where the idea of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 turn out to beer on a table 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.250
 of light bar 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 the project was suggested by a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.549
 association that seeks to recover the value of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.560
 cooking 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.020
 after months of studies and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.760
 This is how the experiments were 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.619
 Beer with a brazilian face 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.910
 always studied a maturation time or 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 be the time to be at rest 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 along with the beer that will not spoil 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 beer also feels when people 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 I could leak pasteurizing and I do not have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.399
 problem of playing beer or a problem 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.559
 resulting from this fault the product 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.780
 all the characteristics of the fruit 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 even the court has a slight taste 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.969
 sweet and at the same time refreshing 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.039
 the production process is practically the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.440
 even from a traditional beer 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.070
 first the water mixed with malt 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.829
 then go hops and yeast only then 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.469
 that the pulp of the açaí is added and yes 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.350
 is the same clothing used to prepare 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.870
 those bowls the juice for it's over 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.630
 leaving a more fruity style beer 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 a red belgian beer tugging at 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.320
 that deal to come out 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.689
 you look a little sweeter a beer 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.549
 dessert a beer joy a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 beer party brazilian with much 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 really cool beer 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 anyone who wants to try this one beer 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.229
 as much as different will have to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 wait a little bit is that the only batch 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 produced was sent to europe for 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 be presented at the tasting event 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.579
 still need approvals 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.799
 Ministry of Agriculture to create new 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.259
 flavors for beers is just one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.150
 tendency in brazil are few 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.549
 companies that risk creating something 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.130
 because traditional ice-cold 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 market leaders since always but the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 owner of this industry 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.790
 recalls that craft beers have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.369
 attracted many consumers and they are the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 target audience for these new products as 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.969
 This variation of beer has already 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 example if you know the services 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.119
 their old beers 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.630
 brazilian 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.729
 now among the apes enter the semis 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.580
 with various flavors but with 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.690
 flavor of coffee tea or chocolate but everything 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.240
 inside the grains 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.390
 there are Europeans and this diversity 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.850
 in fact it will awaken other truths 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 beer and experiments with the new 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.700
 flavors already starting to appear 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.830
 sometimes a little strange 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 citing some examples that people 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.170
 also used how the pepper has already been 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.200
 used for a very legal transfer 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.750
 you see cherry victory linen was 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 cinnamon is there any other 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.680
 beer they have already made use of foot 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.750
 from moleque 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.150
 sometimes with other types of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.780
 beer then the very large validity 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.700
 I've been out of black or traditional 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 seem rather strange for the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.570
 our palate 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.070
 What matters is to gather friends toast and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.070
 drink without excess
