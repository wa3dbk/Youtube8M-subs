so you know that makes sense easier to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
so you know that makes sense easier to
see<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.869> how<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.170> rig

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
see you can kind of see how that rig

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
see you can kind of see how that rig
would<00:01:52.530> work<00:01:52.740> they're<00:01:53.090> basically<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> up

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
would work they're basically put it up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
would work they're basically put it up
at<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:56.000> top<00:01:57.000> where<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.360> line<00:01:57.570> goes<00:01:57.810> through

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
at the top where your line goes through

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.040 
at the top where your line goes through
the<00:01:58.200> end<00:02:00.950> so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.109 

now<00:02:04.980> we<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:05.460> some<00:02:07.220> Celsius<00:02:08.220> cold<00:02:08.880> weather

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
now we got some Celsius cold weather

when<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.460> really<00:02:26.730> bright<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> lake

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
when it's really bright out on the lake

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.360 
when it's really bright out on the lake
I<00:02:27.960> mean<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:30.860> especially<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.220> all

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
I mean you you know especially with all

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.740 
I mean you you know especially with all
the<00:02:32.430> white<00:02:32.730> around<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.360> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the white around you you kind of get the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.380 
the white around you you kind of get the
whitewashed<00:02:34.260> eyes<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.090> was<00:02:36.240> definitely

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
whitewashed eyes so this was definitely

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.500 
whitewashed eyes so this was definitely
help<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.960> seeing<00:02:39.020> next<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.910> got<00:02:42.060> some<00:02:42.270> depth

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
help and seeing next we got some depth

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.400 
help and seeing next we got some depth
finders<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.300> these<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.990> know<00:02:46.110> it's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
finders so with these you know it's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.220 
finders so with these you know it's
fairly<00:02:47.000> fairly<00:02:48.000> simple<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.630> drop<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.050> down

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
fairly fairly simple you drop it down

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.520 
fairly fairly simple you drop it down
when<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.950> hear<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.610> hit<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.910> bottom<00:02:51.410> pull<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
when you hear it hit the bottom pull it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.660 
when you hear it hit the bottom pull it
up<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.860> see<00:02:53.010> how<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.250> line<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.730> got<00:02:55.670> fairly

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
up you see how much line you got fairly

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.110 
up you see how much line you got fairly
simple<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.990> nice<00:02:58.460> especially<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> winter

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
simple but nice especially in the winter

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.470 
simple but nice especially in the winter
when<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.360> can't<00:03:00.600> see<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> bottom<00:03:02.270> we've<00:03:03.270> got

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
when you can't see the bottom we've got

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.590 
when you can't see the bottom we've got
some<00:03:03.660> angel<00:03:03.990> hair<00:03:04.170> grubs<00:03:04.790> also<00:03:05.790> celsius<00:03:06.450> by

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
some angel hair grubs also celsius by

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.090 
some angel hair grubs also celsius by
the<00:03:06.660> way<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.080> far<00:03:07.260> everything<00:03:07.770> I've<00:03:07.890> pulled

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the way so far everything I've pulled

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.340 
the way so far everything I've pulled
out<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.430> package<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.000> Celsius<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.750> they

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
out of this package is Celsius so they

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.070 
out of this package is Celsius so they
might<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.130> many<00:03:11.310> ice<00:03:11.970> fishing<00:03:12.510> you

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
might not have as many ice fishing you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.340 
might not have as many ice fishing you
know<00:03:13.430> vendors<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.930> seems<00:03:16.170> like<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
know vendors so but this seems like a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.080 
know vendors so but this seems like a
decent<00:03:16.560> company<00:03:17.070> according<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.880> what<00:03:17.970> I've

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
decent company according to what I've

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.290 
decent company according to what I've
seen<00:03:18.330> thus<00:03:18.600> far<00:03:19.370> angel<00:03:20.370> hair<00:03:20.520> groves<00:03:20.820> so

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
seen thus far angel hair groves so

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.199 
seen thus far angel hair groves so
obviously<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.440> ice<00:03:22.860> pan<00:03:23.459> fishing<00:03:23.970> which

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
obviously for some ice pan fishing which

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.500 
obviously for some ice pan fishing which
is<00:03:24.360> probably<00:03:24.570> what<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.810> would<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.170> mostly<00:03:29.510> we've

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
is probably what I would do mostly we've

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.030 
is probably what I would do mostly we've
also<00:03:30.660> got<00:03:31.310> let's<00:03:32.310> see<00:03:32.550> some<00:03:32.910> feeding<00:03:33.630> flash<00:03:35.060> so

let me put them together for comparison
here<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.860> these<00:04:36.950> are<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.160> large<00:04:37.370> these<00:04:37.580> are

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
here so these are the large these are
