what<00:00:04.960> is<00:00:05.080> going<00:00:05.350> on<00:00:05.439> guys<00:00:05.710> I<00:00:05.979> Fox<00:00:06.250> here<00:00:06.519> and

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
what is going on guys I Fox here and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.089 
what is going on guys I Fox here and
today<00:00:07.210> I'm<00:00:07.510> going<00:00:07.569> to<00:00:07.750> go<00:00:07.870> over<00:00:08.099> unbreakable

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
today I'm going to go over unbreakable

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.020 
today I'm going to go over unbreakable
damage<00:00:09.550> with<00:00:09.790> Takeda<00:00:10.570> I<00:00:11.070> think<00:00:12.070> Takeda<00:00:12.610> has

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
damage with Takeda I think Takeda has

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.620 
damage with Takeda I think Takeda has
the<00:00:13.540> best<00:00:13.950> unbreakable<00:00:14.950> damage<00:00:15.400> in<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:16.359> game

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
the best unbreakable damage in the game

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.489 
the best unbreakable damage in the game
when<00:00:17.320> he<00:00:17.349> has<00:00:17.619> meter<00:00:18.480> off<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.810> low<00:00:19.989> starters

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:20.499 
when he has meter off of low starters

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.409 
when he has meter off of low starters
and<00:00:20.650> overheads<00:00:21.130> he<00:00:21.310> actually<00:00:21.519> gets<00:00:21.849> pretty

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
and overheads he actually gets pretty

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.529 
and overheads he actually gets pretty
good<00:00:22.689> damage<00:00:23.249> with<00:00:24.249> a<00:00:24.279> couple<00:00:24.669> bars<00:00:24.849> for<00:00:25.329> one

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
good damage with a couple bars for one

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.710 
good damage with a couple bars for one
bar<00:00:25.749> you<00:00:26.019> can<00:00:26.140> get<00:00:26.289> something<00:00:26.470> like<00:00:26.679> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
bar you can get something like this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.489 
bar you can get something like this
twenty-seven<00:00:28.720> percent<00:00:28.839> I<00:00:29.079> think<00:00:29.289> that's<00:00:29.439> the

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:29.499 
twenty-seven percent I think that's the

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.639 
twenty-seven percent I think that's the
best<00:00:29.769> you<00:00:30.009> can<00:00:30.159> do<00:00:30.369> off<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.819> one<00:00:30.999> bar<00:00:31.529> maybe<00:00:32.529> you

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
best you can do off of one bar maybe you

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.810 
best you can do off of one bar maybe you
can<00:00:32.710> do<00:00:32.829> like<00:00:32.950> a<00:00:33.010> run-up<00:00:33.309> throw<00:00:35.820> twenty-eight

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
can do like a run-up throw twenty-eight

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.770 
can do like a run-up throw twenty-eight
percent<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:38.490> this<00:00:39.490> into<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:39.910> run-up<00:00:40.240> throw<00:00:40.540> and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
percent so this into a run-up throw and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400 
percent so this into a run-up throw and
take<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.410> up<00:00:42.060> keep<00:00:43.060> in<00:00:43.210> mind<00:00:43.240> that<00:00:43.540> handbrake

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
take it up keep in mind that handbrake

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.590 
take it up keep in mind that handbrake
the<00:00:44.860> run-up<00:00:45.250> throw<00:00:45.550> but<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:46.030> know<00:00:46.180> if<00:00:46.270> you<00:00:46.390> mix

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
the run-up throw but you know if you mix

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.030 
the run-up throw but you know if you mix
it<00:00:46.750> up<00:00:46.840> if<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:47.140> throw<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.380> left<00:00:47.680> or<00:00:47.860> right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
it up if you throw and left or right

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.790 
it up if you throw and left or right
they<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.520> guess<00:00:49.470> let's<00:00:50.470> see<00:00:50.620> what<00:00:50.710> else

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
they have to guess let's see what else

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.530 
they have to guess let's see what else
you<00:00:51.010> can<00:00:51.040> get<00:00:51.280> one<00:00:51.610> off<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:52.000> overhead<00:00:54.540> 24

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
you can get one off of the overhead 24

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.810 
you can get one off of the overhead 24
and<00:00:56.140> again<00:00:56.770> you<00:00:56.860> can<00:00:56.920> do<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.190> one<00:00:57.340> throw

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450 

so<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.230> so<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so about the same so I'm just going to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
so about the same so I'm just going to
go<00:01:05.580> through<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> recorded<00:01:06.720> stuff

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
go through here all the recorded stuff

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.940 
go through here all the recorded stuff
that<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:09.120> low<00:01:09.360> into<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.170> beef<00:01:10.710> our

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that I have the low into the beef our

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.910 
that I have the low into the beef our
version<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.870> that's<00:01:13.110> forty-one

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
version here and that's forty-one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
version here and that's forty-one
percent<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.910> three<00:01:15.210> bars<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
percent if you have three bars that's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
percent if you have three bars that's
more<00:01:15.930> than<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.229> x-ray<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.190> if<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
more than your x-ray you know so if you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880 
more than your x-ray you know so if you
want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> end<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> match<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.650> you're<00:01:19.650> an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
want to end the match in that you're an

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
want to end the match in that you're an
extra<00:01:20.160> style<00:01:20.430> points<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.410> low<00:01:22.410> can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
extra style points for that one low can

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.440 
extra style points for that one low can
you<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> severe<00:01:23.700> twenty-four<00:01:24.390> percent

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.570 

overhead<00:01:30.450> version<00:01:30.900> keep<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> mind<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:32.130> those

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
overhead version keep in mind all those

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.249 
overhead version keep in mind all those
all<00:01:32.940> these<00:01:33.119> Spears<00:01:33.540> even<00:01:33.900> though<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.110> have

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
all these Spears even though they have

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
all these Spears even though they have
like<00:01:34.470> physical<00:01:34.979> hits<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.940> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like physical hits there they don't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
like physical hits there they don't
allow<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.690> break<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.560> that's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
allow you to break and I think that's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.990 
allow you to break and I think that's
really<00:01:38.160> good<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.789> why<00:01:38.940> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
really good and that's why this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
really good and that's why this
variation<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.899> unique<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:41.280> Lasher

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
variation is so unique because in Lasher

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
variation is so unique because in Lasher
in<00:01:41.970> roaming<00:01:42.420> he<00:01:42.570> couldn't<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.080> anything<00:01:43.320> like

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in roaming he couldn't do anything like

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.480 
in roaming he couldn't do anything like
this<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.220> physical<00:01:46.250> decay<00:01:47.250> de<00:01:47.310> has<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this all these physical decay de has a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.029 
this all these physical decay de has a
lot<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> physical<00:01:48.210> hits<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.710> rest<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> his

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
lot of physical hits in the rest of his

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.790 
lot of physical hits in the rest of his
variations<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.270> you're<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.539> able<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.590> do

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
variations and so you're now able to do

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.710 
variations and so you're now able to do
stuff<00:01:53.039> like<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.610> off<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.820> overhead

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
stuff like this like off the overhead

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.410 
stuff like this like off the overhead
sphere<00:01:55.170> tube<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.830> common<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.690> 26

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
sphere tube are common here 26

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.050 
sphere tube are common here 26
and<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.439> other<00:02:00.590> variation<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.520> here<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
and the other variation to that here is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.679 
and the other variation to that here is
if<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.360> were<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.570> go<00:02:02.689> like<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:04.689> didn't

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
if you were to go like this I didn't

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.060 
if you were to go like this I didn't
record<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.200> one<00:02:06.350> that's<00:02:06.530> twenty-seven

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
record that one that's twenty-seven

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.290 
record that one that's twenty-seven
percent<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:09.429> also<00:02:10.429> run<00:02:10.640> up<00:02:10.870> fourth<00:02:11.870> row<00:02:13.300> for

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
percent and also run up fourth row for

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.760 
percent and also run up fourth row for
slightly<00:02:14.540> more<00:02:14.690> damage<00:02:15.200> twenty-seven

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
slightly more damage twenty-seven

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.270

best tool I believe one of one of his

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.870 
best tool I believe one of one of his
