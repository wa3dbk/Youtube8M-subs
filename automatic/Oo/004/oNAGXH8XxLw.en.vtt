00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that the highest that goes is 720p I

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.670 
that the highest that goes is 720p I
thought<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:31.989> heard<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.620> was<00:02:32.650> 1080i<00:02:33.489> or<00:02:33.580> 1080p

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
thought I heard it was 1080i or 1080p

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.490 
thought I heard it was 1080i or 1080p
but<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:36.430> long<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.700> HD<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.420> good<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:37.989> but<00:02:38.020> I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
but as long as HD it's good for me but I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.050 
but as long as HD it's good for me but I
thought<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:38.950> game<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.250> going<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.489> mad

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
thought this game is going to be mad

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.660 
thought this game is going to be mad
crazy<00:02:40.450> graphics<00:02:41.019> but<00:02:41.370> apparently<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.400> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
crazy graphics but apparently that is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.060 
crazy graphics but apparently that is
only<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.300> PC<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.019> want<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> best<00:02:44.560> graphics

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
only on PC if you want the best graphics

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.880 
only on PC if you want the best graphics
but<00:02:45.250> ps3<00:02:45.910> they<00:02:46.480> confirmed<00:02:46.959> definitely<00:02:47.739> has

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
but ps3 they confirmed definitely has

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.090 
but ps3 they confirmed definitely has
better<00:02:48.160> graphics<00:02:48.430> than<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.810> xbox<00:02:50.230> 360<00:02:50.850> so

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
better graphics than the xbox 360 so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.470 
better graphics than the xbox 360 so
