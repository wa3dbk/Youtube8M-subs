00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:15.120
 hello what is needed 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 the question was the gift the child reacted 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.780
 similarly for sure 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.940
 parents who are now watching this 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.860
 the plot is thought so they can 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.140
 offer one to your child to 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.670
 get a similar reaction but u 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 chinese game manufacturer 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.000
 designers of the company fenming this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.000
 already have your answer 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.110
 perhaps even overdone and jokes 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 a set that the company offers 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 fenming 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.080
 actually very interesting he 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 is a set 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.470
 gears that revolve transmit 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 movement at each other is all very 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.040
 look great and the child can 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.320
 act like 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.310
 his hands and with the help of a motor 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.680
 which comes with a set which i 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.259
 I show you is not the only one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.810
 companies are singing a lot of them all 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.700
 differ in their content by 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 the number of parts on the subject 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.509
 which this set illustrates well here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 for example this set which me now 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.280
 in his hands he is also 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.569
 reproduces different sounds this set 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.399
 suitable for younger children set 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.219
 illustrates the seabed is also here 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.649
 gears rotate and here's another set 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.060
 on also with illustration of the seabed but 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.590
 much more detail here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.899
 and now let's consider one of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 sets in more detail for example we 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.829
 decided to take this one with the jungle and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.810
 an enthusiastic girl and i will tilt to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:57.709
 it was better seen here so the set is made 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 the form of a small suitcase and let us be with you now 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:04.679
 open the box and so just some 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.100
 15-20 minutes and I do not consider myself 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.720
 engineering genius and set ready 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.370
 now you see the top view i 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.220
 I will try to show you it from different 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.260
 angles several times I appeared 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 the idea that something is not Chinese 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 reported somewhere screwed up on the very 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 in fact everything in the collection all grab 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.600
 wonderful 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:34.630
 friend fit in and now show you how 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:37.230
 it all works and so attention all 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.230
 starts to move 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.209
 Well, here's another please view from 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.209
 first person 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.590
 water side turns equally easily 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.620
 hands and it will be a few big myself 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 it's in the foreground 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 actually the designer is enough 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.360
 big and now let's run our 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.280
 game designer from the motor 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.550
 press the button and observe 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.260
 gears moved monkey too 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.900
 one of the monkeys and gets over here 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.090
 tree to another 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.510
 I think that all this will take the child to 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.170
 quite a long time and my colleagues 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 who are around him if they already started 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.890
 dance and dance 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.890
 heads like music 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.280
 let's look at the design with 1 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.680
 radius now I will start clear how 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.720
 way the elements move us wood 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.040
 to another 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 how gears move 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.430
 now as you see we collected 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.459
 the design is a little different wrong 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.370
 how was it collected initially let's 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:18.739
 Now let's start the little motor and see 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:20.720
 will she move now like you 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.610
 see everything moves everything works 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.730
 monkey crawls from one tree to 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.570
 another way, so to say 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.240
 conclusion 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.200
 fenming unusual and original 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.390
 interesting enough designer 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.590
 which is suitable not only for girls but also 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.980
 boy with you baba richard h up 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.980
