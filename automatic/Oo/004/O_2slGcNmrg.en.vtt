 Away outstanding Russian fighter 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.700

 hello new but in order to be 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.640
 understandable already the subsequent conversation here for 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.050
 like me please briefly again 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.450
 explain and what is mixed 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 martial arts and there used shock 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.200
 wrestling technique 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.300
 they prevail if you can ask so 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 and how mixed martial arts differ 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 from fighting without rules 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.520
 we have equipment and wrestling drums 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.530
 right Dmitry 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.079
 and the sport we have our distinguish so 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.140
 that it is universal 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.060
 that is, you must be able to own and that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.760
 other technique 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.290
 what is different from fighting but my without 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.050
 rules so that we have a very rule 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.600
 a lot of our species includes more than 60 species 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.710
 martial arts techniques 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.710
 so we don't have 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.110
 our view let's say so much softer than that 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.500
 the same thing itself was different 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.610
 soft mixed martial arts 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.830
 you recently talked about what 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.720
 support 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.430
 return to the norms is ready to you it seems 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 what does this help draw to the sport 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.200
 young people but what would any species 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.090
 martial arts you recommended young 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.330
 people to engage and parents who have 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.360
 boys are growing up I would of course 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.670
 advise parents 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 give your children to any sport 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:50.540
 Well, young people and young people to search 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.600
 himself to look then why have the ability 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 Well, the guy seems to me to own 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.649
 martial arts skills we have in my 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.899
 childhood on every guy went to fight 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.630
 or the boss that's just so many of them 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.170
 should be guided choice when parents i 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 the child chooses where to go i 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.549
 I think on the internal internal appeal to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 intuit will never fail this is true 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.970
 almost a year you hold the position 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.760
 president of the union of martial arts 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.030
 Russia, tell me what tasks you 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.030
 have to decide 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.519
 development of course our sport 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.110
 I have to travel a lot of the receiver 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:44.150
 meet with heads of regions 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:49.510
 plus we have accreditation now active 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.510
 and credit coaches and athletes judges 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.900
 much let's say so there were side 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.590
 organizations copying us this is not very 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.990
 good but it is very bad indeed 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.790
 sport is a popular sport 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.080
 popular many organizations appear 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.070
 public organizations that change 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.870
 one or two words and trying to say so 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.270
 use the same name for 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.430
 our halogen 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.370
 but here in my opinion I don't know but on 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.120
 my opinion is necessary intervention is necessary 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.370
 changes at the level of laws because 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.460
 really everyone who does not 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.460
 laziness 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.660
 plus goes let's say so now 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.640
 involving children in this view of my 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.380
 look all the same 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.530
 mixed martial arts 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.160
 can be engaged already with mature youth 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.440
 already mature athletes from how many years 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.270
 18 years old from 13 years old already having good 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.500
 physical training but not lower 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.570
 master of sports candidate 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.660
 why are you talking about the appearance 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.040
 these organizations are generally negative 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.120
 not a good level of those people 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.270
 who teach if you know the kind 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.270
 sports
