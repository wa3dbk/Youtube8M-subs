00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.240
 I have been asked to repeat the paradox of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.990
 the life 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.990
 and there goes 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.519
 they say that I believe the donkey and told him 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.940
 you will be a donkey 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.770
 you'll work from sunrise to sunset 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.440
 and it will charge on you the most what you 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.570
 put 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.150
 and you will live 35 years and the donkey answered sr 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.220
 I will be everything you ask but 35 years 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 much 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.660
 because the best 20 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.250
 and god created the donkey 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.960
 then I believe the dog and said you will be 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 dog you will take care of the house of men 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.880
 you will see what they give you and you will live 25 years 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.460
 the dog answered sr 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.050
 I will be everything you ask but 25 years 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 much 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 because the best 15 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.120
 and I believe the dog 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.350
 then he created the monkey and said he will be cute 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.320
 you will do antics to amuse the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.860
 the rest 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.060
 you will live 10 years 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 and the monkey pleased sir he in everything 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.840
 ask me but maybe I much 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.840
 because no better yes 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.250
 I believe the monkey finally created the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.070
 man and told him you'll be the most 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.200
 smart of the earth not to look towards 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.190
 the world will live 30 years 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.950
 and the man answered sir 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.810
 about everything I ask but 31 this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.610
 because it does not give me also the 15 that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.240
 rejected the donkey 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.130
 and the days that what the dog did 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.130
 and the five that do not accept the monkey 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 and I believe man 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.590
 and this is how man lives 30 years 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.900
 as men then he marries and lives 15 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.610
 years as a donkey working from sunrise to sunset 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.130
 and carrying on his back the weight of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.640
 the family 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 of new security 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.920
 and live 10 years as a dog 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.840
 looking at the house eating what they give and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.970
 ends up living five years as a monkey 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.739
 jumping from house to house of children and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.050
 doing antics to amuse the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.590
 grandchildren and this is the paradox of life 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.590
 and me 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.290
 and I wanted to tell her
