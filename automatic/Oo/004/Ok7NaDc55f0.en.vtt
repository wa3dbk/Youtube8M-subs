00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.330
 the current 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330
 be the first 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.720
 in general, europe 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.470
 the carnival of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.870
 the europe league 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 free 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.309
 after the meeting with the client 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.120
 and defining all bureaucratic issues the first step is 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 carefully analyze the products to be photographed 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.400
 this first product analysis 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.420
 tell us what techniques we should adopt 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 consequently what will be the equipment 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.920
 once you analyze the product we create a sketch 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.240
 very simple 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 this sketch gives us an overview of what a photo session will be 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.770
 In this first drawing we define the initial positions of all the lights at 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.280
 used 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.340
 we also define with the power and the type of light that would use 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.300
 as well as the types of diffusers needed 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.080
 in this particular case because it is a minute with some phases 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.250
 reflective 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.950
 we have to create a controlled environment 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.790
 preventing studio elements from being projected onto the product 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.750
 thinking that we wanted a panel that has dual purpose 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.540
 the first purpose is to create a limitation for the reflexes 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.910
 and as the camera was also positioned next monitor ' 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.880
 we created a barrier to it 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 leaving only a hole for milk 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.180
 other purpose of spain 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.429
 ted serve as a large softball is light diffuser 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.759
 and in this case the taller and longer panel is more pleasant it will be 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.479
 the final result 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.619
 In this sketch we also decide how the songs chosen will work 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.049
 luena - the finite background positioned the flashs cross-shaped 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.950
 left light hiromi in the right corner and in the right light 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.439
 I have to forget 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.100
 work this way 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.600
 we have a more homogeneous result because the whole background of the image 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.629
 so let's now go to the second exam 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.039
 define details as author of the desolation panel 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.229
 background size used 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.839
 and other measures 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.819
 are extremely important 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.729
 since through 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.849
 we want things to be the materials we are going to use 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.449
 as for example the footage of fabrics quantity of trotes among others 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.219
 remember if 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.019
 here the value is not the quality of messi 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 the quality of the information 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.039
 nothing 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.249
 ae 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.249
 the readjustments 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.269
 the main one of them said 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.519
 local 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.099
 each year 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.099
 in the next year 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.999
 I ended up playing two equipment the product that was not dead 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 He has a contract signed with the problem. 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.569
 braga sunday on the waterfront the first 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.569
 when the water level to drink 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.429
 according to the mec there is a very large demand 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.319
 Paulo 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.699
 the right to the prize as the place in the middle 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.759
 throughout the year with the equipment 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 he is not silly 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.129
 dr 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.129
 on camera 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.969
 Carolina 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.430
 was lacking 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.650
 I was 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.469
 epa 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.469
 to be canonized 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 nothing changed 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:36.770
 now
