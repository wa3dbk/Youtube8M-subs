am in Southern California this is purely
just<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.929> speed<00:00:10.170> test<00:00:10.910> not<00:00:11.910> based<00:00:12.120> on

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
just a speed test not based on

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.029 
just a speed test not based on
real-world<00:00:12.500> experience<00:00:15.710> Applegate<00:00:16.710> claim

real-world experience Applegate claim

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.060 
real-world experience Applegate claim
that<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.490> doubled<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> speed<00:00:19.010> compared<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that they doubled the speed compared to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
that they doubled the speed compared to
the<00:00:20.160> original<00:00:20.520> four<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> we're<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> test

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the original four so we're about to test

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:48.780 
the original four so we're about to test
it<00:00:22.859> out

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.570 

2.5<00:00:49.790> 204<00:00:51.760> 4's<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.060> is<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.710> 2.31<00:00:54.710> on<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.100> 4g

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
2.5 204 4's that is and 2.31 on the 4g

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.280 
2.5 204 4's that is and 2.31 on the 4g
that<00:00:55.790> inspire<00:00:56.270> 4G<00:00:58.540> but<00:00:59.540> upload<00:00:59.870> it's<00:01:00.020> much

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
that inspire 4G but upload it's much

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.230 
that inspire 4G but upload it's much
better<00:01:00.560> on<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.740> 4G<00:01:01.160> at<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.370> moment<00:01:04.240> reason

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
better on the 4G at the moment reason

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.510 
better on the 4G at the moment reason
being<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.660> there<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> lot<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.800> poor<00:01:06.980> s<00:01:07.160> owners

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
being is there is a lot of poor s owners

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.700 
being is there is a lot of poor s owners
and<00:01:07.730> most<00:01:08.120> likely<00:01:08.330> most<00:01:08.870> of<00:01:09.020> them<00:01:09.110> are<00:01:09.230> doing

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
and most likely most of them are doing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.560 
and most likely most of them are doing
speed<00:01:10.070> tests<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:10.910> like<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.180> am

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
speed tests just like I am

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.820 
speed tests just like I am
let's<00:01:12.760> run<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.910> test<00:01:14.060> one<00:01:14.240> more<00:01:14.360> time<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:17.830> would

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
let's run the test one more time I would

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.290 
let's run the test one more time I would
like<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.100> run<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.340> test<00:01:19.550> three<00:01:19.790> times<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.210> get

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
like to run the test three times and get

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.810 
like to run the test three times and get
an<00:01:20.390> average<00:01:20.570> from<00:01:20.900> there

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:42.120 

see<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.630> break<00:01:27.840> three<00:01:28.520> No

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.080 

yeah<00:01:42.730> upload<00:01:43.210> its<00:01:43.560> heavily<00:01:44.560> hammer<00:01:45.090> I'm

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
yeah upload its heavily hammer I'm

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.280 
yeah upload its heavily hammer I'm
assuming<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:46.750> from<00:01:47.140> other<00:01:47.350> forest<00:01:47.830> owners<00:01:48.010> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
assuming it's from other forest owners a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.380 
assuming it's from other forest owners a
my<00:01:50.290> phone<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.190> would<00:01:51.760> at<00:01:51.970> least<00:01:52.120> get

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
my phone for that I would at least get

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.190 
my phone for that I would at least get
one<00:01:52.740> megabyte<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:55.330> let's<00:01:55.720> run<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> test

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
one megabyte up and let's run the test

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.830 
one megabyte up and let's run the test
one<00:01:56.410> more<00:01:56.590> time<00:01:56.770> say<00:01:57.100> we<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.369> break<00:01:57.580> three<00:01:57.940> on

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
one more time say we can break three on

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:20.540 
one more time say we can break three on
any<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.170> these

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030 

and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.240> inspired<00:02:21.960> for<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.410> showing<00:02:22.590> four

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and then inspired for just showing four

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.660 
and then inspired for just showing four
parts<00:02:23.490> only<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.140> iPhone<00:02:25.710> 4s<00:02:25.890> only<00:02:26.400> getting

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
parts only on the iPhone 4s only getting

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.190 
parts only on the iPhone 4s only getting
two<00:02:26.820> bars<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.870> strange

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
two bars that that is strange

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.370 
two bars that that is strange
considering<00:02:28.830> they're<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> same<00:02:29.310> network<00:02:30.380> and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
considering they're the same network and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.900 
considering they're the same network and
considering<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.890> Apple<00:02:32.280> did<00:02:32.430> boast<00:02:32.700> about

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
considering that Apple did boast about

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.120 
considering that Apple did boast about
their<00:02:33.240> new<00:02:33.690> antenna<00:02:34.020> system<00:02:35.390> yep<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.130> that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
their new antenna system yep and that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.300 
their new antenna system yep and that
was<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> quick<00:02:38.580> speed<00:02:39.060> test
