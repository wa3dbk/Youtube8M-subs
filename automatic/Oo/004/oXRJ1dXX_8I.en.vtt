00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.900
 this good afternoon friends and youtube them 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.690
 I come to show a tutorial of how 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.969
 this install applies if I'm not sorry 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 The official themes of this wine are 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.699
 launcher are official themes of delhi and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 keyboards and stuff for the guide 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.009
 70 or for any other device the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 and we are only going to occupy two applications 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:34.020
 what would these two be and have our 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 phone surrounded the smart work that is the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.720
 official store of him and that I do not know if the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 I think it's not ruth not to occupy the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
 application but how is it hidden 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 we have to find it with access 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.470
 root but if you do not want to root your 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.310
 phone can download it from troops of 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.950
 On the other hand, I'm not sure what 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.710
 be on the other side but the same here is 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 better as well as I tell them so that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.320
 is driving then we enter 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.320
 explorer router 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.189
 let's be here true by default the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.950
 root explorer this we are going to enter 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.760
 the system folder and then the folder 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.550
 of apps lo q poptún 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.670
 and here is the leaf smart worth once 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.760
 that they have it installed is going to tell them 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.220
 what 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.260
 if you want to update you are going to put 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.770
 that if I 'm not going to install it anymore 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.720
 I have it updated and it does not weigh much 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.280
 the update but then for 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.260
 save me in the update that have 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.120
 installed for you install it and what 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.850
 update once you're already 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.850
 updated we go to the application 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.060
 how to see then it's like a pastor has the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.650
 image of a projector 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.670
 they have to make an account 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.070
 It is very fast with very few steps 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.530
 so here we are going here to improve 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.750
 as you see in many things you can explore 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.030
 but for reasons of time I do it 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 fast better start topic this then I 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.460
 I have in this elqui moment the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.080
 normal but I have already downloaded this one 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.230
 but the truth has long since called me 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 To him he caught my attention button is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.940
 look is colorful as you can see here 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.740
 is 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.100
 then what we are going to do to download 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.380
 they weigh nothing 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.870
 also if you want later I will do 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.170
 a video of how to change the keyboard as 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.080
 come I do not have the factory anymore this is 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.680
 another one has the same 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.560
 functions the faces and things like that but 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.080
 I liked more the appearance of this edita 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.620
 is installed then once what 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.360
 let's say centered we go back to the beginning this 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.890
 is the original theme of and that comes 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.650
 defect we start this phone the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.420
 We really liked it a lot, it's very fluid 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.880
 settings 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.920
 and then we're going to be here I do not know 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.270
 how do you have it and so it is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.670
 Well the joke is that you should 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.670
 look at the screen and where they find 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 this is going to enter the screen 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.510
 principal 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.239
 this select start theme if 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.659
 I have some boat I demand the truth 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.370
 liked more the normal or theme the axis and here 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.590
 are the three cones downloaded as they 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.390
 I said wood see and the devotee must be 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.939
 they just downloaded then we 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.450
 we simply go on the devotee and what 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.450
 we can apply 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.090
 and it is already the subject then applied 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.090
 let's go back to the beginning 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:53.370
 to see how our theme was 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.370
 and here's our new theme yí 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.590
 I really like them a lot, they are very 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.230
 fluids I think it's more fluid than up 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.030
 the original and that at this time 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.860
 I'm recording and as you can see I have 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.860
 several open applications 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.660
 and here is this is a new subject of him 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.690
 and they are official subjects of him 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.930
 they were not granted a prehistory and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.210
 thank you for you are here I can 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.770
 saying a like would be great since the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.220
 it really covers me a lot looking for this 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.430
 application so thank you and until the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.430
