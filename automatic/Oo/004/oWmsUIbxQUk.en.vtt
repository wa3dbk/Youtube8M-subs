blender tutorial this one will be on

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.040 
blender tutorial this one will be on
rendering<00:00:07.440> animations<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.400> blender<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.960> you

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
rendering animations in blender now you

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720 
rendering animations in blender now you
might<00:00:10.230> think<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.769> know<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.280> render<00:00:11.550> an

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
might think I know how to render an

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
might think I know how to render an
animation<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.360> blender<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:13.200> just<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.530> over

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
animation in blender you just go over

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.799 
animation in blender you just go over
here<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:14.190> your<00:00:14.370> vendor<00:00:14.610> settings<00:00:14.969> set<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
here into your vendor settings set it to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
here into your vendor settings set it to
QuickTime<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.500> click<00:00:17.070> render<00:00:17.460> animation

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
QuickTime and click render animation

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.130 
QuickTime and click render animation
simple<00:00:18.960> as<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.199> well<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.640> works<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.810> is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
simple as that well that works but it is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.599 
simple as that well that works but it is
by<00:00:22.470> far<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.580> best<00:00:24.060> method<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.609> so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
by far not the best method to use so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
by far not the best method to use so
this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> had<00:00:27.750> thought<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
this is what I had thought for the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.690 
this is what I had thought for the
longest<00:00:28.740> time<00:00:28.859> early<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.970> my<00:00:30.420> blender

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
longest time early on in my blender

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
longest time early on in my blender
endeavors<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> issue<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
endeavors and the issue with this is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.170 
endeavors and the issue with this is
you're<00:00:37.140> rendering<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.590> longer<00:00:38.010> animation<00:00:38.790> with

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you're rendering a longer animation with

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
you're rendering a longer animation with
higher<00:00:39.930> quality<00:00:40.200> samples<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.100> something<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
higher quality samples or something is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
higher quality samples or something is
taken<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.149> 10<00:00:42.510> minutes<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> frame<00:00:43.110> or

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
taken you know 10 minutes to frame or

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.580 
taken you know 10 minutes to frame or
something<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:44.340> gets<00:00:44.640> halfway<00:00:44.969> done<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
something it gets halfway done and you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
something it gets halfway done and you
have<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.250> crash<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:49.020> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
have a crash or you want to use your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
have a crash or you want to use your
computer<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.710> something<00:00:49.980> else<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.309> it's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
computer for something else because it's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
computer for something else because it's
moving<00:00:50.789> slow<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.899> can't<00:00:52.170> stop<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.739> once

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
moving slow and you can't stop it once

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.630 
moving slow and you can't stop it once
it's<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> far<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.660> biggest

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
it's that far and that is the biggest

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's that far and that is the biggest
difficulty<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.090> setting<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.410> today

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
difficulty with this setting so today

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
difficulty with this setting so today
I'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> show<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.030> proper<00:01:00.660> way<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
I'm going to show you the proper way of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
I'm going to show you the proper way of
rendering<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.649> animations<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.399> after<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
rendering out animations and after I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
rendering out animations and after I
figured<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.589> such<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.189> light

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
figured this out it was such a light

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.020 
figured this out it was such a light
lifesaver<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> way<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.430> render<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.880> an

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
lifesaver so the way you render out an

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.740 
lifesaver so the way you render out an
animation<00:01:09.330> properly<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
animation properly is you do not use a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
animation properly is you do not use a
movie<00:01:13.080> file<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.070> we're<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:14.520> image

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
movie file but we're going to use image

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
movie file but we're going to use image
files<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> render<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.430> image

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
files and render them out as an image

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.350 
files and render them out as an image
sequence<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.720> within<00:01:19.200> blender<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.850> instead

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sequence all within blender so instead

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850 
sequence all within blender so instead
of<00:01:21.420> choosing<00:01:21.659> QuickTime<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of choosing QuickTime I'm just going to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.609 
of choosing QuickTime I'm just going to
choose<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.880> jpg<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.110> any<00:01:25.320> sort<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
choose say jpg you can do any sort of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.109 
choose say jpg you can do any sort of
image<00:01:25.890> file<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.700> doing<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> really

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
image file and if you're doing a really

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
image file and if you're doing a really
high<00:01:27.270> quality<00:01:27.330> video<00:01:27.990> you'll<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> choose

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
high quality video you'll want to choose

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.219 
high quality video you'll want to choose
a<00:01:28.880> higher<00:01:29.880> quality<00:01:30.360> file<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> open<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
a higher quality file I can open you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
a higher quality file I can open you
extra<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.590> something<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> I'm

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
extra or something like that but I'm

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
extra or something like that but I'm
just<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> choose<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.930> JPEG<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.710> now

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
just going to choose a JPEG for now

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
just going to choose a JPEG for now
because<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.700> example<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> I'm

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

I'm<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> choose<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> file<00:01:52.500> here

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
I'm just going to choose a file here

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.670 
I'm just going to choose a file here
where<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> output<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:54.180> images<00:01:54.899> so

where I want to output my images so
basically<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> set<00:01:57.030> let<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
basically if you have it set let it just

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.889 
basically if you have it set let it just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
just going to click render animation and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.729 
just going to click render animation and
it<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:41.010> render<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.489> each<00:02:42.209> frame<00:02:42.630> save<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739

and render out the next one so this is
the<00:02:48.150> proper<00:02:48.510> way<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.930> render<00:02:49.320> out<00:02:49.440> an

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the proper way to render out an

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.370 
the proper way to render out an
animation<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.510> let<00:02:51.510> me<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:51.750> quick<00:02:51.959> time

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
animation and let me just quick time

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.610 
animation and let me just quick time
lapse<00:02:52.410> through<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.640> until<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.720> rendering

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
lapse through this until the rendering

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.320 
lapse through this until the rendering
of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> animation<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.489> frames<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.940> done<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
of the animation and frames is done and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:07.200 
of the animation and frames is done and
then<00:02:57.840> I'll<00:02:57.989> pick<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.250> next<00:02:59.430> step

would be if we rendered it out through

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.670 
would be if we rendered it out through
QuickTime<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:10.209> now<00:04:10.359> if<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.989> play<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.530> can

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
QuickTime but now if I play it you can

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.110 
QuickTime but now if I play it you can
see<00:04:11.829> it's<00:04:12.129> playing<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.609> little<00:04:12.699> bit<00:04:12.879> slow

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
see it's playing a little bit slow

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.199 
see it's playing a little bit slow
because<00:04:13.359> it's<00:04:13.659> basically<00:04:13.989> cashing<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.889> in

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
because it's basically cashing it in

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.029 
because it's basically cashing it in
but<00:04:16.209> there<00:04:16.780> we<00:04:16.870> go<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.259> is<00:04:17.289> our<00:04:17.680> animation

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
but there we go that is our animation

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.729 
but there we go that is our animation
and<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:19.359> if<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.780> want<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.019> save<00:04:20.199> this<00:04:20.500> out

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
and now if you want to save this out

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.890 
and now if you want to save this out
there<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.579> go<00:04:21.639> there's<00:04:22.389> still<00:04:22.659> playing<00:04:22.870> a

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
there you go there's still playing a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.149 
there you go there's still playing a
little<00:04:23.050> bit<00:04:23.139> slow<00:04:23.349> but<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.860> recording

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
little bit slow but I'm not recording

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.779 
little bit slow but I'm not recording
right<00:04:24.430> now<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.750> I'm<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.990> pause<00:04:26.139> this<00:04:26.349> now

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
right now so I'm going to pause this now

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.189 
right now so I'm going to pause this now
if<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:27.880> want<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.150> say<00:04:28.270> about<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.570> animation

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
if you want to say about this animation

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.370 
if you want to say about this animation
well<00:04:29.800> what<00:04:29.979> we<00:04:30.070> do<00:04:30.220> now<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.699> go<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.060> default<00:04:31.449> we

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
well what we do now is go to default we

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.670 
well what we do now is go to default we
can<00:04:32.409> now<00:04:32.740> change<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.280> from<00:04:33.520> JPEG<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.210> QuickTime

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
can now change it from JPEG to QuickTime

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.010 
can now change it from JPEG to QuickTime
because<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.919> is<00:04:36.099> in<00:04:36.280> our<00:04:36.580> timeline<00:04:37.389> here<00:04:37.870> if

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
because this is in our timeline here if

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.129 
because this is in our timeline here if
we<00:04:38.919> go<00:04:39.070> back<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.280> let<00:04:40.090> me<00:04:40.180> go<00:04:40.330> here<00:04:40.659> if<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:40.990> bunch

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
we go back to let me go here if a bunch

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.249 
we go back to let me go here if a bunch
of<00:04:41.259> defaults<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.430> scrub<00:04:42.789> down<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.780> where

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
of defaults and you scrub down to where

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.050 
of defaults and you scrub down to where
is<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.680> post-processing<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.669> can<00:04:45.789> see<00:04:45.970> we

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
is it post-processing you can see we

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.930 
is it post-processing you can see we
have<00:04:46.210> compositing<00:04:46.930> here<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.729> sequencer<00:04:48.729> here

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
have compositing here and sequencer here

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.930 
have compositing here and sequencer here
and<00:04:49.449> this<00:04:49.599> is<00:04:49.750> processor<00:04:50.289> render<00:04:50.590> if<00:04:50.940> there's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
and this is processor render if there's

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.279 
and this is processor render if there's
something<00:04:52.240> in<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.360> video<00:04:52.570> sequencer<00:04:53.110> so

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
something in the video sequencer so

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.540 
something in the video sequencer so
basically<00:04:53.620> if<00:04:53.860> there's<00:04:54.039> anything<00:04:54.250> in<00:04:54.460> the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
basically if there's anything in the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.120 
basically if there's anything in the
video<00:04:54.880> sequence<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.479> editor<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.770> will<00:04:56.979> be

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
video sequence and editor this will be

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.890 
video sequence and editor this will be
what's<00:04:57.610> rendered<00:04:58.000> because<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.479> is<00:04:58.630> checked

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
what's rendered because this is checked

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.749 
what's rendered because this is checked
here<00:04:59.110> so<00:05:00.009> I'm<00:05:00.159> going<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.430> change<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.729> to

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
here so I'm going to change it to

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.870 
here so I'm going to change it to
QuickTime<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.500> let's<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.680> put<00:05:02.889> this<00:05:03.070> not<00:05:03.759> in

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
QuickTime and let's just put this not in

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.730 
QuickTime and let's just put this not in
our<00:05:04.000> frames<00:05:04.270> folder<00:05:04.659> but<00:05:04.840> right<00:05:04.990> there<00:05:05.229> that's

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
our frames folder but right there that's

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.070 
our frames folder but right there that's
good<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.280> now<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.509> just<00:05:07.659> click<00:05:07.780> render

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
good and now I can just click render

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080 
good and now I can just click render
animation<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.949> it<00:05:09.070> will<00:05:09.159> render<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.490> out<00:05:09.639> very

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
animation and it will render it out very

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.990 
animation and it will render it out very
quickly<00:05:10.560> saving<00:05:11.560> out<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.889> QuickTime<00:05:12.400> thing

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
quickly saving out the QuickTime thing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.020 
quickly saving out the QuickTime thing
by<00:05:13.360> putting<00:05:13.630> all<00:05:13.900> those<00:05:14.080> frames<00:05:14.500> together<00:05:15.280> so

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
by putting all those frames together so

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.860 
by putting all those frames together so
you<00:05:16.090> don't<00:05:16.120> have<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.389> worry<00:05:16.539> about<00:05:16.659> like

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
you don't have to worry about like

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.540 
you don't have to worry about like
render<00:05:17.199> time<00:05:17.409> as<00:05:17.560> being<00:05:17.770> really<00:05:18.009> long<00:05:18.310> because

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
render time as being really long because

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.490 
render time as being really long because
the<00:05:18.849> second<00:05:19.210> time<00:05:19.360> rendering<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.960> after<00:05:20.380> it's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
the second time rendering it after it's

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.230 
the second time rendering it after it's
in<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.680> video<00:05:20.979> sequence<00:05:21.219> editor<00:05:21.639> is<00:05:21.849> very

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
in the video sequence editor is very

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.480 
in the video sequence editor is very
fast<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.349> just<00:05:23.500> flies<00:05:23.710> through<00:05:24.099> it

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
fast and it just flies through it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.420 
fast and it just flies through it
frames<00:05:24.940> together<00:05:25.660> now<00:05:26.319> few<00:05:26.979> things<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.310> keep

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
frames together now few things to keep

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.010 
frames together now few things to keep
in<00:05:27.580> mind<00:05:27.610> is<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.419> want<00:05:28.569> to<00:05:28.630> make<00:05:28.720> sure<00:05:28.750> your

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
in mind is you want to make sure your

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.450 
in mind is you want to make sure your
frame<00:05:29.259> rate<00:05:29.319> is<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.580> exact<00:05:31.000> same<00:05:31.270> on<00:05:31.539> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
frame rate is the exact same on the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.700 
frame rate is the exact same on the
techno<00:05:33.460> timeline<00:05:34.000> as<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.599> was<00:05:34.810> when<00:05:35.319> you<00:05:35.349> saved

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
techno timeline as it was when you saved

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.620 
techno timeline as it was when you saved
out<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.009> frames<00:05:36.250> so<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:36.880> don't<00:05:37.060> change<00:05:37.389> this

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
out the frames so like don't change this

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.990 
out the frames so like don't change this
between<00:05:38.099> when<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.190> render<00:05:39.460> out<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.759> frames

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
between when you render out the frames

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.480 
between when you render out the frames
when<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.360> render<00:05:40.539> out<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.840> movie<00:05:41.199> but<00:05:41.560> there

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
when you render out the movie but there

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.510 
when you render out the movie but there
we<00:05:42.580> go<00:05:42.729> same<00:05:43.120> with<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.360> resolution<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.740> now

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
we go same with the resolution so now

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.189 
we go same with the resolution so now
let<00:05:45.669> me<00:05:45.699> go<00:05:45.880> check<00:05:46.240> out<00:05:46.479> my<00:05:47.020> video<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:49.630> here's

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
let me go check out my video so here's

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.860 
let me go check out my video so here's
my<00:05:50.440> folder<00:05:51.069> here's<00:05:51.639> my<00:05:51.849> frames<00:05:52.240> folder<00:05:52.720> with

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
my folder here's my frames folder with

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.839 
my folder here's my frames folder with
all<00:05:52.990> my<00:05:53.080> images<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.680> it<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:54.130> here's<00:05:54.699> my
