00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a second the second thing is my father

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.800 
a second the second thing is my father
had<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.530> birch<00:01:28.830> pollen<00:01:29.039> he<00:01:29.310> burned<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.600> asked

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
had a birch pollen he burned and asked

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.710 
had a birch pollen he burned and asked
if<00:01:31.050> i<00:01:31.229> would<00:01:31.289> like<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> ashes<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.970> garden

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
if i would like to ashes for my garden

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.460 
if i would like to ashes for my garden
horse<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.740> wood<00:01:34.920> ashes<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> natural<00:01:36.810> source

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
horse of wood ashes are a natural source

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
horse of wood ashes are a natural source
of<00:01:37.740> potassium<00:01:38.479> third<00:01:39.479> ingredient<00:01:39.659> at

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
of potassium third ingredient at

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
of potassium third ingredient at
fertilizer<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.250> i<00:01:41.280> thought<00:01:41.429> yeah<00:01:41.610> that'd<00:01:41.850> be

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fertilizer so i thought yeah that'd be

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.660 
fertilizer so i thought yeah that'd be
great<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.929> that<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> my<00:01:43.350> garden<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.550> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
great put that in my garden and what it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
great put that in my garden and what it
didn't<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.569> about<00:01:45.810> until<00:01:46.050> later<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
didn't think about until later is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
didn't think about until later is
actually<00:01:47.789> wood<00:01:48.060> ashes<00:01:48.380> typically<00:01:49.380> or

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
actually wood ashes typically or

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.990 
actually wood ashes typically or
alkaline<00:01:50.429> so<00:01:51.090> i<00:01:51.119> probably<00:01:51.450> raise<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:53.000> soul

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
alkaline so i probably raise the soul

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
alkaline so i probably raise the soul
levels<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.810> acidity<00:01:55.259> level<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.829> lower

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
levels in that acidity level or lower

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
levels in that acidity level or lower
the<00:01:56.310> city<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> level<00:01:57.090> raise<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.899> alkaline

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the city to level raise an alkaline

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.190 
the city to level raise an alkaline
level<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.250> too<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.930> most<00:02:00.930> garden

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
level a little too much most garden

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
level a little too much most garden
vegetables<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> could<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> sole<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
vegetables like you could be the sole to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.620 
vegetables like you could be the sole to
be<00:02:02.909> slightly<00:02:03.149> acid<00:02:03.570> maybe<00:02:05.090> six<00:02:06.090> six<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.539> a

be slightly acid maybe six six and a
half<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.079> seven<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.100> range<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.880> i

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
half to seven that kind of range so i

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
half to seven that kind of range so i
may<00:02:09.329> raise<00:02:10.320> my<00:02:10.619> growing<00:02:11.190> soul<00:02:12.140> acidity<00:02:13.140> level

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
may raise my growing soul acidity level

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
may raise my growing soul acidity level
or<00:02:13.560> alkaline<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> level<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.790> too<00:02:14.940> high
