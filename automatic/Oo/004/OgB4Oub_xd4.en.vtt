War<00:00:08.330> one<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.559> way<00:00:09.680> we've<00:00:10.040> done<00:00:10.190> that<00:00:10.370> is

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
War one and the way we've done that is

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.730 
War one and the way we've done that is
we've<00:00:10.700> actually<00:00:10.850> put<00:00:11.150> a<00:00:11.180> trench<00:00:11.620> into<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
we've actually put a trench into the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.170 
we've actually put a trench into the
middle<00:00:13.010> of<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:13.219> garden<00:00:13.610> to<00:00:13.639> start<00:00:14.029> to

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
middle of the garden to start to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.750 
middle of the garden to start to
actually<00:00:14.330> set<00:00:14.779> the<00:00:14.809> scene<00:00:15.309> and<00:00:16.309> that<00:00:16.490> trench

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
actually set the scene and that trench

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.630 
actually set the scene and that trench
represents<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.810> realistic<00:00:18.410> trench<00:00:18.740> from<00:00:19.310> World

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
represents a realistic trench from World

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120 
represents a realistic trench from World
War<00:00:19.670> one<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.240> then<00:00:20.900> running<00:00:21.200> off<00:00:21.410> thus<00:00:21.680> at<00:00:21.920> the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
War one and then running off thus at the

side of the trench and around the trench

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.609 
side of the trench and around the trench
we<00:00:25.130> have<00:00:25.280> representations<00:00:26.240> from<00:00:26.619> various

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
we have representations from various

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.430 
we have representations from various
parts<00:00:28.100> of<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.340> war<00:00:28.580> effort<00:00:29.240> in<00:00:29.930> terms<00:00:30.230> of

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
parts of the war effort in terms of

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.600 
parts of the war effort in terms of
industry<00:00:31.010> for<00:00:31.250> example<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:33.590> Acme<00:00:34.160> Hudson

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
industry for example the the Acme Hudson

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.149 
industry for example the the Acme Hudson
whistles<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:35.989> were<00:00:36.170> actually<00:00:36.620> made<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:37.069> the

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:37.159 
whistles that were actually made to the

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.590 
whistles that were actually made to the
Troops<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.550> go<00:00:37.640> over<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.969> top<00:00:38.149> of<00:00:38.179> the<00:00:38.359> trench

Troops to go over the top of the trench

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500 
Troops to go over the top of the trench
and<00:00:39.199> we've<00:00:39.920> also<00:00:40.100> got<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.609> BSA<00:00:41.030> folding

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
and we've also got the BSA folding

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.709 
and we've also got the BSA folding
bicycle<00:00:42.109> or<00:00:43.010> that<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:44.089> troops<00:00:44.479> that<00:00:44.600> was

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
bicycle or that the troops that was

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.630 
bicycle or that the troops that was
actually<00:00:44.989> issued<00:00:45.079> on<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.440> ground<00:00:45.679> as<00:00:46.249> well<00:00:46.519> as

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
actually issued on the ground as well as

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.939 
actually issued on the ground as well as
some<00:00:46.819> of<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:46.999> shells<00:00:47.300> also<00:00:48.050> made<00:00:48.260> by<00:00:48.440> Hudson's

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
some of the shells also made by Hudson's

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.309 
some of the shells also made by Hudson's
which<00:00:49.370> were<00:00:49.519> expended<00:00:50.120> during<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.899> Poynting

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
which were expended during the Poynting

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.439 
which were expended during the Poynting
what<00:00:51.979> we've<00:00:52.159> tried<00:00:52.339> to<00:00:52.370> do<00:00:52.609> here<00:00:52.909> is<00:00:53.120> is

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
what we've tried to do here is is

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.610 
what we've tried to do here is is
replicate<00:00:54.139> a<00:00:54.379> World<00:00:54.769> War<00:00:54.949> One<00:00:55.249> trench<00:00:55.609> and<00:00:56.620> you

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
replicate a World War One trench and you

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.049 
replicate a World War One trench and you
can<00:00:58.039> see<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.370> we've<00:00:58.489> set<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.269> scene<00:01:00.010> by

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
can see that we've set the scene by

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.669 
can see that we've set the scene by
Brooks's<00:01:02.059> poem<00:01:02.389> the<00:01:02.510> soldier<00:01:02.959> red<00:01:03.469> viburnum

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
Brooks's poem the soldier red viburnum

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.259 
Brooks's poem the soldier red viburnum
Cribbins<00:01:04.339> which<00:01:04.519> actually<00:01:04.820> sets<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.120> scene

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
Cribbins which actually sets the scene

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.320 
Cribbins which actually sets the scene
very<00:01:05.420> nicely<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:07.909> we<00:01:08.030> tried<00:01:08.299> to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
very nicely and then we tried to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.459 
very nicely and then we tried to
indicate<00:01:09.280> various<00:01:10.280> fits<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.659> trench<00:01:12.049> life

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
indicate various fits of the trench life

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.560 
indicate various fits of the trench life
with<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.250> periscopes<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.090> actually<00:01:14.420> would

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
with the periscopes that actually would

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.560 
with the periscopes that actually would
look<00:01:14.719> out<00:01:14.899> over<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.590> point<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:16.039> safety<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.270> step

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
look out over a point of safety the step

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.450 
look out over a point of safety the step
platform<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.320> firing<00:01:18.710> platform<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.369> would

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
platform the firing platform that would

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.069 
platform the firing platform that would
allow<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.759> soldiers<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.420> step<00:01:20.659> up<00:01:20.840> and

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
allow the soldiers to step up and

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.889 
allow the soldiers to step up and
actually<00:01:21.560> fire<00:01:21.920> out<00:01:22.159> at<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.399> top<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.750> we've

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
actually fire out at the top and we've

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.010 
actually fire out at the top and we've
also<00:01:24.079> put<00:01:24.560> small<00:01:24.979> elements<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:26.030> their<00:01:26.780> life

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
also put small elements of their life

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.649 
also put small elements of their life
that<00:01:27.320> was<00:01:27.469> indicative<00:01:27.799> at<00:01:28.219> the<00:01:28.340> time<00:01:28.659> which

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
that was indicative at the time which

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.219 
that was indicative at the time which
also<00:01:30.039> includes<00:01:31.039> some<00:01:31.340> very<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:32.180> basic<00:01:32.600> food

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
also includes some very very basic food

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.340 
also includes some very very basic food
groups<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.520> we've<00:01:35.509> obviously<00:01:35.929> tried<00:01:36.200> to

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
groups and we've obviously tried to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.730 
groups and we've obviously tried to
replicate<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:38.299> rats<00:01:38.570> be<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.049> in<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.289> comical

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
replicate the rats be it in a comical

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.910 
replicate the rats be it in a comical
version<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.390> obviously<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.929> trenches<00:01:42.710> were

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
version but obviously the trenches were

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
version but obviously the trenches were
full<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.429> them

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 

and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.500> got<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:52.649> carrier<00:01:53.399> pigeons

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and then we got some carrier pigeons

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.160 
and then we got some carrier pigeons
we're<00:01:54.000> obviously<00:01:54.149> obviously<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.930> were

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
we're obviously obviously which were

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
we're obviously obviously which were
used<00:01:55.530> extensively<00:01:55.890> during<00:01:56.700> World<00:01:57.030> War<00:01:57.060> 1<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
used extensively during World War 1 to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410 
used extensively during World War 1 to
actually<00:01:57.750> passing<00:01:58.170> messages<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.399> point<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
actually passing messages from point to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.730 
actually passing messages from point to
point<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.350> too<00:02:01.500> dangerous

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
point because it was just too dangerous

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580 
point because it was just too dangerous
to<00:02:02.189> actually<00:02:02.490> take<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> troops<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to actually take the troops out of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
to actually take the troops out of the
trenches<00:02:05.039> because<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.430> didn't<00:02:05.729> actually

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
trenches because they didn't actually

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.550 
trenches because they didn't actually
move<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.570> far<00:02:06.840> without<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.439> getting

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
move that far without actually getting

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.059 
move that far without actually getting
shot<00:02:08.780> how<00:02:09.780> long<00:02:09.959> did<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.170> take<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.530> build<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
shot how long did it take to build and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.460 
shot how long did it take to build and
the<00:02:11.730> original<00:02:12.150> bill<00:02:12.330> took<00:02:12.599> ten<00:02:12.900> solid<00:02:13.110> days

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the original bill took ten solid days
