00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 It seems a lie that time passes so 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 fast but on January 11, 2015 it 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.910
 met exactly 10 years 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.910
 release of resident evil 4 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.080
 and for a video game that so much for good 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.900
 as for evil had a great impact both 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.119
 in the survival horror genre as in 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.860
 the industry in general created by 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.869
 shinji mikami father of the saga who 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.660
 recently tried to return to the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.700
 roots of the genre with diebel within was 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.710
 generally acclaimed in all its 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.230
 aspects in his day although now many 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.120
 they accuse him of being the one who meant the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 beginning of the end of the horror genre 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 although he resides live he was not the pioneer 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.420
 in this style of game yes that knew 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.190
 perfect the formula to a level 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.320
 that even today it's difficult to improve 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.539
 beyond the purely playable aspect 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.539
 during the last decade this saga was 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.609
 synonymous with these narrow corridors 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.590
 very limited ammunition cryptic puzzles 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.440
 and fixed cameras that put your hair 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.260
 this vanished to a great extent 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 in resident evil 4 wrongly there 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.740
 people who take this fourth installment 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.290
 numbered as the first made in three 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.850
 dimensions when that is not so in the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.890
 year 2000 the glorious sega dreamcast 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.650
 he enjoyed resident evil code veronica 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 that even keeping the angles fixed or 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.260
 semifixes of the saga 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.780
 It offered a whole world made 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.930
 completely with shape polygons 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.430
 100% three-dimensional we will not go into 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.259
 concrete details to avoid the greatest 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.330
 Pillage number is possible but also 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.610
 of relatively open location 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.229
 what really changed the rules of the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.899
 game was the free targeted 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 completely manual not yet not you 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.710
 allowed to walk and shoot at the same 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.020
 time but the change of perspective 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.479
 It also forced a change in style 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 where the pure and hard action charges a lot 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.799
 more importance the ammunition happened to be 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.479
 a scarce commodity to something quite common 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.310
 although not exaggerated and is that the increase 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.740
 huge sections purely from 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.240
 This was required by the type of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.100
 enemy characters and stories are 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.690
 completely modified the puzzles were 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.700
 they saw diminished to the minimum expression 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.429
 both at the level of difficulty and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.200
 amount and of course the count in 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.289
 part of the story with a companion 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.569
 he forced us all to take our side 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.569
 more perverted more than once 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 no no no no no do not tell me you do not 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.590
 you did not I do not believe you the restrictive and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.050
 original save system was seen 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 pretty smoothed keeps saving 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.680
 the famous typewriters that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.870
 they were in fixed places but in this 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.030
 case it was no longer necessary to use tapes 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.640
 for it therefore you could save your 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.260
 advance as many times as you would like this 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.050
 it was one of the most criticized aspects 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.940
 without a doubt I do not think that 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.250
 it would have cost a lot to include it at least 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.500
 optionally but in addition to changing 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 how certain elements worked 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
 introduced other unpublished in the saga 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.890
 the unforgettable flying kicks that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.160
 many times they worked when they want 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.160
 for example 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.210
 come on because pussy do not kick me 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.210
 if the guy was stunned, not what 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.640
 I also understand unnecessarily 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.560
 dramatic jumps through windows or fences 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.390
 that gave the truth an interesting 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.850
 freedom when trying to escape or 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.010
 explore some collectibles and clear 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.000
 is our dear seller and his 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.000
 very famous 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.090
 and purchases of weapons improvements of the same 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.659
 acquisition of consumables sale of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.730
 objects 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.340
 the merchant opened a large fan 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.349
 of possibilities until we had these 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.389
 loved and hated in equal parts quick 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.249
 time events to give some life to 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.639
 the most cinematic moments of the 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.639
 adventure 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.800
 equal resident 4 was developed in 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.140
 a people of Spain what throws us 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.300
 two disturbing questions that never 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.950
 they were answered by first capon 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.310
 because you think Spain is in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.310
 America 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.300
 what happened 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.400
 and second that would take the good of 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.020
 leon s kennedy to do this that does 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.699
 at the beginning of the adventure 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.699
 It is my being 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.340
 it's good 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.289
 What the hell are you doing here? 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.860
 dumbass 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.409
 I'm beautiful 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.990
 good luck friend trying to make a 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.729
 Spanish peasant understands you something in 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.030
 English if at least it had been for 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.879
 example in a city or not does not matter 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.590
 forgetting with permission of some games 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.780
 of xbox like ninja gaiden or splinter 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.819
 cell chaos theory resident tivo el 4 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.830
 for gamecube it was the technical top of 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.740
 generation and although at first 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.789
 it was exclusive to the nintendo console 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.759
 subsequently it was launched on playstation 2 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:18.330
 and more recently on pc nintendo wii 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.669
 xbox 360 playstation3 and devices 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.860
 mobile phones with different improvements and additions 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.620
 but it is that even in the year 2014 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.840
 came back to release a new edition on pc 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.430
 the second of the platform offering 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.650
 this time 1080p and 60 images per second 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.229
 yes the famous resident tivo the 4 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.060
 that we all know was not always like that and 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.129
 is that a leak of some videos of 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.469
 an early version of the game we 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.810
 they taught something different very different from 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.120
 what we saw later in stores and 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.439
 call me classic if you want but every 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.569
 Once I see it, it makes me want to cry 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.119
 seeing what we missed 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:58.939
 this was resident and boal 4 also 

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:58.939
 known as a resident on 3.5 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.080
 all right 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.330
 as you see mix elements of the version 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.639
 definitive with a lot of atmosphere 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.010
 more classic an example of that not much 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.570
 less had to pull the roots of 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.570
 the saga to give it a breath of air 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.180
 cool but this game does not exist reside 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.130
 tivo the 4 is this many times is 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.410
 considered one of the best 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.389
 games ever made and at the same time one of 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.880
 the worst reside tivoli is that maybe 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.650
 the name is the biggest of his problems 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.330
 I would like to ask those who 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.250
 you played well either in your day or more 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.620
 recently what do you think of what 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.270
 means this resident or the 4 not only 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.830
 what you think the game itself but 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.660
 about everything that meant for the 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.490
 survival horror genre you are of the 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.710
 what do you think was the death of the 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.810
 gender at least for a while you think 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.940
 that was a necessary evolution a 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.889
 involution maybe I would take jce some 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.050
 elements and would discard is other if 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:24.060
 Do you have any opinion about it? 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.060
 you cut in the comments until then
