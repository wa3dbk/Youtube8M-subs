00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
tablespoon and another half and now I'm

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.650 
tablespoon and another half and now I'm
just<00:00:47.930> going<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.170> add<00:00:48.379> some<00:00:48.890> color<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.660> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
just going to add some color to the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.020 
just going to add some color to the
water<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.290> easier<00:00:51.829> if<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.190> use<00:00:52.460> color<00:00:52.670> paste

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
water it's easier if you use color paste

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.600 
water it's easier if you use color paste
which<00:00:53.390> gives<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> best<00:00:54.340> intensity<00:00:55.340> of

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
which gives you the best intensity of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.920 
which gives you the best intensity of
color<00:00:55.850> it's<00:00:56.660> best<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.110> add<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> water

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
color it's best to add it to the water

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.459 
color it's best to add it to the water
it's<00:00:59.930> much<00:01:00.110> easier<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.500> blend<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:03.110> now<00:01:03.290> I've

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
it's much easier to blend in so now I've

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.670 
it's much easier to blend in so now I've
got<00:01:04.420> some<00:01:05.420> food<00:01:05.630> color<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.110> water<00:01:06.259> I'm

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
got some food color in the water I'm

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.020 
got some food color in the water I'm
just<00:01:06.890> going<00:01:07.009> to<00:01:07.040> add<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.550> little<00:01:07.940> at<00:01:08.000> a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
just going to add that a little at a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:21.080 
just going to add that a little at a
time<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:11.800> then<00:01:12.800> mix<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.340> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.980 

now<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> whole<00:01:22.200> tablespoon<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.979> water

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
now that's a whole tablespoon of water

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.319 
now that's a whole tablespoon of water
and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> may<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
and I may need a little more but I'm

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.090 
and I may need a little more but I'm
just<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> spend<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.649> little<00:01:28.920> while

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
just going to spend a little while

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.779 
just going to spend a little while
trying<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.740> liquid

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
trying to get all the liquid

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:43.100 
trying to get all the liquid
incorporated<00:01:41.119> I'm<00:01:42.119> adding<00:01:42.390> another<00:01:42.630> half<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
incorporated I'm adding another half a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.510 
incorporated I'm adding another half a
tablespoon<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.619> best<00:01:46.829> thing<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.399> add

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
tablespoon the best thing is just to add

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
tablespoon the best thing is just to add
a<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.840> find<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
a bit at that time if you do find that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.950 
a bit at that time if you do find that
you<00:01:49.320> add<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.860> much<00:01:49.890> water<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> always

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you add too much water you can always

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.410 
you add too much water you can always
add<00:01:52.200> some<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:52.530> icing<00:01:52.710> sugar<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
add some more icing sugar to get the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:14.670 
add some more icing sugar to get the
mixture<00:01:54.720> thicker<00:01:55.049> again

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.850 

now<00:02:15.680> I'm<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.540> using<00:02:17.540> quite<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> lot<00:02:18.740> of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
now I'm just using quite a lot of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.580 
now I'm just using quite a lot of
pressure<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.780> get<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> mixture<00:02:21.170> smooth

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
pressure to get the mixture smooth

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.110 
pressure to get the mixture smooth
obviously<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.400> use<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.640> electric<00:02:22.970> whisk

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
obviously you can use the electric whisk

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.600 
obviously you can use the electric whisk
for<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.500> quite<00:02:24.740> an<00:02:24.860> easy<00:02:25.040> job<00:02:25.400> to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
for this but it's quite an easy job to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.110 
for this but it's quite an easy job to
do<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.970> with<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.209> wooden<00:02:26.420> spoon<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.959> bowl

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
do this with a wooden spoon and a bowl

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.010 
do this with a wooden spoon and a bowl
now<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.290> about<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.620> consistency<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.310> want

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
now this is about the consistency I want

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.420 
now this is about the consistency I want
they<00:02:33.020> can<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.319> stay<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.920> cake<00:02:34.160> but

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
they can have to stay on the cake but

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.890 
they can have to stay on the cake but
runny<00:02:34.610> enough<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.090> able<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.360> ice<00:02:37.750> now<00:02:38.750> I'm

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
runny enough to be able to ice now I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.000 
runny enough to be able to ice now I'm
going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> use<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> palette<00:02:39.739> knife<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:45.440> put

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
going to use a palette knife to just put

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.090 
going to use a palette knife to just put
a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.220> icing<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.880> top<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.860> smooth<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
a little icing on top and smooth it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.860 
a little icing on top and smooth it
around<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.940> can<00:02:53.090> see<00:02:53.269> that's<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
around and you can see that's just the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.570 
around and you can see that's just the
right<00:02:54.050> consistency<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.980> not<00:02:55.100> running<00:02:55.459> off

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
right consistency it's not running off

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.240 
right consistency it's not running off
the<00:02:55.760> cake<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.590> nice<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.040> easy<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:01.040> put

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the cake but it's nice and easy to put

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.690 
the cake but it's nice and easy to put
on<00:03:01.370> there<00:03:02.239> we<00:03:02.360> have<00:03:02.510> it
