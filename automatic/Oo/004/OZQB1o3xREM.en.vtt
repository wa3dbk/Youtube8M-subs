00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 and everyone then today I 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.190
 offers makeup in the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.259
 plum tanks that's the makeup that I 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 wore in my video I showed you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.849
 amount the time I understood that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 I managed to make some standing 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 it's a video that's a bit old 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 who is over a year old but it's the video 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.869
 who is the most watched on my channel 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.430
 and so I have very very comments 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.109
 regularly every week there are 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.820
 people who are discovering this video and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.840
 so we asked for makeup and I 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.529
 you do this not a little parenthesis 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 reassure me title but that you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 happens right now every day when 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.309
 I wear makeup I find it super ugly 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 every day I tell myself that it 's all right 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.680
 the days I am disappointed and every day 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 I want to remove my makeup but I do not 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.129
 do not do it because I do not have time 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 and that clearly make me clean and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.020
 remaquillÃ© it's always worse 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 so I do not do it but I think there is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 it's bad joke or so it's 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 because I take my winter time 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.020
 I do not know but I feel that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 everything is rotten so short bah I you 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.800
 shows the ideal spa plum for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.660
 green eyes very obviously blue eyes 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.430
 but very pretty for all colors 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.369
 god but that's particularly 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.659
 bring out the green eyes that's what that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.580
 given 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 so I started with this blush cream of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.010
 toubib called burgundy all 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.159
 simply 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.320
 it is a lighthouse that can very well be 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.850
 wear alone then I advise you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 to work it fast enough because they 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.009
 dry quickly and that's it becomes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.229
 quickly complicated the move or 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 give up so that's why 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.799
 I do it with a brush because in fact 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 I put a lot of it the one decides and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.000
 then after jeans less and less and that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 helps me a lot in the blurred actually 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.150
 so here we go a little sweeter 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.610
 and I do not add any products on the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.610
 brush and management for the hollow 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 you can it's the job and to 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.649
 fingers like with the heat of the break 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 it's a little easier it does 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.920
 to melt a little bit and there we forget 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 not to go a little behind there at 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.630
 level of crow's feet is not it 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.099
 so it does not happen often 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.840
 I forget this little door he's not 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.640
 very beautiful and then on the same bread 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.099
 sow that's a mac 119 I believe I the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 take underneath vegetables eyelashes and 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.080
 I do it join the in the corner there 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 like I wanted 10 and a plum and ben 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 here we can very well wear it all 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.870
 alone without problem what is top is 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.860
 that they will hold what I will have because 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.769
 that as I told you they are drying 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.530
 pretty fast but suddenly it's way 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.880
 easy for the festival but against 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.390
 that's great because silly really 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.970
 all day 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.830
 then I took a brush a little 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.049
 wide like that it's an old sephora 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.950
 am here and I took the plum from the 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.080
 pallet ultra matt v2 of slick make-up 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.580
 that is here 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.340
 so there is a little powdery but 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.739
 frankly I love the color and 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 still pretty pigmented so that 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.190
 goes the skin side of Rome I can not anymore 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.950
 that and I'm just tapping over the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.140
 blush cream and suddenly it matifies all that 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.239
 it remains a little bit of shine 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.239
 but really really little 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.510
 I also want all under the eye 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.550
 then the end be emma who are 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.239
 really good to fade the action to 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.209
 2 euros 50 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.370
 that's the price because it's after 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.510
 for a little while so I'm crazy that their 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.220
 colleagues from the super duke and carts 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.959
 not to forget so this one is clean 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.250
 and suddenly the ample gesture the color 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:04.470
 so that the contours are much 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:05.670
 more blurry and see if that makes you 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.170
 little falls there I think you 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.110
 see what we do either take you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.730
 scotch be like that you and go that 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 make great farting and after you re 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.450
 spread your concealer or your background 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.669
 complexion 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.320
 even without adding a fact but in 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.010
 taking your foundation brush 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.900
 clean up a bit you can do it 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.889
 all in the end if you prefer I like 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.720
 well do it a close since 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.729
 as I do not see anything and I am very 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.110
 able to forget that I had 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.100
 clean it I see nothing and fell in 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.410
 the air so it's a little bit 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.520
 catastrophic and so if I forget I'm 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.100
 troll all day it's already me 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.330
 arrived that's why 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.990
 Then I take this big of a young boxer 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 beautiful blake from sephora is a jumbo 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.970
 for the eyelids but it's a superb 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.410
 waterproof so I put it in the right 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.680
 mood but not all day and I 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.680
 do too 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.400
 one does not play much until half 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.770
 and after I can a little brush 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.389
 beveled like this one it's a game 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.789
 it will be necessary too and I took the black 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.500
 of the planet were two and you 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.910
 take in the north that you have and 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.710
 I have a little bit I put 2 g 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.199
 actually lined the line of eyelashes just 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.240
 to make it to the little girl 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:25.400
 black who could well and of course 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.169
 after I spread my mascara so there 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.030
 I took mascara plates and 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:35.120
 tube chains i and I did well the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:40.610
 zig zag like that hop help us all and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.780
 everything and everything gently reassembled I hold 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.199
 to make a special dedication to 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.060
 neighbors 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.470
 I sleep with earplugs because 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.349
 I have student neighbors who are a 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.630
 little bit noisy that woke me up 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.880
 despite my earplugs at 6:44 am 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.190
 singing in the hallway and slamming 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.810
 the door on the other hand the wings love you

 then I take orange pop this blush of 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.430
 at sephora then he is a little bit more 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.200
 keen that 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.840
 the image that gives to the camera but 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.590

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.919
 just the beginning of the audois era 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.750
 to be less clear 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:13.280
