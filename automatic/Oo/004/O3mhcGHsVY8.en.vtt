the frame is now internally wired so the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.899 
the frame is now internally wired so the
wires<00:02:06.469> come<00:02:06.679> out<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.979> battery<00:02:07.459> box<00:02:07.670> area

wires come out of the battery box area

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.789 
wires come out of the battery box area
go<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:08.329> through<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.569> frame<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.079> they<00:02:09.619> come

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
go up through the frame and they come

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:19.509 
go up through the frame and they come
out<00:02:09.890> underneath<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.369> tank<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:19.130> those<00:02:19.280> wires

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
out underneath the tank so those wires

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.479 
out underneath the tank so those wires
then<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.299> up<00:02:20.420> into<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.780> handlebars
