so that's my main recommendation for why

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.170

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
people should do it that way but that's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.810 
people should do it that way but that's
just<00:04:30.330> me<00:04:30.539> it's<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.009> comes<00:04:32.220> down<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.699> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
just me it's really it comes down to the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.430 
just me it's really it comes down to the
job<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.389> want<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.990> fact<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.350> is
