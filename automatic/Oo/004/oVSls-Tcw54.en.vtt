00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.770 
Death Star is 160 thousand meters
therefore<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.070> volume<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.850> Duster<00:03:11.600> which

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
therefore the volume of the Duster which

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.340 
therefore the volume of the Duster which
in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.020> sphere<00:03:12.080> would<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.940> V<00:03:13.940> equals<00:03:14.480> pi<00:03:14.900> times

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
in the sphere would be V equals pi times

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.650 
in the sphere would be V equals pi times
the<00:03:15.680> radius<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.640> third<00:03:16.820> power<00:03:17.030> divided<00:03:17.570> by

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
the radius to the third power divided by

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.900 
the radius to the third power divided by
6<00:03:17.960> this<00:03:18.710> comes<00:03:18.950> out<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.130> be<00:03:19.370> three<00:03:19.580> point<00:03:19.850> one

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
6 this comes out to be three point one

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.530 
6 this comes out to be three point one
four<00:03:20.030> four<00:03:20.630> times<00:03:20.960> ten<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> fifteenth

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
four four times ten to the fifteenth

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.780 
four four times ten to the fifteenth
therefore<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.660> bass<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:25.070> density<00:03:25.520> times

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
therefore the bass is the density times

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.660 
therefore the bass is the density times
the<00:03:26.300> volume<00:03:26.720> which<00:03:27.620> our<00:03:27.830> match<00:03:28.040> comes<00:03:28.400> out<00:03:28.550> to

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
the volume which our match comes out to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.850 
the volume which our match comes out to
be<00:03:28.700> six<00:03:29.090> point<00:03:29.660> 0<00:03:29.870> 0<00:03:29.900> times<00:03:30.380> 10<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
be six point 0 0 times 10 to the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.280 
be six point 0 0 times 10 to the
eighteenth<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:32.420> compensate<00:03:33.020> for<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.260> fact

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
eighteenth we compensate for the fact

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.220 
eighteenth we compensate for the fact
that<00:03:33.620> stars<00:03:34.280> probably<00:03:34.910> fifty<00:03:35.300> percent<00:03:35.600> hollow

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
that stars probably fifty percent hollow

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.010 
that stars probably fifty percent hollow
so<00:03:36.680> then<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:36.980> divide<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.460> by<00:03:37.580> two<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:38.570> get<00:03:38.690> done

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
so then we divide it by two to get done

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.190 
so then we divide it by two to get done

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.350 
answer that we have here we use this

natural<00:03:44.870> gravity<00:03:45.940> we<00:03:46.940> use<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.270> gravitational

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020

we'll start with the equation that tells

we'll start with the equation that tells
you<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.710> potential<00:05:21.190> energy<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.640> an<00:05:21.850> object
