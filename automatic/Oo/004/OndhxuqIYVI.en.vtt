doubt it we discussed the chaining them

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.510 
doubt it we discussed the chaining them
and<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.440> both<00:00:44.070> fighting<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.460> the

this<00:00:46.710> agree<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> disagree<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.680> overall<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this agree to disagree so overall was a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
this agree to disagree so overall was a
great<00:00:50.010> day<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> brand<00:00:50.489> Chevy<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:51.000> first

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
great day for the brand Chevy we first

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.229 
great day for the brand Chevy we first
top<00:00:51.930> five<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> while<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.760> we<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> strong

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
top five in a while and we had a strong

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
top five in a while and we had a strong
car<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.079> last<00:00:55.260> wrong<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> were<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
car we just that last wrong we were just

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
car we just that last wrong we were just
way<00:00:55.980> too<00:00:56.039> tight<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.899> struggled<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:57.989> bit

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
way too tight and struggled a little bit

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.660 
way too tight and struggled a little bit
so<00:00:58.379> hopefully<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.160> carry<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.489> momentum

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so hopefully we can carry this momentum

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
so hopefully we can carry this momentum
