00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.260

 xiao ming new proposal for the xiaoming 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.420
 already or could have thrown me for another 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.180
 side pulling out the tsja or I go saying 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.740
 with taking out the zombie 5 but I preferred to take 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.540
 another way that is the path of 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.250
 fables that you are seeing that currently 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 in the market is what sells the most and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.820
 what is most in demand and what are the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.020
 small screens that are not sold 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 what good on small screens 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.390
 relatively because currently a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.370
 5 inch screen that would be an s 41 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.260
 is 5 already begins to consider a 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.660
 small and good screen both 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.190
 xiaomi's proposals are yao ming out 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.650
 that is known in this video and the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.090
 xiaoming out but that domino but it would be 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.920
 as a big brother the vital version 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.540
 hoisting this model that you're going to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.070
 watch this video so good if you want 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.260
 to arrange this model, we must not leave 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.000
 the video for them to pass and you can 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.979
 have more information about this 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.560
 terminal and good the description apart 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.440
 leave the other video between naut pro I'm going 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.910
 to leave a link to a full post on 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.210
 which if you want to know more information 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.220
 of which we speak in the video 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 about these two terminals you will be able to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.690
 access it valence a post that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 write we have written on the website of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 the editors below the link 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 know a lot of information about these 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.450
 two models good winehouse was a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 relatively large phone of a 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.100
 5-inch screen with 7 inches 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.140
 This screen is made by sharp 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.770
 your resolution will be full hd reduction 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.679
 and its essence of pixels per inch will be 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.700
 386 will also feature technology 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.819
 gorilla glass 3 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 the phone will have dimensions of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:22.390
 155 mm high 71 mm wide and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.690
 6 95 millimeters thick 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.519
 really fine in addition it will only weigh 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.290
 161 grams if we open the phone by 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.830
 inside we will find a processor 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.180
 snapdragon 801 that runs at 2.5 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.069
 gigahertz 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.730
 this will be accompanied by a gpu 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.959
 Adreno 330 and 3 gigabytes of ram the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.769
 phone we will find it in two 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.530
 16 and 64 gb of storage and 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 in two colors black and white your battery 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.030
 it will be 3000 thousand amps apparently 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.950
 At first glance, it is a good 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.230
 powerful battery but until you do not 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.569
 have but try the terminal 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.400
 Well we will not know if it really is 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.769
 good battery ie will give us a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.349
 good duration to the terminal or not in addition 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.760
 this will be accompanied by widgets 2.0 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.470
 that is a new technology that she 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120
 you can meet by other terminals as 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 for example serial motorola droid turbo 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 or Motorola Google Nexus 6 that we 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.819
 will allow you to order the phone in the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080
 Half the time if we go to the camera 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.660
 back your camera 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.020
 it was 13 megapixels with a sony sensor 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.210
 in this case the model m x 214 will count 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.640
 with optical stabilization and opening 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.230
 focal 2.0 as it is logical also 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.960
 will incorporate a led flash that in this 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.130
 case is developed by phillips yes 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.380
 we go to his front camera we 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.500
 we found a 4 megapixel camera 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.970
 and these pixels would be 2 microns in 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.670
 As for connectivity, everything points to 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.460
 this terminal will come fully equipped 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.180
 will not have 4g than what would be the wifi 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.520
 bluetooth wi-fi direct nfc etcetera like 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.930
 I tell you all the connectivity possible in 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.900
 4 android version there is nothing 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.270
 confirmed in my opinion the ideal would be 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.459
 that came directly with lollipop 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.650
 but the rumors suggest that it will come 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.240
 with kitkat and after the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.400
 release then they will be updated to 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.140
 lollipop in my opinion this would be a 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.940
 delay because whenever they do this the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.220
 updates are delaying and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.959
 it's basically an excuse to not put 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.490
 lollipop directly 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.070
 we hope as I tell you in my case what 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.109
 ideal would be that I put the lollipop but 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.530
 the rumors do not point to that as soon as 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.889
 at the price in china it will go to 2,290 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.220
 joanes and that the change would be in 315 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.710
 euros is an expensive and cheap price is a 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.990
 cheap price if we compare it with the 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.310
 other brands and it's an expensive price if 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.750
 with what we compare with the rest of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.700
 Vale models is one of the most models 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.500
 expensive that has taken xiaoming however 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.150
 if we left the market and I 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.130
 compared with other phones 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.020
 the actuality is a terminal really 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.639
 cheap if we consider the very 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.080
 good specifications that this brings 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.660
 terminal in terms of departure date 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.520
 we still do not know when 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.320
 will present so good to be attentive 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.790
 to the channel and social networks because 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.620
 if we have any news what 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.090
 we'll post through there and good 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.220
 this would be all that is known about this 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.870

 quality-price some explanation with 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.919
 your car themes like it's less worth putting 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.240
 I work in the comments and good here 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.979
 we finished this video right now I'm going to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.930
 leave two other videos that surely 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.430
 may interest you that they are 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.320
 pretty good ones how can 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.479
 recover files that you have deleted 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.300
 before on your android is to say yes 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.729
 is ever deleted 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.099
 the image or some file and you want it 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.569

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.310
 I teach you a kind of trash can 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.090
 recycling to be able to recover their 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.830
 records 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.990
 the other video that I 'm going to leave here is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.120
 a video of how to have free internet 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.610

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.930
 that I teach another medium that is also 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.759
 quite cash so I recommend that 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.389
 you go through these two videos so 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.830
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.840

 Blessed, I say goodbye next time
