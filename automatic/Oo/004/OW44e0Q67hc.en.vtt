00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.279
 Ruler after both 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.279
 of the aft 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.929
 I was lying on the edge 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090
 that 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 Let's take the turn 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.780
 one and a half just the right point 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.780
 stay in line 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.930
 stopped a turn and a half right and stopped 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.930
 one and a half turn to the right 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.890
 I look okay 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.290
 now you can even close the door to 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 hear right here 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 It's going to be more awkward for this one more. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.789
 Little bit of a wheel back to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 left is missing very good 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.590
 the arrow to the right was the defendant 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.939
 the right arrow 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 it was everything to the right 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.170
 Hello 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.829
 He came very entered 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.799
 although you can not do that it was 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.380
 the first bit ahead but already 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.850
 can not do this 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.280
 Only we see it stopped a little longer. 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.830
 for the effort so much more that you 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.130
 entered is doing just to demonstrate the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.310
 campaign rule everything to the left no 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.320
 there is room for the back entrance and 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.980
 forward line as the film was 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.980
 all to the left 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.300
 turn everything to the left bolatti 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.850
 Come on, I 've already begun to realize that 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.040
 right rear wheel 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.040
 she is approaching and will line up 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.100
 I started, let's approach, but we have 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.100
 22 years will be observed the curb 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.670
 and it happens a bit more 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.560
 stopped at the ceiling 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.830
 we perceive space left between the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.360
 car and the cone where we understand 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.200
 so that the point still passed a little 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200
 everything to the right 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.630
 to hit but I think it will not 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.280
 this image 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.280
 for as long as this ox cart 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.650
 stopped at a wheel 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.670
 we realize that it happens to a 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.380
 More 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.380
 the forrÃ³ band 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.239
 they will do another task
