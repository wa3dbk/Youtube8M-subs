00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that if I use direct flash with no light

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.510 
that if I use direct flash with no light
sphere<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.899> really

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
sphere I would have a really

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
sphere I would have a really
objectionable<00:00:50.520> shadow<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.750> see

light<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> eyes<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:58.050> comes<00:00:58.410> from<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
light on the eyes which comes from the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.430 
light on the eyes which comes from the
front<00:00:59.250> surface<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> light<00:01:00.239> sphere

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
front surface of the light sphere

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
front surface of the light sphere

blinking lights going on is going to be

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.210 
blinking lights going on is going to be
absolutely<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.790> nightmare<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.770> lighting

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

absolutely a nightmare for your lighting
it's<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.119> lights<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.689> over<00:01:48.750> your

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it's gonna put lights all over your

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's gonna put lights all over your
subject<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.460> terrible<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.930> when

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
subject and it's just terrible but when

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
subject and it's just terrible but when
you<00:01:52.229> use<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> light<00:01:52.799> sphere<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.369> allows<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you use the light sphere it allows you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389 
you use the light sphere it allows you
to<00:01:54.390> give<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.780> very<00:01:55.079> soft<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.890> illumination

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to give a very soft even illumination

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.539 
to give a very soft even illumination
but<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.869> blow<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> background<00:01:59.070> nor

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
but will not blow out the background nor

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
but will not blow out the background nor
will<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.060> throw<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.689> shadow<00:02:01.049> while<00:02:01.979> you're

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
will it throw in a shadow while you're

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.520 
will it throw in a shadow while you're
shooting<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.119> gives<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
shooting so this gives just this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.630 
when you're shooting wedding photography
it's<00:02:20.060> crucial<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.950> why<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> designed

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it's crucial and that's why I designed

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's crucial and that's why I designed
it<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> reason

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
it because of this this is the reason

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.559 
it because of this this is the reason
that<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.310> light<00:02:29.550> sphere<00:02:29.700> when<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.239> ever

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
that I have a light sphere when I'm ever

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.080 
that I have a light sphere when I'm ever
I'm<00:02:30.810> shooting<00:02:31.260> flash<00:02:31.920> now<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.910> my

I'm shooting flash now one of my

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
I'm shooting flash now one of my
assistants<00:02:33.599> actually<00:02:34.019> took<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.410> shot<00:02:34.650> right

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
assistants actually took this shot right

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.000 
assistants actually took this shot right
here<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:36.060> an<00:02:36.390> off-camera<00:02:37.200> flash<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.830> as

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
here with an off-camera flash just as

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
here with an off-camera flash just as
and<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.370> isn't<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.879> color<00:02:39.120> balanced<00:02:39.629> or

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and this isn't in color balanced or

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.089 
and this isn't in color balanced or
anything<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.650> can<00:02:40.739> kind<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
anything like that so you can kind of

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.190 
anything like that so you can kind of
see<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> metering<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.120> weird<00:02:42.959> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
see that the metering is weird and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.979 
see that the metering is weird and
whatever<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.099> can<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.459> right<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.120> that

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
whatever but you can see right here that
