00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
how quickly you grasp the concept

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.280 
how quickly you grasp the concept
there's<00:02:14.610> literally<00:02:15.540> four<00:02:15.870> things<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
there's literally four things that you

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.250 
there's literally four things that you
need<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.709> push<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> clutch<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.820> shift<00:02:18.630> push

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
or pull the clutch out while you're

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.780 
or pull the clutch out while you're
giving<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> car<00:02:21.120> gas<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.540> that's<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:23.340> here

giving the car gas and that's it so here

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.949 
giving the car gas and that's it so here
we<00:02:23.910> go<00:02:28.100> into<00:02:29.100> gear<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.720> off<00:02:30.840> the

now if you're in a higher gear and you
need<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> get<00:02:51.959> like<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.470> hill<00:02:52.709> which<00:02:53.280> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
need to get like up a hill which is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.410 
need to get like up a hill which is
going<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.610> happen<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> second<00:02:54.330> my

going to happen here in a second my
car's<00:02:54.630> gonna<00:02:54.720> start<00:02:54.989> whining<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.709> in

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
car's gonna start whining because I'm in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.000 
car's gonna start whining because I'm in
a<00:02:55.890> lower<00:02:56.100> gear<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:57.810> accomplish<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
a lower gear and to accomplish that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.160 
a lower gear and to accomplish that
first<00:02:59.580> clutch<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.150> shift<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> gear

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
first clutch in and shift down a gear

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.720 
first clutch in and shift down a gear
and<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:02.250> will<00:03:02.400> pull<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.820> up

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.130 

now<00:03:06.730> when<00:03:06.879> you<00:03:06.970> need<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.239> come<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.599> stop<00:03:07.870> there

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
now when you need to come to stop there

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.720 
now when you need to come to stop there
are<00:03:08.260> two<00:03:08.379> different<00:03:08.680> trains<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> thumb<00:03:09.250> one

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
are two different trains the thumb one

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.660 
are two different trains the thumb one
is<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.360> downshift<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:11.370> slow<00:03:12.370> down<00:03:12.519> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
is that you downshift to slow down the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.699 
is that you downshift to slow down the
car<00:03:12.819> which<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.060> called<00:03:13.299> engine<00:03:13.599> braking<00:03:13.840> which

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
car which is called engine braking which

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.640 
car which is called engine braking which
is<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.069> I'm<00:03:15.159> doing<00:03:15.370> right<00:03:15.459> now<00:03:16.260> basically<00:03:17.260> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
is what I'm doing right now basically it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.770 
is what I'm doing right now basically it
uses<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.250> critical<00:03:18.730> force<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.299> weight<00:03:19.540> of

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
uses this critical force and weight of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.149 
uses this critical force and weight of
the<00:03:19.959> car<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.709> slow<00:03:21.129> the<00:03:21.730> engine<00:03:21.879> down<00:03:26.159> whereas

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
the car to slow the engine down whereas

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.460 
the car to slow the engine down whereas
you<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.819> also<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.569> take<00:03:28.690> your<00:03:28.870> foot<00:03:29.019> off<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you can also just take your foot off the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.130 
you can also just take your foot off the
clutch<00:03:30.329> sorry<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.450> take<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.659> car<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
clutch sorry to take the car out of the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.130 
clutch sorry to take the car out of the
gear<00:03:32.319> or<00:03:32.680> out<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:32.980> gear<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:34.150> just<00:03:34.870> let

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
gear or out of gear and then just let

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.030 
gear or out of gear and then just let
the<00:03:35.170> car<00:03:35.409> coast<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.069> a<00:03:36.129> stop<00:03:36.159> using<00:03:36.819> your<00:03:37.510> brain

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.380 

so<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.129> need<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.400> get<00:03:42.519> on<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.700> highway<00:03:42.849> and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
so you need to get on the highway and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.119 
so you need to get on the highway and
you<00:03:43.450> realize<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.290> you're<00:03:44.620> not<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:44.920> this

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
you realize that you're not going this

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.759 
you realize that you're not going this
passes<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.549> traffic<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:47.109> passing<00:03:47.650> you

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
passes the traffic that is passing you

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.250 
passes the traffic that is passing you
by<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.790> speed<00:03:49.180> up<00:03:49.359> or<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.840> get<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.989> little<00:03:50.079> bit

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
by to speed up or to get a little bit

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.680 
by to speed up or to get a little bit
extra<00:03:50.440> torque<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.220> engine<00:03:51.730> power<00:03:51.909> if<00:03:52.450> you're

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
extra torque and engine power if you're

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.660 
extra torque and engine power if you're
in<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.870> lower<00:03:53.019> gear<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.680> could<00:03:53.859> downshift<00:03:54.430> and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
in a lower gear you could downshift and

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.300 
in a lower gear you could downshift and
then<00:03:55.390> get<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.230> more<00:03:56.440> gas<00:03:56.650> which<00:03:56.980> are<00:03:57.159> then

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
then get the more gas which are then

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.420 
then get the more gas which are then
howling<00:03:57.909> power<00:03:58.090> or<00:03:58.390> faster<00:03:59.200> obviously<00:03:59.950> you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
howling power or faster obviously you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.500 
howling power or faster obviously you
want<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:00.670> make<00:04:00.819> sure<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.090> you're<00:04:01.269> within

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
want to make sure that you're within

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.940 
want to make sure that you're within
your<00:04:02.230> correct

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
your correct

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.920 
your correct
rev<00:04:03.519> range<00:04:03.760> because<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.510> don't<00:04:04.659> end<00:04:04.870> up

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
rev range because you don't end up

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.599 
rev range because you don't end up
redlining<00:04:05.379> your<00:04:05.620> car<00:04:05.799> just<00:04:06.069> because<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> need

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
redlining your car just because you need

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.379 
redlining your car just because you need
to<00:04:06.760> downshift<00:04:08.549> some<00:04:09.549> people<00:04:09.819> ask<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.269> know

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
to downshift some people ask you know

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.110 
to downshift some people ask you know
what's<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.750> appropriate<00:04:11.700> RPM<00:04:12.700> range<00:04:12.880> I

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
what's the appropriate RPM range I

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.339 
what's the appropriate RPM range I
should<00:04:13.299> be<00:04:13.389> shifting<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.930> should<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:14.230> be

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
should be shifting and should it be

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.839 
should be shifting and should it be
really<00:04:14.620> low<00:04:14.799> should<00:04:15.099> be<00:04:15.190> really<00:04:15.430> high<00:04:15.609> should

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
really low should be really high should

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.940 
really low should be really high should
be<00:04:15.880> right<00:04:16.060> in<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.180> middle<00:04:16.329> in<00:04:16.539> all<00:04:17.410> honesty<00:04:17.769> it

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
be right in the middle in all honesty it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.979 
be right in the middle in all honesty it
should<00:04:18.160> be<00:04:18.340> pretty<00:04:18.729> much<00:04:18.940> right<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
