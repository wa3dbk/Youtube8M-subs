the second or the frame before he gets
shot<00:01:36.979> one<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> two<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.330> split<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.750> right

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
shot one of the two or to split it right

when it gets shot and make sure you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.310 
when it gets shot and make sure you
split<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.330> top<00:01:41.540> clips<00:01:41.840> throwing<00:01:42.140> up<00:01:42.229> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
split the top clips throwing up the

split the top clips throwing up the
bottom<00:01:42.560> clip<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.820> can<00:01:43.970> delete

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
bottom clip and you can delete

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.990 
bottom clip and you can delete
everything<00:01:44.479> before<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:46.460> depending<00:01:46.880> on

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
everything before and then depending on

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.730 
everything before and then depending on
how<00:01:47.180> long<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.509> want<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.720> effect<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.259> LA<00:01:48.410> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
how long you want the effect to LA so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.790 
how long you want the effect to LA so
we'll<00:01:49.429> just<00:01:49.490> say<00:01:49.850> about<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.479> second<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.500> until

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
we'll just say about a second so until

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.630 
we'll just say about a second so until
2.28<00:01:53.530> also<00:01:54.530> looks<00:01:55.039> like<00:01:55.130> there

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
2.28 also looks like there

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.149 
2.28 also looks like there
and<00:01:57.360> split<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.260> again<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and split that again and then if you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.290 
and split that again and then if you
don't<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> again<00:01:59.760> on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.120> top

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
don't want to do it again on the top

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480 
don't want to do it again on the top
layer<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.870> can<00:02:00.900> just<00:02:01.229> dumb<00:02:01.440> delete<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> rest

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
layer you can just dumb delete the rest

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.820 
layer you can just dumb delete the rest
or<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.690> through<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> next<00:02:04.560> shot

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
or you can go through to the next shot

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.880 
or you can go through to the next shot
which<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.800> like

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
which is there and then go for like

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
which is there and then go for like
another<00:02:08.130> second<00:02:08.959> right<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.660> now<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
another second right there and now that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.840 
another second right there and now that
you've<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.370> it'll<00:02:14.370> look<00:02:14.459> no<00:02:14.670> different

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
you've got this it'll look no different

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.840 
you've got this it'll look no different
and<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.190> apply<00:02:17.640> your

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and what you can do is just apply your

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.900 
and what you can do is just apply your
effect<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.690> top<00:02:18.930> layer<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.100> say<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.760> get

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
effect to the top layer so say you get

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.850 
effect to the top layer so say you get
color<00:02:21.120> curves<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.380> what<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.650> use

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
color curves which is just what I use

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.590 
color curves which is just what I use
for<00:02:22.890> examples<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.850> quick<00:02:24.060> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
for examples because it's quick just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.690 
for examples because it's quick just
like<00:02:24.750> brighten<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.440> bit<00:02:25.470> something<00:02:26.310> it's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
like brighten it up a bit something it's

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.300 
like brighten it up a bit something it's
put<00:02:26.940> way<00:02:27.390> too<00:02:27.420> much<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.050> you'll<00:02:29.010> get<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> idea

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
put way too much but you'll get the idea

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.080 
put way too much but you'll get the idea
and<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.260> now<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:32.070> he<00:02:32.190> shoots<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.820> see<00:02:33.000> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and so now when he shoots you can see it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690 
and so now when he shoots you can see it
all<00:02:33.209> Bratton's<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.780> quite<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> bit<00:02:34.700> because

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
all Bratton's up quite a bit because

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.940 
all Bratton's up quite a bit because
they<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.000> brighten<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.470> bit<00:02:37.560> more

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.030 

I<00:02:41.900> wouldn't<00:02:42.900> recommend<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.410> brightening<00:02:43.890> up

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I wouldn't recommend just brightening up

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.559 
I wouldn't recommend just brightening up
like<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.670> looks<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> dodgy<00:02:45.420> but

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
like that that looks kind of dodgy but

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.119 
like that that looks kind of dodgy but
I'm<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:45.810> doing<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> lot<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.800> easy<00:02:47.010> for

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
I'm just doing it a lot so it's easy for

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.809 
I'm just doing it a lot so it's easy for
you<00:02:47.370> guys<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.790> see<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.640> don't

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
you guys to see so there and you don't

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.220 
you guys to see so there and you don't
want<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.300> stay<00:02:51.540> constant<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.110> whole

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
want to just stay constant the whole

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.470 
want to just stay constant the whole
time<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.680> want<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.160> fade<00:02:53.730> out<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.239> can

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
time you want it to fade out so you can

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
time you want it to fade out so you can
just<00:02:54.540> um<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.769> know<00:02:55.890> feed<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.340> both<00:02:56.459> out<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
just um you know feed them both out and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.940 
just um you know feed them both out and
then<00:02:57.120> when<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.330> look<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.800> Bratton's<00:02:58.800> up

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
then when you look at it Bratton's up

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.650 
then when you look at it Bratton's up
and<00:02:59.160> then<00:02:59.280> slowly<00:02:59.580> goes<00:02:59.819> back<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.209> normal<00:03:00.239> if

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and then slowly goes back to normal if

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.360 
and then slowly goes back to normal if
it's<00:03:01.530> too<00:03:01.709> long<00:03:01.920> shorten<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:04.280> clipboard<00:03:05.280> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's too long shorten the clipboard of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.640 
it's too long shorten the clipboard of
our<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.569> can<00:03:06.720> play<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> lot<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.620> different

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
our and you can play a lot of different

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.850 
our and you can play a lot of different
effects<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.299> got<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.709> go<00:03:10.830> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
effects to this so I got to so I go to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.420 
effects to this so I got to so I go to
comment<00:03:11.280> about<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:13.049> spin<00:03:13.500> blur<00:03:13.799> one<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.400> just

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
comment about that spin blur one so just

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.199 
comment about that spin blur one so just
delete<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.239> these<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.030> do

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
delete all these and you can just do

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.300 
delete all these and you can just do
this<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> single<00:03:18.989> layer<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.500> well<00:03:19.739> I'll<00:03:20.010> show

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
this on a single layer as well I'll show

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.789 
this on a single layer as well I'll show
you<00:03:20.400> both<00:03:20.519> ways<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.140> new<00:03:22.290> blue<00:03:22.440> effects

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
you both ways so in the new blue effects

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.050 
you both ways so in the new blue effects
there's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:24.019> there's<00:03:25.019> an<00:03:25.170> effect<00:03:25.530> called<00:03:26.060> spin

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
there's a there's an effect called spin

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.009 
there's a there's an effect called spin
blur<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:29.040> I'm<00:03:29.250> Tilly's<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.720> you

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
blur I think yeah so I'm Tilly's and you

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.680 
blur I think yeah so I'm Tilly's and you
can<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.290> apply<00:03:31.560> say<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.190> spin<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.420> top

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
can just apply say the spin to the top

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.350 
can just apply say the spin to the top
layer<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.519> then<00:03:35.519> when<00:03:35.670> he<00:03:35.760> shoots<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.209> all

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
layer and then when he shoots it all

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.750 
layer and then when he shoots it all
spins<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:38.030> then<00:03:39.030> fades<00:03:39.450> back<00:03:39.660> out<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.049> normal

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
spins and then fades back out to normal

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.309 
spins and then fades back out to normal
you<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:41.910> also<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.079> single

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
you can also do that on just a single

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.620 
you can also do that on just a single
layer<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.950> want<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.730> apply<00:03:45.480> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
layer if you want you can just apply it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.140 
layer if you want you can just apply it
and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.019> keyframe<00:03:46.790> I'll<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:47.970> show<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and then keyframe I'll just show you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.660 
and then keyframe I'll just show you
quickly<00:03:48.389> actually<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.950> if<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:50.130> turn<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> top

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
quickly actually so if we turn the top

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.789 
quickly actually so if we turn the top
layer<00:03:50.880> off<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.930> see<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:52.200> constant<00:03:52.680> but

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
layer off you can see it's constant but

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.849 
layer off you can see it's constant but
then<00:03:52.889> if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.160> click<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.430> your<00:03:53.609> event<00:03:53.910> effects

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
then if you click on your event effects

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.740 
then if you click on your event effects
move<00:03:55.859> this<00:03:56.010> out<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> way<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.670> go<00:03:57.450> forward

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
move this out of the way and go forward

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.190 
move this out of the way and go forward
to<00:03:58.019> where<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.380> want<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> start<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.190> there

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
to where you want it to start so there

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.340 
to where you want it to start so there
create<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> keyframe<00:04:01.609> delete<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:02.760> first<00:04:03.090> free

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
create a keyframe delete that first free

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.530 
create a keyframe delete that first free
delete<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.470> first<00:04:04.739> keyframe<00:04:04.950> go<00:04:05.940> back<00:04:06.180> one

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
delete that first keyframe go back one

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.039 
delete that first keyframe go back one
frame<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.290> turn<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> spin<00:04:07.920> 20<00:04:08.329> go<00:04:09.329> forward<00:04:09.810> to

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
frame and turn the spin 20 go forward to

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.470 
frame and turn the spin 20 go forward to
say<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.650> second<00:04:11.069> past<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.730> then<00:04:11.850> turn<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.239> spin

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
say a second past and then turn the spin

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.229 
say a second past and then turn the spin
back<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.780> Zurich<00:04:13.049> alright<00:04:13.920> um<00:04:14.130> sorry<00:04:14.850> my<00:04:15.060> phone

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
back to Zurich alright um sorry my phone

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.180 
back to Zurich alright um sorry my phone
just<00:04:15.269> rang<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:16.820> as<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.000> saying<00:04:18.359> keyframes<00:04:19.320> so

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
just rang but as I saying keyframes so

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.039 
just rang but as I saying keyframes so
now<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.340> get<00:04:20.489> shot<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:21.000> spins<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.690> then<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> nun

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
now I get shot it spins and then a nun

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.650 
now I get shot it spins and then a nun
spins<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.460> probably<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:24.000> better<00:04:24.389> way

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
spins this is probably a better way

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.930 
spins this is probably a better way
using<00:04:24.930> keyframes<00:04:25.500> because<00:04:26.160> as<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.789> can<00:04:26.849> see

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
using keyframes because as you can see

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.180 
using keyframes because as you can see
it<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.300> unspent<00:04:28.080> instead<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.710> fading<00:04:29.070> out

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it on unspent instead of just fading out

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.460 
it on unspent instead of just fading out
and<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.940> looks<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.150> bit<00:04:30.240> nicer

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
and it looks a bit nicer

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.410 
and it looks a bit nicer
our<00:04:32.040> says<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.580> effect<00:04:32.880> will<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.210> delete

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
our says that effect will just delete

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.500 
our says that effect will just delete
that<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:34.160> go<00:04:35.160> back<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.670> way<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:38.510> delete

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
that and go back to this way and delete

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.570 
that and go back to this way and delete
the<00:04:39.630> spin-off<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.140> one<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:41.370> do<00:04:41.460> all

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the spin-off this one I can do all

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.590

go forward to when you get shot and then
go<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.170> media<00:05:07.500> generators<00:05:07.890> then<00:05:08.400> stay

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
go to the media generators then stay

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.050 
go to the media generators then stay
color<00:05:09.030> gradient<00:05:09.540> or<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:09.900> solid<00:05:10.350> color<00:05:10.650> and

drag in say soft blue backdrop go

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.320 
drag in say soft blue backdrop go
forward<00:05:14.550> split<00:05:14.940> their<00:05:15.090> fed<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:15.990> out<00:05:16.170> and

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
forward split their fed this out and

the white one and drag it to transparent

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.110 
the white one and drag it to transparent
then<00:05:28.890> if<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:29.970> want<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.210> can<00:05:31.100> flip<00:05:32.100> this

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
then if you want you can flip this

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.490 
then if you want you can flip this
you<00:05:34.180> know<00:05:34.300> because<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:34.780> might<00:05:34.960> want<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.350> blue

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.200 
on top whatever and then you can play
around<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.800> blending<00:05:39.130> option<00:05:39.460> so<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.790> can

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
around the blending option so you can

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.719 
around the blending option so you can
try<00:05:40.570> screen<00:05:41.199> or<00:05:41.669> overlay<00:05:42.669> stuff<00:05:43.360> like<00:05:43.510> that

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
try screen or overlay stuff like that

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.409 
try screen or overlay stuff like that
you<00:05:45.729> know<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.760> it<00:05:48.760> gives<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.180> kind<00:05:49.389> of

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
you know and it gives that kind of

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.830 
you know and it gives that kind of
effect<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.139> also<00:05:50.260> fat<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:50.710> out<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.860> bit<00:05:50.949> and

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
effect you can also fat it out a bit and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.330 
effect you can also fat it out a bit and
play<00:05:52.840> off<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.139> few<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.530> those<00:05:53.590> different<00:05:53.830> colors

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.640 
play off a few of those different colors
and<00:05:54.870> gradients<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.020> everything<00:05:56.470> like<00:05:56.590> that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
and gradients and everything like that

can quickly create a really basic
particle<00:06:02.500> system<00:06:02.919> or<00:06:03.250> just<00:06:03.520> use<00:06:03.669> a<00:06:03.699> preset<00:06:04.270> and

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
particle system or just use a preset and

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.850 
particle system or just use a preset and
do<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.370> exact<00:06:06.699> same<00:06:06.729> thing<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.650> that's<00:06:08.650> how

do the exact same thing and that's how

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.640 
do the exact same thing and that's how
you<00:06:08.919> get<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.280> particles<00:06:09.840> flying<00:06:10.840> across<00:06:11.169> when

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
you get the particles flying across when
