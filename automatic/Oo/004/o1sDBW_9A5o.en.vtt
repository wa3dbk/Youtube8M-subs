00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.430
 today we join stéphanie in 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.129
 the yvelines to answer his 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.559
 stéphanie germany squad hello I 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.969
 you expect to firm up 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.820
 absolutely then the problem here it is 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.680
 will want garages that is all in 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.910
 end because of the rain and with the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.020
 children it's not practical 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.430
 so I have a good and a bad 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.380
 new the bad it's going to take 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.730
 break everything down ie tractopelle 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.439
 winner etc 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.149
 there will be a lot of work and the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.790
 good I have all edges auxerre that's all 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.649
 pretty good husband certainly to set 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.730
 work this building we take a picture 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.730
 thanks to a new application 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.920
 available on tablets which allows 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.520
 Stephanie to see the atmosphere already 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.410
 proposed 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 this new original application to 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.350
 allowed us to quickly determine 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.610
 with the customer the style that him 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.110
 corresponded so it's a view 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.270
 realistically that is to say that we take the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.770
 photo of the current state of the land and in 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.210
 five clicks can not show him 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.810
 quickly what that can give to the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.930
 end of construction 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.180
 the soil is loamy clay it holds back 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.640
 water on the surface the solution must be 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.490
 scratch flatten and redo a background of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.710
 draining and solid form 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.820
 it's the little after the big black widow 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 okay OK 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.210
 so stéphanie impressive we 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 feel like it's gonna make you no no no 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.470
 I trust 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.450
 Stephanie does not hesitate to stick to it for 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.430
 take off the impermeable crust from the ground 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.930
 caps and this is an essential phase 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.880
 for the success of this project for 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.000
 delimit the space we put borders 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.100
 rounded blocks and created to soften 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.880
 outlines of the go stéphanie has there too 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.429
 a good stroke of a mallet once caps 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 and we position the grave the bottom of 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.240
 shape that will offer all the strength to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.970
 the future hall and and will also allow 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.159
 to the water to evacuate easily the beautiful 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.350
 lady to the lady here is an adventure yet 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.299
 vibrating for stephanie it is necessary that the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.130
 ground be very compact and to receive 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.500
 the famous cell plates 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 the highlight of the show then stéphanie 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.569
 must be courageous to make 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.640
 gardens you see it rains it makes 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.799
 it's cold forehead it'll it'll it'll 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.360
 ask his famous honeycombed plates that 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.220
 are extraordinary that you see that you 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.349
 looks a bit like an integral of 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.970
 bee hives and on the other side you 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.380
 have a geotextile that will prevent 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 precisely the grass to push 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.420
 the chosen coating is plates 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.490
 alveolar filled with aggregates on 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.650
 gravel chosen is a clear gravel for 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.640
 to be harmonious with the house 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.560
 the advantage of these alveolar plates 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.480
 it is that it allows water to pass but 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.470
 also avoids the wild repousse the fat 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.670
 advantage of these plates 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.590
 it is because they are very resistant 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.370
 they can resist up to 300 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.300
 tons per square meter 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.300
 once filled with gravel 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.459
 so it used to be fossil 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.680
 small raclette 7/10 with this cold and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.860
 sport and pleasure very hot but 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.709
 unfortunately it's this flat beating 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.209
 cheese so now we're going to pull the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.239
 gravel for the master well by the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.239
 alveoli there like simple one poses one pulls 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.180
 Stephanie the family is together we are going 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.790
 take care of this little thing to hide 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.290
 this wall a little bit so we will use 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.950
 plants that will break this 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 perspective 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.600
 laurence mathieu finally françois stifani 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.730
 we go there to dress and masked ourselves 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.770
 drystone walls years I chose the cypress 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.840
 its strict-spirited side that grows in 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.760
 bomb height or fine foliage 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 which contrast with the rigor of the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 place since then there is an amiable fragrance that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.470
 offers a generous form and 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.200
 heather for their colorful touches 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.040
 Stephanie welcome to your home do you like 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.890
 that's wonderful 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.900
 we really have no taste it's 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.010
 solid this is not exactly 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.010
 with children it is very convenient 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.810
 it's really very very beautiful bet 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 managed to turn if I let you enjoy 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.190
 winter tours 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.190
 thank you so much 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.870
 it's here at raf 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
