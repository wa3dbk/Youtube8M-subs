there and then set your cruises and get
the<00:01:25.280> machine<00:01:25.610> working<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.240> really

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
the machine working and really

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.139 
the machine working and really
performing<00:01:27.170> well<00:01:27.549> where<00:01:28.549> does<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:28.820> fit<00:01:29.030> in

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
performing well where does this fit in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.480 
performing well where does this fit in
with<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.390> horsepower<00:01:29.719> bracket<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:31.100> look<00:01:31.340> we

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
with the horsepower bracket you look we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.630 
with the horsepower bracket you look we
quoted<00:01:31.820> as<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.090> 370<00:01:33.020> horsepower<00:01:33.140> tractor<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.100> it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
quoted as a 370 horsepower tractor so it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.670 
quoted as a 370 horsepower tractor so it
does<00:01:34.880> get<00:01:35.090> very<00:01:35.329> confusing<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:36.200> customers

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
does get very confusing for customers

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.230 
does get very confusing for customers
who<00:01:36.829> know<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.250> different<00:01:37.640> companies<00:01:37.909> quite

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
who know the different companies quite

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.840 
who know the different companies quite
different<00:01:38.630> figures<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.770> quote<00:01:40.070> 370

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
different figures so we quote 370

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.670 
different figures so we quote 370
horsepower<00:01:40.969> it's<00:01:41.509> up<00:01:41.659> at<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.140> maximum

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
horsepower it's up at the maximum

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.859 
horsepower it's up at the maximum
horsepower<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.060> rated<00:01:44.390> horsepower<00:01:44.780> is

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
horsepower so the rated horsepower is

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.680 
horsepower so the rated horsepower is
around<00:01:45.020> about<00:01:45.369> 360<00:01:46.369> horsepower

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
around about 360 horsepower

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.160 
around about 360 horsepower
5360<00:01:48.530> horsepower<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.190> then<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.720> EPM

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
5360 horsepower and then there the EPM

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.900 
5360 horsepower and then there the EPM
which<00:01:51.560> has<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.830> engine<00:01:52.280> power<00:01:52.520> management

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
which has a engine power management

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.420 
which has a engine power management
actually<00:01:53.750> boosts<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.440> power<00:01:54.650> by<00:01:54.890> another<00:01:55.160> 30

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
actually boosts the power by another 30

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.830 
actually boosts the power by another 30
horsepower<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:56.000> top<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.480> we<00:01:56.600> can

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
horsepower on top of that so we can

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
horsepower on top of that so we can
actually<00:01:56.990> get<00:01:57.260> 400<00:01:57.740> horsepower<00:01:57.980> out<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
actually get 400 horsepower out of it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.060 
actually get 400 horsepower out of it
but<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.300> quite<00:01:59.570> at<00:01:59.780> 370<00:02:00.560> because<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> true

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
but we quite at 370 because the true

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.850 
but we quite at 370 because the true
engine<00:02:01.370> horsepower<00:02:01.550> yeah<00:02:02.350> one<00:02:03.350> other<00:02:03.530> feature

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
engine horsepower yeah one other feature

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.530 
engine horsepower yeah one other feature
that<00:02:04.040> you<00:02:04.220> touched<00:02:04.460> on<00:02:04.670> earlier<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:05.300> when

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
that you touched on earlier on when

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.990 
that you touched on earlier on when
we're<00:02:05.690> doing<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.050> drive<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.310> felt<00:02:07.820> would

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
we're doing the drive that I felt would

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000 
we're doing the drive that I felt would
be<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.240> really<00:02:08.720> important<00:02:09.290> aspect<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
be a really important aspect to the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.590 
be a really important aspect to the
tractor<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.430> getting<00:02:10.760> horsepower<00:02:11.270> onto<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
tractor and getting horsepower onto the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.300 
tractor and getting horsepower onto the
ground<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.320> ties<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.830> you're<00:02:12.980> running

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
ground is it ties that you're running

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.490

out of the machine you need all much
rubbers<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.700> get<00:03:01.850> on<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.060> ground<00:03:02.270> and

rubbers we can get on the ground and
what<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.890> -<00:03:04.160> you're<00:03:04.459> saying<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
what I really like - you're saying the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.460 
what I really like - you're saying the
tires<00:03:05.180> don't<00:03:05.480> actually<00:03:05.720> expand<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.410> with

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
tires don't actually expand that with

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.470 
tires don't actually expand that with
you<00:03:07.010> more<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.370> lengthen<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.880> track<00:03:08.209> so

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you more just lengthen the track so

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.750 
you more just lengthen the track so
you're<00:03:08.750> nearly<00:03:08.989> getting<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.290> track<00:03:09.560> effect<00:03:09.980> by

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you're nearly getting a track effect by

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.100 
you're nearly getting a track effect by
lengthening<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.780> you're<00:03:11.989> not

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
lengthening that and you're not

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.110 
lengthening that and you're not
impacting<00:03:12.739> on<00:03:12.890> your<00:03:13.070> compaction<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> soil

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120

just increasing traction from my point

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.470 
just increasing traction from my point
of<00:03:16.370> view<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.610> first<00:03:16.820> thing<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.060> noticed<00:03:17.390> was

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
of view the first thing I noticed was

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.680 
of view the first thing I noticed was
jumping<00:03:18.050> into<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.350> tractor<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.519> steps<00:03:19.850> very

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
jumping into the tractor the steps very

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.930 
jumping into the tractor the steps very
nicely<00:03:20.959> graded<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.040> walk<00:03:22.550> straight

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
nicely graded so you can walk straight
