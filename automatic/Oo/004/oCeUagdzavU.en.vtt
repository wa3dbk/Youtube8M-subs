00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.790
 one of the questions that is pretty to me 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 often asked is the question of how i 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.930
 extract 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 motor from the car at a particular vaz 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 classic motor 11 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 on upgrading the stately engine of it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 complete extraction but pre 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.210
 Naturally all affairs are disconnected from 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 box unscrewed silencer supports 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.329
 engine unscrewed well and remove the radiator 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.449
 that is, all the pipes but the engine itself 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.609
 fully assembled state can 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.260
 By the way, here's the generator can be removed from 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.199
 the generator to pull it out, then I just 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 I prefer to shoot so slightly more convenient 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.019
 and I always shoot a distributor 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.649
 simply it does not accidentally damage to 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:06.390
 As a rope or trail I use 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.460
 seat belt with Lada make 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.080
 subaru give them one person 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.090
 gave the most reliable means 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 actually my winch top 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.870
 rails are installed here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.330
 which holds the roof 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.820
 foam plates and a winch that is this one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 here to rarely goes on bearings 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 the convenience is that I can move it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.910
 in particular , the car is now on 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 but I can move it not to 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.260
 next rail that is so like me 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.260
 conveniently 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.450
 after the recovery of the motor, now you can 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.090
 show I just did not speak before I 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.060
 happens to be different ways we do but 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.190
 particulars here is one of the options 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.420
 clutch cylinder stays on its 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.250
 at the same time when removing the engine 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.800
 you can push the clutch to pull it off 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.900
 Box secondly after 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.030
 engine pulled no need to eat 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.000
 down to substitute something under the box 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.580
 so that it is not much there perry leaned 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.120
 that is, it rests on this place 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.550
 on tie rod and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 that is, there is a box hanging on the tie rod 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.670
 by the way when extracting the motors 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.890
 do not need to remove the tie rod 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.910
 but when installed in order for it 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.160
 could put and not put 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.320
 some great effort i always 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.150
 tie rod removed and to 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.660
 she didn't disturb it was convenient where him 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.260
 to insert 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.739
 for further transport just 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.070
 same as the engine seat belt 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.930
 tied up the box and pants left in 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.680
 particular cereals and even honor that is 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.080
 she doesn't hurt anywhere 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:09.710
 further on the motor, I put a coup ki 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.280
 right in limbo well and on 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.280
 stand wu 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 this 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.299
 in the same way I take off the engines 

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:46.949
 of small types of foreign cars windows were traveling with 

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:49.229
 you then remove the engine together 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.459
 with a box of beer pulled out necessary 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.769
 disassemble the front part 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.659
 but on some all-wheel drive jeeps or 

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:56.699
 let's just say all-wheel drive 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:58.679
 car 2xu a couple of course need it on 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.179
 I do not lift lift 

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:03.019
 my height is not enough 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:05.399
 way difficult saying way simple but 

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:07.519
 Acting on this all thank you for 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.519
 Attention
