00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 we need paints they flew 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.090
 the flowers that you want to paint at 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 me go blue and a little turquoise 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.809
 I also have a special thing. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.210
 which makes everything from here to understand them 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 more pastel today try 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 never used to you this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.130
 did still need different bowls and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.990
 tassels and i advise using foil 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 with an awkward first thing you need to wash 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 head so how am i going to ask 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 only tips they pre me 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 already been blinded I don't want now 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 to get pretty bed margins 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:52.079
 it is necessary to mix paint in proportions 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:55.469
 one to one genius yes if that i 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.460
 it's like to uncover people 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.530
 I do in gloves I unfortunately do not 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 turned out to be a glove at home so shoulder 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.200
 how not to be washed at all 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.880
 citric acid I poured the term 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 a little paint and now 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.340
 we have ready-made bowls with taps 1 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.130
 rougher any more blues he even 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.580
 mixing wonder for liquid for 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.850
 give the will shade well well now 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.800
 proceed directly to the staining 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.800
 take a strand of hair 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.460
 then take the foil we put here more precisely 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.259
 our 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.259
 went to the tip of the foil and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:13.780
 we take paint we start to flash ours 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:16.890
 I need to beat the tip in Moscow 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.780
 so all not to foam and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.780
 not very fast extra cube 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.730
 people 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.730
 and when 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.690
 and me 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.360
 create a website 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.590
 they are ready to wait 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.900
 give in principle you need 30-40 but if u 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.240
 somewhere at your fingertips 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.450
 super whether your lamp it will reduce 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.450
 time waited up to 10 minutes so dare 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.230
 after you wait for the right 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.050
 amount of time from my all this 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.410
 cool water that's what happened 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.100
 tips in the absence of an end result 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:42.600
 half strands of this turquoise color 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.600
 half more blue
