the least at this point about Matt Flynn
I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.390> he's<00:01:54.540> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.869> unassuming<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.649> think

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I think he's kind of unassuming I think

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.920 
I think he's kind of unassuming I think
he's<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> those<00:01:56.549> guys<00:01:56.820> who

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
he's just kind of one of those guys who

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
he's just kind of one of those guys who

physically doesn't while you he's not 65

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
physically doesn't while you he's not 65
he's<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> shade<00:02:00.149> over<00:02:00.390> 62<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.409> he's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
he's just a shade over 62 I think he's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
he's just a shade over 62 I think he's
not<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> big<00:02:02.460> build<00:02:02.820> guy<00:02:03.090> he's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.600> guy<00:02:03.840> who's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
not a big build guy he's not a guy who's

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
you with blazing speed he doesn't have

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.719 
you with blazing speed he doesn't have
the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

zip it aloft it up there like we said to
saw<00:02:26.549> him<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:26.989> against<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> Detroit<00:02:28.530> Lions

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
when he was with the Packers so I think

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.699 
when he was with the Packers so I think
he's<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.510> one<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> those<00:02:30.900> guys<00:02:31.110> who<00:02:31.170> doesn't

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
with arm strength or speed but just as

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.250 
with arm strength or speed but just as
accurate<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:36.989> we've<00:02:37.140> heard

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
accurate and that's what we've heard

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.589 
accurate and that's what we've heard
about<00:02:37.410> him<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:37.829> I<00:02:38.159> lean<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.150> toward<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
about him so I I lean more toward that

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.970 
about him so I I lean more toward that

he's going to be the starter I know I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.759 
he's going to be the starter I know I
don't<00:02:51.329> care<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> being<00:02:52.019> said<00:02:52.290> unless<00:02:52.590> he

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
don't care what is being said unless he

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.369 
don't care what is being said unless he
falls<00:02:53.010> flat<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.310> his<00:02:53.519> face<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.780> yeah<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.200> think

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
falls flat on his face and yeah I think

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.990 
falls flat on his face and yeah I think
he's<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> started<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.069> think<00:02:56.519> he<00:02:56.579> will<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.819> too

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
he's it started I think he will be too

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.319 
he's it started I think he will be too
and<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.840> other<00:02:57.989> thing<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.349> him<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.799> it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
and the other thing with him is that it

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.000 
and the other thing with him is that it
he<00:03:00.329> can<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:00.720> together<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.200> tremendous

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
he can put together a tremendous

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.119 
he can put together a tremendous
2-minute<00:03:02.819> drill<00:03:03.349> type<00:03:04.349> drive<00:03:04.650> late<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
2-minute drill type drive late in the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.410 
2-minute drill type drive late in the
game<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.489> fourth<00:03:05.760> quarter<00:03:05.940> which<00:03:06.209> was

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
game in the fourth quarter which was

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.720 
game in the fourth quarter which was
Tavares<00:03:07.379> ultimate<00:03:07.769> downfall<00:03:07.980> last<00:03:08.459> year<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
Tavares ultimate downfall last year I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.819 
Tavares ultimate downfall last year I
think<00:03:08.790> was<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> inability<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:10.140> succeed<00:03:10.620> late

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
think was the inability to succeed late

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.069 
think was the inability to succeed late
in<00:03:10.950> games<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.519> fourth<00:03:11.730> quarter<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.930> lot

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
in games in the fourth quarter and a lot

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.300 
in games in the fourth quarter and a lot
of<00:03:13.109> times<00:03:13.349> those<00:03:13.500> dry<00:03:13.739> they<00:03:13.919> aren't<00:03:14.130> very

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
of times those dry they aren't very

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.430 
of times those dry they aren't very
flashy<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.239> aren't<00:03:15.389> very<00:03:15.630> there's<00:03:16.319> not

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.780 
flashy and they aren't very there's not
a<00:03:16.470> lot<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.650> sizzle<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> them<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.669> is<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
a lot of sizzle to them because it is a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.370 
a lot of sizzle to them because it is a
lot<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.060> us<00:03:18.180> check<00:03:18.389> down<00:03:18.569> throws<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.139> skipped

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
lot of us check down throws and skipped

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
just do what it takes may not be flashy

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
just do what it takes may not be flashy
