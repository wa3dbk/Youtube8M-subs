00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 today it is essential to do this in your dreams 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.950
 this technique is done with water and it is called 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.110
 warm tree and it is not simple it depends 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.059
 a lot of having the right glazes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 because they have to open good all 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 the glazes serve to do this the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.949
 of polis me tubes are excellent for 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.510
 do keep or perfect these open 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.730
 how shine the cares have to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.060
 shake very well before using them I'll 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 use three shades of the same brand of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.750
 white and and this blue tone all unions 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.579
 until the blue we must to need a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 small glass with water can be a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.320
 stick but I'm going to use a pointer 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 like I'm more towards a little ball 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.020
 cotton to clean this mess a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.539
 cotonete to clean this disaster more 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.329
 and so they are very meticulous as a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 brush to clean the little bank and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.120
 obviously a little bit of acetone we're going to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 start both with these colors or as 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
 those that are with a layer of white 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.140
 because the enamel is going to be very 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 delgadito in the water on the surface 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.250
 of water in you if we do not put white not 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.560
 you will notice the colors so strong 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 as they should then let's start 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 a white layer of this and we're going to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 filling the glass with habitat is a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 little dirty because I have already used several 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.280
 times but the water is clean is this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 is time is the key I've heard 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 who use bottled water but the truth 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.689
 always use the key and until now 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 for what I have done, it has worked for me 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.500
 then we are going to open all the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.540
 glazes to have them ready already what 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.780
 I'm going to do is put a drop of enamel 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.270
 in the center of the water 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 and expect it to open medium fast 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 I will be doing the same in the center 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 where I go alternating all colors 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 then with the help of the pointer I will 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.180
 make a kind of petals like 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 we are doing here I do not need to do 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.670
 all the surface is enough to take out 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.670
 some petals 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.600
 and I'm going to clean the pointer every time 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.600
 need in a cotton with acetone 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.620
 and it's enough for me then I'll choose where 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.620
 more I like how the petals were 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.240
 I liked it is where I'm going to immerse myself 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.020
 buoy submerge it looking down and 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.020
 quickly 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.540
 I'm going to leave it inside and I'm going to blow 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.900
 the surface to dry all that excess 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.920
 of enamel that remained 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.349
 which I will remove with the pointer 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.750
 because to get my no longer ruin me the 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.370
 design that I already want the now I'm going to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.799
 take 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.200
 and it 's on the petals that we're going to use 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.280
 the cotton ball and let's clean 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.700
 all the excess 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.310
 and this on the fingers without getting too close 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.290
 to the nail but the parts closest to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.560
 the nail we will occupy the cotonete with the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.560
 acetone 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.670
 You can use a wet brush 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.670
 olive to clean all the edges 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.970
 The last step is to add top coat and 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.250
 Wet your hands because surely 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.980
 there will be recipes of so much acetone that 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.810
 we use to clean and if you are if you go to 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.879
 use these same enamels remember 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.819
 a download the light source is 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.590
 the natural or artificial between 1 and 5 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.569
 minutes to enjoy the brightness in the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.760
 darkness and that's all for this 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.090
 tutorial I hope you liked it bye 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.090
 bye 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.350
 they made me do this in their 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 no dream is very simple indeed I have not 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.290
 fact is not at all simple in fact it is 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.790
 very difficult too 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.790
 it's a disaster I know
