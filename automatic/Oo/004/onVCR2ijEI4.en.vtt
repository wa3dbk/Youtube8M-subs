most open water students finished with a
bitter<00:00:25.289> swell<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> catch<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> good<00:00:26.609> wave

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
bitter swell and to catch a good wave

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
bitter swell and to catch a good wave
you<00:00:27.449> need<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.900> six<00:00:28.230> feet<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you need to have six feet to get on it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.040 
you need to have six feet to get on it
then<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.880> stay<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> wave<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.840> gets

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
then just stay on that wave when it gets

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020 
then just stay on that wave when it gets
really<00:00:31.320> small<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.430> put<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.820> head<00:00:33.000> down

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
really small just put your head down

really small just put your head down
hold<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> streamline<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.260> six<00:00:34.530> feet<00:00:34.680> kick<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
hold a streamline and six feet kick and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
hold a streamline and six feet kick and
that'll<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> beach<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that'll get you right to the beach you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.060 
that'll get you right to the beach you
can<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.770> beat<00:00:37.950> your

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
can just get up and beat your

can just get up and beat your
competitors<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> beach<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.450> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
competitors on the beach if you can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
competitors on the beach if you can
finish<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.989> white<00:00:40.200> race<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> wave

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
finish your white race with a wave

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
finish your white race with a wave
you'll<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.149> miles<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> your

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you'll be miles and kind of your

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
you'll be miles and kind of your
competitors<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.410> you'll<00:00:43.590> shave<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> huge

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
competitors and you'll shave a huge

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
competitors and you'll shave a huge
amount<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:44.910> race<00:00:45.090> waves<00:00:45.480> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
amount of time off your race waves are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
amount of time off your race waves are
much<00:00:45.840> faster<00:00:46.079> than<00:00:46.379> swimming<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> key<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
much faster than swimming so the key is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
much faster than swimming so the key is
I<00:00:47.879> guess<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> main<00:00:48.899> key<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.140> probably<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> keep

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
I guess the main key is probably to keep

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
I guess the main key is probably to keep
your<00:00:49.829> head<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.250> increase<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.390> kick<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
your head down increase your kick and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
your head down increase your kick and
probably<00:00:52.110> keep<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.379> arms<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.219> hands<00:00:53.399> out

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
probably keep your arms out or hands out

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
probably keep your arms out or hands out
in<00:00:53.640> front<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.030> planing<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.379> head

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
in front of you just planing so head

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
in front of you just planing so head
down<00:00:55.890> kicking<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.180> soon<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> feel<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
down kicking as soon as you feel that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
down kicking as soon as you feel that
way<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:57.930> high<00:00:58.230> G<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.219> might<00:00:59.340> not

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
way for high G you know you might not

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.619 
way for high G you know you might not
catch<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.510> you'll

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
catch it all the way in but you'll

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.819 
catch it all the way in but you'll
probably<00:01:00.690> catch<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> much<00:01:01.289> further<00:01:01.500> than<00:01:01.739> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
probably catch it much further than your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.310 
probably catch it much further than your
competitors<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.480> sometimes<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
competitors so that sometimes if you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
competitors so that sometimes if you
feel<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.890> being<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.400> front<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.850> body

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
feel you're being in front of your body

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
feel you're being in front of your body
or<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.479> chest<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> being<00:01:07.200> picked<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.920> by<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
or your chest is being picked up by the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.880 
or your chest is being picked up by the
wave<00:01:08.670> behind<00:01:09.170> sometimes<00:01:10.170> that's<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
wave behind sometimes that's when you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
wave behind sometimes that's when you
need<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.390> moving<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.930> get

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
need to to get to get moving and get

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120 
need to to get to get moving and get
maybe<00:01:13.890> pick<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.369> stroke<00:01:14.640> rate<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:15.000> slightly

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
maybe pick your stroke rate up slightly

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
maybe pick your stroke rate up slightly
and<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.460> kick<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.600> get

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and get your kick up as well to get

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
and get your kick up as well to get
pushed<00:01:19.080> forward<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:20.729> when

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
pushed forward and then when you're when

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
pushed forward and then when you're when
you<00:01:21.180> feel<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> bet<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> drop<00:01:22.650> down<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you feel you you bet you drop down to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.910 
you feel you you bet you drop down to
the<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.850> between<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.689> lower<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> wave

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the in between the lower bit of the wave

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
the in between the lower bit of the wave
that's<00:01:26.640> where<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.420> relax<00:01:27.689> for

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's where you can just relax for

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
that's where you can just relax for
maybe<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:28.530> strokes<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.250> pick

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
maybe one or two strokes and then pick

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.200 
maybe one or two strokes and then pick
it<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.700> again

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it up again

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
it up again
when<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> feel<00:01:30.900> yourself<00:01:31.049> being<00:01:31.320> picked<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
when you feel yourself being picked up

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710 
when you feel yourself being picked up

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
picked up put in a six bit kick then

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
picked up put in a six bit kick then
just<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> wave<00:01:37.650> hold<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.220> streamline

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
just get on that wave hold a streamline

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
just get on that wave hold a streamline
take<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.689> stroke<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.740> breathe<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.310> then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
take your stroke to breathe but then

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
take your stroke to breathe but then
hold<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> streamline<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.689> keep<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the stand beneath you get off and run

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
the stand beneath you get off and run
you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.540> pick<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.840> time<00:01:49.049> even<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> small<00:01:49.890> swell

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you can pick up time even in small swell
