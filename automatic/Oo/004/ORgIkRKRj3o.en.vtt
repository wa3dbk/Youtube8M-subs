00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
watching guys and let's get straight

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
watching guys and let's get straight
into<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.800> basically<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.880> trip<00:00:18.119> wire

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
into it so basically to make a trip wire

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.599 
into it so basically to make a trip wire
trap<00:00:18.980> initially<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.130> need<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.460> make

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
trap initially you need to make

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.040 
trap initially you need to make
something<00:00:20.939> looks<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.810> I'm

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
something looks to be like this I'm

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.540 
something looks to be like this I'm
gonna<00:00:22.230> put<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.590> gloss<00:00:22.890> still<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.279> make

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
gonna put some gloss still down to make

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
gonna put some gloss still down to make
it<00:00:23.670> easier<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.170> do

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it easier to see you don't have to do

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
it easier to see you don't have to do
that<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.910> put<00:00:27.090> down<00:00:27.240> two

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that obviously and you put down two

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
that obviously and you put down two
blocks<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> play<00:00:28.590> strip<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.130> your

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
blocks and then you play strip for your

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
blocks and then you play strip for your
hooks<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.760> either<00:00:30.179> side<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.019> where<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.890> want

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
hooks on either side of where you want

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
hooks on either side of where you want
to<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> trap<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> simply<00:00:33.360> put

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
to make a trap and then you simply put

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.350 
to make a trap and then you simply put
strings<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> between<00:00:34.760> when<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> put<00:00:36.030> string

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
strings in between when you put string

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.650 
strings in between when you put string
in<00:00:36.510> between<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:37.020> activates<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.770> trap<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.660> as

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
in between it activates the trap and as

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.770 
in between it activates the trap and as
you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.950> clicks<00:00:41.640> every<00:00:42.149> time<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.600> go

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
you can see it clicks every time you go

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 
you can see it clicks every time you go
through<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> trap<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
through the trap from then on and that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
through the trap from then on and that
means<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.180> trip<00:00:45.420> wire<00:00:45.570> has<00:00:45.780> been<00:00:45.950> like

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
means that your trip wire has been like

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.619 
means that your trip wire has been like
activated<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> do

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
activated and then you need to do

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
activated and then you need to do
redstone<00:00:49.110> wiring<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:50.370> make<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.760> trap<00:00:51.030> work

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
redstone wiring to make your trap work

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
redstone wiring to make your trap work
so<00:00:51.989> I've<00:00:52.170> made<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> station<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so I've made this station here to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
so I've made this station here to
demonstrate<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> works<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> I've<00:00:56.010> simply

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
demonstrate how it works and I've simply

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
demonstrate how it works and I've simply
just<00:00:56.489> put<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:56.789> redstone<00:00:57.000> wire<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:58.140> across

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
just put some redstone wire going across

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.939 
just put some redstone wire going across
to<00:00:58.469> each<00:00:58.770> end<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> when<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> tripped<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> wire

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
to each end and when I tripped the wire

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
to each end and when I tripped the wire
it<00:01:01.949> activates<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> current<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.809> good

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it activates the current so this is good

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
it activates the current so this is good
for<00:01:04.320> making<00:01:04.439> traps<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.129> people<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
for making traps for people you know I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.899 
for making traps for people you know I
dispenser<00:01:06.570> traps<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.170> TNT<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
dispenser traps are TNT and this is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.480 
dispenser traps are TNT and this is
where<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.420> station<00:01:10.110> comes<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.369> effect

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
where this station comes into effect

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.109 
where this station comes into effect
I've<00:01:12.030> basically<00:01:12.390> placed<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.350> single<00:01:14.310> TNT<00:01:14.790> down

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
I've basically placed a single TNT down

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.179 
I've basically placed a single TNT down
here<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> cover<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
here and I'm going to cover it up and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
here and I'm going to cover it up and
I'm<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> run<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.560> redstone<00:01:19.560> across

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I'm going to run some redstone across

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
I'm going to run some redstone across
obviously<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> Redstone<00:01:22.200> more

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
obviously you can make the Redstone more

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
obviously you can make the Redstone more
discreet<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.460> people<00:01:23.759> can't<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> but

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
discreet so that people can't see it but

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
discreet so that people can't see it but
this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.170> demonstration<00:01:25.280> purposes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this is just for demonstration purposes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is just for demonstration purposes
so<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> run<00:01:26.729> through<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.979> right

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so I run through it and then all right

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
so I run through it and then all right
now<00:01:29.400> something's<00:01:30.119> happening<00:01:30.750> ah<00:01:31.579> beng<00:01:32.990> yeah

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
now something's happening ah beng yeah

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
now something's happening ah beng yeah
not<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> could<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
not you could like do that people it's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
not you could like do that people it's
also<00:01:36.180> possible<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.140> discreet<00:01:37.740> traps

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
also possible to make discreet traps

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
also possible to make discreet traps
such<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.119> getting<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.900> wire<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
such as getting some wire and just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
such as getting some wire and just
simply<00:01:41.460> running<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> straight<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.509> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
simply running it straight down so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350
