00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this you want to connect it with the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.290 
this you want to connect it with the
dispensers<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.880> second<00:00:33.420> guys

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
dispensers and so on so just second guys

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
dispensers and so on so just second guys
so<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.690> 5<00:00:36.989> different<00:00:37.910> types<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so let's make 5 different types of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.950 
so let's make 5 different types of
fireworks<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.559> blow<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> same

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
fireworks are gonna blow up at the same

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
fireworks are gonna blow up at the same
time<00:00:43.290> which<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.980> cool<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> can

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
time which is really cool and you can

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
time which is really cool and you can
use<00:00:45.450> redstone<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.590> go

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
use redstone and you can actually go

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
use redstone and you can actually go
further<00:00:47.039> away<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> remembered<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
further away but I remembered that I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
further away but I remembered that I
think<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.920> might<00:00:50.160> need<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.469> repeaters<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.940> if

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
think I might need that repeaters but if

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
think I might need that repeaters but if
you<00:00:54.360> haven't<00:00:54.539> seen<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.809> last<00:00:54.840> episode<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you haven't seen my last episode how to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.060 
you haven't seen my last episode how to
make<00:00:55.980> fireworks<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.850> explain<00:00:57.949> better<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
make fireworks where I explain better I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.990 
make fireworks where I explain better I
guess<00:00:59.340> then<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.660> check<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
guess then you can go check it out so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
guess then you can go check it out so
yeah<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.080> material<00:01:04.350> and

let's make eight of these and there we

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:32.280 
let's make eight of these and there we
go<00:01:19.189> then<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.729> eight<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.600> these

how<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> works<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.959> fuck<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.110> logic<00:03:42.110> so

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:04.550 

some<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.680> these<00:03:55.790> and<00:04:00.080> some<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.140> these<00:04:03.200> ok<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.260> we

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
some of these and some of these ok so we

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.970 
some of these and some of these ok so we
have<00:04:04.680> 1<00:04:04.920> 2<00:04:06.350> want<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:08.360> 4<00:04:09.360> different<00:04:09.900> ones<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.530> we

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
have 1 2 want to 4 different ones so we

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.670 
have 1 2 want to 4 different ones so we
can<00:04:11.130> just<00:04:11.280> take<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:11.700> out<00:04:11.940> here<00:04:18.410> let's<00:04:19.410> see<00:04:19.560> if

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
can just take this out here let's see if

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.060 
can just take this out here let's see if
all<00:04:19.919> connects<00:04:20.430> by<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.299> lever<00:04:24.500> yes<00:04:25.500> everything

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
all connects by the lever yes everything

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.420 
all connects by the lever yes everything
works<00:04:26.310> out<00:04:26.490> perfect<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.510> let's<00:04:28.470> put<00:04:28.740> them<00:04:28.919> in

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
works out perfect so let's put them in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.150 
works out perfect so let's put them in
here<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:32.090> this

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
here like this

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
far away the redstone but then you need

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.050 
far away the redstone but then you need
repeaters<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:04.050> stuff<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.440> so

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
repeaters and stuff like this so

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.100 
repeaters and stuff like this so
hopefully<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.300> guys<00:05:07.390> enjoyed<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.900> or
