00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.410
 I would like to start the video with a question 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.560
 which then you all have at least once 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 asked both here and in private but 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.040
 how started your friendship with fun 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.179
 well if you really want to know we must 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 far February 2014 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 looking through the channel information 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.519
 of fans upton 371 I find the channel of his 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170
 graphic mac then as i needed to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.279
 a graphic for my channel decided to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.529
 contact me on skype 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.920
 having agreed to work i 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 Greeks and my channel and pleased 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 being the upton fan graphic he told me 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.110
 that he would surely have spoken to her 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.800
 since it does not is one of my favorites 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600

 written my channel and note how many 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.730
 subscribers had at the time much less than 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 now, however, I was happy that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.489
 he had seen my channel but the day 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.960

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 fifty questions obviously not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 I can answer everyone else, otherwise he leaves 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.619
 a three-day video so I will try 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 to answer the largest number of 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.210
 questions and let's start without stopping 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 I wanted to say hello to Loris first 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.259
 facebook uploaded me to greet him in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 video 15 or loris and now we can 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.860
 really starting the first question ce 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 my bad cousin is doing that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 from the score side of youtube ximena 89 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 he asks us that ben axa there is one 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 big thanks 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.399
 I wanted to ask you if you follow some 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.119
 youtuber then mainly follows 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.799
 fan upton breaking italy exact e 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.180
 some other channel of mine 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.229
 friend or some other channel 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 interesting deco class duff 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.159
 does that csav as usual does the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 great videos and if a myth thanks but the 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.700
 my questions are two when it reaches 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.019
 in a certain number of members 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.480
 will think of doing special facts 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.769
 on purpose and of course yes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.260
 for the ten thousand members, I will find a 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.750
 special video to take you and there is 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.950
 another question is what would you think if 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.110
 He wanted to spread on youtube 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.540
 using tied game capture hd e 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.980
 just buying a good microphone 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 a little money to take it in since 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.360
 capture hd while the microphone when 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.319
 you will probably see this video already 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.269
 in transit 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.920
 I bought a samsung puts that one now 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.110
 of the microphones that use several 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 youtuber loris asks us how it is 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.560
 came the passion of making videos I had 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.420
 already answered this question in a 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.829
 other faq anyway is since I was a little 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.480
 smaller than I enjoyed making i 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.000
 video with movie maker then upload them on 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.549
 everything started as a gamer from youtube 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.959
 he asks, I know you willings you think 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.700
 to reach its large share of 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.340
 subscribers 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.569
 I think so diego cilia asks but you az 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.090
 willing seven friends or even 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.400
 fellow villagers but you have it with willy today 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.280
 is already the second question 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.959
 oh well anyway the villagers amicis no 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 he lives in Tuscany while I live in Rome 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.120
 then he asks us what the game advises between 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.260
 far cry 4 assassin's creed ii a vo the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.989
 crew 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.630
 I personally would choose farquhar i 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.819
 four yes fly asks you which one is yours 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.230
 favorite sports sport that you yourself have 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.660
 I practiced basketball and swimming 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.880
 my favorite for now is basketball 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.750
 I then asks the splits that region 6 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.340
 lazio 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.019
 what do you think of those youtuber that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.599
 they pay sponsorship houses 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.040
 to become famous 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.380
 obviously they can't do it alone and 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.639
 they need external help and then for 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.290
 last question give us all 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.000
 touring capture information where 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.379
 you bought it against the wages you had 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.690
 then mine is an aperi miles than in 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.280
 hd capture bought on amazon year 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.709
 last hundred euros 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.359
 probably now it will cost less matteo 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.030
 volandri asks sooner or later will change the 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.949
 type of video on the channel yes the channel 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.389
 will always remain focused on gta but in 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.069
 future if I find some game that me 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.290
 like I could take it here on the canal 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.849
 nannini so asks I noticed that the pc 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.919
 you like most of the consoles then 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.060
 will buy igt and 5 for pc or ci 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.280
 will bring the other serious on PC 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.470
 I will definitely buy GTA 5 for PC 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.260
 especially because there will be a film maker 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.150
 and regarding the 37 on pc we will see 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.300
 antonio licata ask falcone was the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.850
 first game you played maybe 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.700

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.950
 yellow you gozo asks exan we will ai 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.870
 video with youtuber smaller than you 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.280
 yes of course I don't see what's wrong with 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.500
 make a video like youtube er more 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.330
 small of me anyway if one is good is 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.120
 good so the members don't count 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.210
 tl gita chievo asks is there an ex or better 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 to say xsi better in this context 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.020
 apart from the jokes I wanted to tell you that if 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.479
 a big thank you anyway for the fax 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.370
 need for the question so here is when 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.500
 go to you tube every day always sees 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.389
 more subscribers how you feel 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.490

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.040
 go up it makes me understand that I am succeeding 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.540
 in what I'm doing and always 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.580
 more people appreciate the content they 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.720
 then load on the channel all this 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.760
 can only make me that pleasure 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.190
 a greeting to chievo and we move on to 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.169
 next question to core gaming asks 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.510
 why buy original games ie one 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.490
 you can't change it theoretically 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.220
 I could do it but I don't see the need 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.870
 much I buy games I rarely choose with 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.570
 care and play and I have to buy too 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.800
 because I don't like many genres now 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.479
 let's move on to the last questions of this 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.010
 episode that I will put together 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.560
 because they are similar 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.830
 then ball downs ciro gt and glitch team 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.150

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.350

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.289

 or at least I won't do it now and I don't know 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.900
 I don't know which one to advise you depends on 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.340
 exclusive that the two consoles have from 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.860
 offer and the ones you like best 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.039
 raffaele leandro asks you why 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.760
 has decided to call you qseven 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.340
 practically that name 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.470
 dates back to a long time ago when I was older 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.810
 little one I had seen a similar name not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.760
 I remember where I was then playing and 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.330
 online games like a hostel things 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.270
 similar 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.030
 those things I used to use that name 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.409
 but it's stuff from me several years ago 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.159
