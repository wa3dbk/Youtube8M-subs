00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
this video cynical because why is my

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.710 
this video cynical because why is my
water<00:02:42.900> orange<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.820> all<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> did<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.510> add

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
water orange and like all I did was add

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.040 
water orange and like all I did was add
conditioner<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> I've<00:02:46.830> seen<00:02:46.860> process<00:02:48.050> did

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
conditioner to it I've seen process did

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.810 
conditioner to it I've seen process did
the<00:02:49.200> same<00:02:49.410> type<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.770> process<00:02:50.190> system<00:02:50.670> our

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the same type of process system our

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.500 
the same type of process system our
junior<00:02:51.240> year<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.400> my<00:02:53.400> water<00:02:53.640> wasn't<00:02:53.970> orange

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
junior year and my water wasn't orange

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.330 
junior year and my water wasn't orange
it<00:02:54.660> was<00:02:54.810> maybe<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> little<00:02:55.950> foggy

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it was maybe it was like a little foggy

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.220 
it was maybe it was like a little foggy
I<00:02:56.880> guess<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.570> was<00:02:57.690> because<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
I guess that was because of the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
I guess that was because of the
conditioner<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.160> was<00:02:59.310> no<00:02:59.520> color<00:02:59.880> or<00:03:00.330> no

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
conditioner but it was no color or no

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.870 
conditioner but it was no color or no
type<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.080> residue<00:03:01.740> or<00:03:01.920> whatever<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.640> water

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880
