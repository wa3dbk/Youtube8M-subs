00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello everyone today we will do 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:15.049
 rack for the light from this rubbish here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:20.430
 for whom trash and for whom it is fittings for 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:26.660
 polypropylene pipe first do 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.660
 base cut three pieces of 20 cm 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:44.370
 25 on the dynamo make the length of the whole world 25 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:48.659
 you even basically have a tee left 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 such a trim for the same connect it 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:58.470
 with the mast right away this video I 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 spied how to do it but adding 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.170
 design your changes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 Here is such a detail for those 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340
 who buy new tees tomi new 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.729
 fitting 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 solder couplings do not need all we collect further 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.290
 so we connected 30 centimeter 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 cut with our tee and here here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.640
 soldered here is such a 90 angle now with this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.230
 side solder 20-centimeter cut 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 so we soldered 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.530
 now this piece is also 20 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 centimeters solder here so a corner of them 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.810
 there must be two things done now 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.370
 to tee 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.680
 soldering in the same way both did 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.960
 such a thing all gathered together now 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.570
 let's take our foundation 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.060
 how is the bedroom like this? 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.580
 the design turned out 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.320
 this will be the base of our tripod for 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.360
 light that is 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.790
 here now solder a layer like this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.290
 small stands we got that is clear 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.470
 this is the base this is the rack itself 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.780
 now i'm lengthening up to two meters 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.400
 which further I will tell how to fix 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:21.050
 spotlight on I did the following here 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.600
 such a searchlight 150 wadded means took 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.190
 two mounts on this twenty fifth 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.540
 pipe 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.670
 twisted them together with bolts and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.580
 then screwed it to the spotlight 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.180
 here is wrapped with tape to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.810
 these brackets didnâ€™t slid much on 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.230
 this pipe further everything just take 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.550
 spotlight come to our here this 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.209
 stand remove it here and so found 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.720
 nod and everything 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:59.410
 twist-twirl 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.410
 raise above the pipe height of 2 meters 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.870
 the design is so much from someone I 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.070
 Well, due to the wide stand is not at all 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.200
 will not become and now I will tell and I will show 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.970
 how did the first stand look for 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.260
 Sveta 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.060
 the first construction looked like this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:24.530
 rather, it looks like this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.670
 there is a base here made on four 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.040
 legs and made of 20 pipe in what 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.170
 there was a mistake that is a construction 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.400
 turned out pretty shaky due to 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.150
 the fact that the turbo twists among themselves 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.709
 I had to solder in the evening it did in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.910
 the store did not have time to go 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:50.690
 redo it all that is soldered here 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.570
 coupling 20 was not pieces of 20 minutes 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.220
 five pieces soldered it turned out a little 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.360
 tougher 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.300
 and mount to this rack looks like this 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.070
 so that is, but the second pipe to it 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.890
 bolted through the same bolts 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.910
 brackets 25 pipe and here is such 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.970
 transition construction tees and 2 couplings 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.609
 bolted spotlight that is why it 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.760
 did because worried that 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.030
 the searchlight will be very hot and here 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.700
 here are the brackets bracket to pipe 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.400
 can melt and fall out just well I 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.560
 conducted a test that is, he stood where 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 then 40 minutes probably nothing is included 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.050
 heated nothing fell that is like 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.240
 ok but will experience this this 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:47.860
 the design that is it is regulated here 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.730
 so here it is 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.400
 brackets and bear hare on this one 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:58.730
 the pipe, that is, can be raised too 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.680
 the same level of up to two meters here well 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:06.280
 if the disadvantage of this design is 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.280
 that below this level somewhere meter 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:14.660
 somewhere meter thirty probably meter forty 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 I will not lower because rests 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.890
 the tube in the spotlight itself will all be 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.610
 test 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.610
 both designs thank you all for your attention 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.610
 until
