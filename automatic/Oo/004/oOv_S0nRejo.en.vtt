 "Erythritol can be a sweet antioxidant" 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.501
 The only non-toxic, non-caloric or low-calorie sweetener may be erythritol. 

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.602
 It was only available in Japan for some time. 

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:17.202
 But now it is available everywhere. 

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.872
 It occurs naturally in pears and grape. 

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.072
 However, it is industrially obtained by yeast. 

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:23.050
 Erythritol does not cause caries 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.031
 and has never been involved in a case of fibromyalgia, premature birth, 

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:33.721
 headache, hypertension, brain disorders or platelet disorders. 

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.470
 I spoke in my previous videos 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.131
 that erythritol is harmless. 

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:41.721
 However, new knowledge suggests that I may have to change my mind. 

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.442
 Now it seems that it may even be beneficial. 

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:48.371
 Not only will it serve as a "low calorie, harmless and bulky tooth," 

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.912
 erythritol may also be a "sweet antioxidant." 

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.720
 Here we see a protective effect - increasing with erythritol - 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.840
 against oxidative damage 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.821
 red blood cells. 

00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.051
 The antioxidant capacity has been decided by scientists to 

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.762
 that erythritol looks structurally like mannitol 

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.910
 known antioxidant. 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.001
 The problem with mannitol and others 

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.100
 polyols (such as xylitol and sorbitol) are 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.250
 that our body does not absorb them and therefore they can 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.753
 cause digestive problems in the colon. 

00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:22.891
 â€œSafety studies suggest that erythritol is well tolerated 

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.154
 and shows no signs of toxicity. 

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:28.239
 It is therefore a great substitute for sugar 

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.912
 for example, for people with diabetes, " 

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:31.692
 it can replace ordinary sugar in food 

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:34.941
 and at the same time it might even help reduce the formation of free radicals in the body. 

00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.501
 "Both of these abilities are expected to reduce entry and deterioration 

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:44.483
 painful and life-threatening diabetes-related complications. "
