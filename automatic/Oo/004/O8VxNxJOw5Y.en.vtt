00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.660 
feet of water in a big mouse plant
basically<00:02:12.160> was<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.519> was<00:02:12.730> fishing<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.959> was

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
the fluctuation in this the lake here is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.180 
the fluctuation in this the lake here is
about<00:02:19.000> seven<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.599> eight<00:02:19.660> feet<00:02:20.160> through<00:02:21.160> the

about seven or eight feet through the
year<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.989> mouse<00:02:23.200> world<00:02:23.650> will<00:02:24.519> grow

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
year in the the mouse world will grow

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
year in the the mouse world will grow
well<00:02:25.780> does<00:02:25.989> not<00:02:26.200> grow<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.620> less<00:02:26.830> than<00:02:27.069> seven

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.620 
feet of water and basically this time of
year<00:02:30.099> it's<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.400> good<00:02:30.610> pattern<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.299> right<00:02:31.510> on

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
year it's a good pattern to get right on

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.860 
year it's a good pattern to get right on

okay<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.050> would<00:03:41.260> know<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.830> fish

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
okay so you would know that the fish

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.490 
okay so you would know that the fish
from<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.060> marker<00:03:43.540> buoy<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.080> fish<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.410> you

from this marker buoy the fish that you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.900 
from this marker buoy the fish that you
caught<00:03:44.740> was<00:03:44.950> right<00:03:45.130> out<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.430> here<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.819> you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
caught was right out in here and you

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.420 
caught was right out in here and you
would<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.270> do<00:03:46.390> what<00:03:46.569> well<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.290> would<00:03:47.650> continue

to fish the crank bait in that area for

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.100 
to fish the crank bait in that area for
probably<00:03:51.280> 15<00:03:51.670> or<00:03:51.790> 20<00:03:52.090> cast<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.600> then<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.780> picked

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
probably 15 or 20 cast and then I picked
