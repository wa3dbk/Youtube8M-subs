00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Good as we are talking from the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 last week from next year 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 cars manufactured in Brazil with a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.010
 2014 model will have security items 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.889
 mandatory as air bag and abs today we 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.900
 Let's talk about the abs brake is the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 ideal maintenance for this 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 brakes that prevents wheel locking 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 who talks about it with us is the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.269
 gentoo after sales manager today a bs 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 as well as air bag required 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.880
 as of 2014 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 but how exactly does this work? 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.130
 system to ensure this safety 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.800
 brakes on locking wheels that abs is 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 exactly the braking system that goes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.770
 act when you wash the vehicle in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 braking abrupt so it will only trigger 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.960
 when you really need the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
 locking of the vehicle that he knows 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780
 oss 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.610
 the system is running so that no 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.800
 brake the wheels it has components 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 special for this does not work has a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 gps system it will catch it goes 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 calculate the speed of the waves 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 in relation to the speed of the vehicle 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 so it goes if it has a wheel that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.229
 he is working with less 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 speed the other wheel it goes 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.250
 to know he had the system he is 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.060
 realizing that this wheel to think 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.270
 then it will cycle 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 release the oil flow to this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 wheel with that accompanies the same 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 speed of the other waves so that the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.659
 vehicle has no side plate 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 driving and driving 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.189
 get out of the driver's ideal condition 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.680
 say the driver has to drive 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.829
 your car with an abs brakes system and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.869
 there the red light or panel 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.640
 saying that there are problems with Messi as 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.250
 is that it was functional cmp 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 when the fault light switches on 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 pressed on the panel it is indicating 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.329
 that has a problem in the system then 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.790
 the vehicle will not lose the braking 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.259
 then it will get a normal brake 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 mechanical brake it will not have to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.060
 Brake efficiency with the head when 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.509
 a customer when you are driving 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.799
 your car you brake 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.829
 requiring emergency braking. 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.570
 car that has abs you feel the noise and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.310
 They're peter whistling that's not a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.290
 problem is the system acting 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.720
 now a genius to analyze how the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.209
 driver should take care of your ps3 system 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.069
 with respect to the exchange of fluid at 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.310
 importance of being strict at this point 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.130
 the gps system it has a central 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 that makes this reading of the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.480
 sensors but also it has a body of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.870
 valve as we call them. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.540
 valves her work one makes a one 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.170
 work with each other with oil so they are 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.769
 through the oil of the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.950
 brake 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.739
 then this oil he has for checking 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.180
 period is ideal for exchange so that not one 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.860
 I promise the system 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.750
 the ideal period of exchange depends on the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 model depends on the manufacturer 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.739
 depends on the manufacturer but every two 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 years is a good time with who has to 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.400
 pass whenever changing this bus already 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.590
 I was thankful for the collaboration 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.870
 again so abs system 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.910
 required from 2014 cars 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.190
 can 2014 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 it is important to check the brake fluid 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.400
 so that the system bf can protect it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.400
 how it was designed
