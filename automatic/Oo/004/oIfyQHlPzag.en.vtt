you see I got some just some random
lights<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> record<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.829> cue<00:00:50.070> come

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
lights up there now to record a cue come

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
lights up there now to record a cue come
down<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.909> row<00:00:51.179> of<00:00:51.239> bump<00:00:51.480> buttons<00:00:51.780> each

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
down to this row of bump buttons each

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
down to this row of bump buttons each
bump<00:00:52.499> final<00:00:53.089> will<00:00:54.089> correlate<00:00:54.659> to<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.929> slider

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bump final will correlate to the slider

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.919 
bump final will correlate to the slider
above<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.749> put

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
above it and so let's say we want to put

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.809 
above it and so let's say we want to put
all<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.229> lights<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.100> slider<00:00:59.460> so

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
all these lights into this one slider so

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.020 
all these lights into this one slider so
that<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.210> cue<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.839> click<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> bump<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
that that cue be here click the bump on

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.190 
that that cue be here click the bump on
sometimes<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.089> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.269> do<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> twice<00:01:03.629> if

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.200 
sometimes you have to do it twice if

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.450 
sometimes you have to do it twice if
there's<00:01:04.590> no<00:01:04.860> light<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
one slider the reason I said it should

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.510 
one slider the reason I said it should
be<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.550> page<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.400> up

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 
be in page one is because you can do up
to<00:01:53.610> 48<00:01:54.180> different<00:01:54.540> cues<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.220> be<00:01:56.250> an

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to 48 different cues so this could be an

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
to 48 different cues so this could be an
entire<00:01:56.790> row<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.150> separate<00:01:57.540> queues<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.050> then

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
entire row of separate queues and then

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130 
entire row of separate queues and then
if<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:58.530> switch<00:01:58.950> over<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.220> page<00:01:59.520> 2<00:01:59.910> by<00:02:00.660> clicking

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
if you switch over to page 2 by clicking

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.640 
if you switch over to page 2 by clicking
on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.920> arrows<00:02:02.220> until<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.760> there<00:02:03.650> see

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
on the arrows until it's right there see

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.310 
on the arrows until it's right there see
your<00:02:04.770> page<00:02:04.950> 1<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.150> go<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
your page 1 it can actually go up and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.369 
your page 1 it can actually go up and
down<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.830> four<00:02:08.340> different<00:02:08.789> pages<00:02:08.939> this<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
down to four different pages this so you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.430 
down to four different pages this so you
have<00:02:10.439> four<00:02:10.950> different<00:02:11.849> rows<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:13.200> cues

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
have four different rows of cues

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.690 
have four different rows of cues
and<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.240> bottom<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.840> now<00:02:17.410> I've

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and in on the bottom there now I've

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.950 
and in on the bottom there now I've
pre-programmed<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.790> few<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.780> is

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
pre-programmed a few here so this is

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.100 
pre-programmed a few here so this is
like<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> house<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.400> far

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
like the house on one this is the far

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.910 
like the house on one this is the far
part<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> alleyway<00:02:28.260> 2/3<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.620> closed

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
part of the alleyway 2/3 is the closed

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.960 
part of the alleyway 2/3 is the closed
part<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> alleyway<00:02:31.710> four<00:02:32.710> would<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
part of the alleyway four would be the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.770 
part of the alleyway four would be the
night<00:02:34.150> scene<00:02:34.480> down<00:02:34.720> at<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.020> end<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.380> v<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
night scene down at the end and v is the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.550 
night scene down at the end and v is the
grain<00:02:37.990> effect<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.020> basics<00:02:41.410> on

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
grain effect so that is the basics on

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
grain effect so that is the basics on
how<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.740> program<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:43.450> probably

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
how you program this we probably

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.500 
how you program this we probably
wouldn't<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.320> more<00:02:44.680> than<00:02:44.890> 24<00:02:45.640> cues<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.240> play

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
wouldn't use more than 24 cues in a play

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.600 
wouldn't use more than 24 cues in a play
for<00:02:46.780> master<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:47.770> would<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.040> leave<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
for master so I would just leave it a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.640 
for master so I would just leave it a
scene<00:02:48.820> page<00:02:49.030> 1<00:02:49.240> at<00:02:49.360> all<00:02:49.450> times<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
scene page 1 at all times this is the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.620 
scene page 1 at all times this is the
default<00:02:50.830> name<00:02:51.220> menu<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:52.030> can<00:02:52.180> browse<00:02:52.600> through

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
default name menu you can browse through

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.350 
default name menu you can browse through
it<00:02:52.990> using<00:02:53.080> these<00:02:53.350> arrows<00:02:53.770> up<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.190> down<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.210> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
it using these arrows up and down so the

it using these arrows up and down so the
main<00:02:55.540> one<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.750> want<00:02:55.930> worry<00:02:56.080> about<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.470> scene

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
main one you want worry about that scene
