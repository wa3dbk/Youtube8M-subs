just<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.540> give<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.320> quick<00:01:16.160> look<00:01:16.520> at<00:01:16.760> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
just to give you a quick look at the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.660 
just to give you a quick look at the
size<00:01:17.480> of<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.840> brush<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.920> that's<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.250> size<00:01:19.460> of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
size of the brush so that's the size of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.410 
size of the brush so that's the size of
the<00:01:19.790> brush<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.360> think<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:20.870> about<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:22.420> think

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
the brush I think it's about I think

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.850 
the brush I think it's about I think
this<00:01:23.510> is<00:01:23.630> about<00:01:23.750> an<00:01:24.020> average<00:01:24.140> sized<00:01:24.530> brush

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
this is about an average sized brush

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.250 
this is about an average sized brush
it's<00:01:25.250> not<00:01:25.460> too<00:01:25.640> thin<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:25.940> also<00:01:26.480> not<00:01:26.690> too<00:01:26.930> thick

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's not too thin and also not too thick

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's not too thin and also not too thick
I<00:01:27.560> actually<00:01:27.950> think<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.670> quite<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> good<00:01:29.330> size

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
having the magnetic effect I think

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.560 
having the magnetic effect I think
really<00:03:41.290> helped<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.880> really<00:03:43.239> helps

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
really helped and that really helps

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.819 
really helped and that really helps
beginners<00:03:43.959> because<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:44.530> really

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
beginners because it's just really

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.789 
beginners because it's just really
really<00:03:45.100> easy<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.930> only<00:03:47.170> markup

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
really easy to do and the only markup

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.039 
really easy to do and the only markup
you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.100> do<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.489> touching<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.299> magnet<00:03:49.930> on

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
you can do is touching the magnet on

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.289 
you can do is touching the magnet on
your<00:03:50.260> nail<00:03:50.440> which<00:03:50.769> can<00:03:51.040> also<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.610> fixable

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
your nail which can also be fixable

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.060 
your nail which can also be fixable
because<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.079> just<00:03:53.110> apply<00:03:53.500> another<00:03:53.950> layer

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
because you can just apply another layer

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.580 
because you can just apply another layer
and<00:03:54.430> that'll<00:03:54.790> pretty<00:03:55.299> much<00:03:55.390> clear<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.959> up<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.560> I

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
and that'll pretty much clear it up so I

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.220 
and that'll pretty much clear it up so I
think<00:03:56.850> those<00:03:57.850> are<00:03:57.880> definitely<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.720> pros<00:03:58.959> for

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
think those are definitely the pros for

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.819 
think those are definitely the pros for
me<00:03:59.380> i<00:03:59.590> also<00:03:59.920> found<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.870> very<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.260> very<00:04:02.320> good

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
me i also found it very a very good

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.319 
me i also found it very a very good
consistency<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.579> like<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> nail<00:04:04.030> polish

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
consistency I like the nail polish

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.349 
consistency I like the nail polish
itself<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.950> fakeness<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.180> also

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
itself I like the fakeness and I also

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.770 
itself I like the fakeness and I also
like<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
like the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.360 
like the
I<00:04:09.840> guess<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.170> creaminess<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.980> texture

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
I guess the creaminess and the texture

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.730 
I guess the creaminess and the texture
of<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:12.060> like<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.480> said<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:13.260> me<00:04:13.440> personally

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
of it but like I said for me personally

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.740 
of it but like I said for me personally
the<00:04:14.220> only<00:04:14.520> kind<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.150> product<00:04:15.450> would<00:04:15.690> be

the only kind of this product would be

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.349 
the only kind of this product would be
that<00:04:16.139> it's<00:04:16.470> metallic<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:17.670> not<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> huge

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
is 4 out of 5 stars only because I don't

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.659 
is 4 out of 5 stars only because I don't
really<00:04:36.900> like<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.290> color<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:37.800> do<00:04:37.889> think<00:04:38.280> the

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
really like the color but I do think the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.480 
really like the color but I do think the
effects<00:04:39.060> are<00:04:39.330> pretty<00:04:39.600> cool<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.380> another<00:04:41.280> good

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
effects are pretty cool and another good

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.000 
effects are pretty cool and another good
thing<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.180> effects<00:04:42.630> will<00:04:43.140> be<00:04:43.200> unique

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
thing is that the effects will be unique

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.590 
thing is that the effects will be unique
every<00:04:44.520> time<00:04:44.730> it's<00:04:45.030> not<00:04:45.060> going<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.480> the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
every time it's not going to have the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.000 
every time it's not going to have the
same<00:04:45.630> effect<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:46.560> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> be<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:46.919> a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
same effect so it's going to be in a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.280 
same effect so it's going to be in a
true<00:04:47.250> belief<00:04:47.550> look<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.960> know<00:04:49.050> how<00:04:49.230> many

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
true belief look but you know how many

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.810 
true belief look but you know how many
ripples<00:04:49.620> are<00:04:49.890> there<00:04:50.010> going<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.220> be<00:04:50.280> how<00:04:50.580> far

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
ripples are there going to be how far

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.920 
ripples are there going to be how far
apart<00:04:50.940> they're<00:04:51.360> going<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.540> be<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.720> going<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
apart they're going to be it's going to

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.540 
apart they're going to be it's going to
be<00:04:51.990> different<00:04:52.169> every<00:04:52.440> time<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.190> think

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
be different every time so I think

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.550 
be different every time so I think
that's<00:04:53.700> pretty<00:04:53.910> cool<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.080> know<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.500> you
