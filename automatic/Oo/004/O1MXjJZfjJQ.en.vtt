00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
without knowing the actual truth I think

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540 
without knowing the actual truth I think
that's<00:02:16.080> completely<00:02:16.260> unfair<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> him<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that's completely unfair to him and to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.780 
that's completely unfair to him and to
his<00:02:17.580> entire<00:02:17.880> family<00:02:19.160> being<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.310> part<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.670> this
