obviously<00:01:57.140> they're<00:01:57.319> not<00:01:57.530> catching<00:01:58.149> issues

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149

that<00:01:59.360> they<00:01:59.479> should<00:01:59.720> have<00:01:59.810> caught<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.349> so<00:02:00.500> this

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
that they should have caught and so this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.749

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
is something that they're going to have

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.279 
is something that they're going to have
to<00:02:01.910> step<00:02:02.119> up<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.450> figure<00:02:02.750> out<00:02:02.810> what<00:02:03.110> went

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
to step up and figure out what went

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
huge number it seems like it's crying

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.140 
huge number it seems like it's crying

would you tell metell to do right now
well<00:05:58.099> I<00:05:58.130> think<00:05:58.400> Mattel<00:05:58.940> is<00:05:59.150> doing<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.570> lot<00:05:59.780> of

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
well I think Mattel is doing a lot of

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.839 
well I think Mattel is doing a lot of
the<00:06:00.080> best<00:06:00.320> things<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.680> they<00:06:01.460> should<00:06:01.669> be

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
the best things that they should be

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.879 
the best things that they should be
doing<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.270> mean<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.479> think<00:06:02.599> they're<00:06:03.050> getting

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
doing I mean I think they're getting

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.279 
doing I mean I think they're getting
their<00:06:04.039> story<00:06:04.400> out<00:06:04.669> in<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.090> publicity<00:06:05.450> in<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
their story out in the publicity in the

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.409 
their story out in the publicity in the
media<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:06.860> think<00:06:07.340> they're<00:06:07.729> probably<00:06:07.940> going<00:06:08.330> to

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
media I think they're probably going to

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.860 
media I think they're probably going to
be<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:08.570> lot<00:06:08.840> more<00:06:10.300> thoughtful<00:06:11.300> about<00:06:11.419> how<00:06:11.570> they

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
be a lot more thoughtful about how they

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.379 
be a lot more thoughtful about how they
go<00:06:12.050> about<00:06:12.250> making<00:06:13.250> sure<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.880> their<00:06:14.000> products

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
go about making sure that their products

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.930 
go about making sure that their products
are<00:06:14.770> working<00:06:15.770> appropriately<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:16.820> the

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
are working appropriately that the

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.300 
are working appropriately that the
products<00:06:17.360> are<00:06:17.590> appropriately<00:06:18.590> painted<00:06:19.130> or

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
products are appropriately painted or

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.719 
products are appropriately painted or
what<00:06:19.430> have<00:06:19.700> you<00:06:19.729> and<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.570> think<00:06:20.840> that<00:06:21.050> Mattel

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
what have you and I think that Mattel

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.969 
what have you and I think that Mattel
will<00:06:22.930> probably<00:06:23.930> be<00:06:24.080> a<00:06:24.110> better<00:06:24.289> company<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:24.919> I

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
will probably be a better company and I

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.770 
will probably be a better company and I
think<00:06:25.220> all<00:06:25.460> manufacturers<00:06:26.270> are<00:06:26.479> going<00:06:26.599> to<00:06:26.660> be

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
think all manufacturers are going to be

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.930 
think all manufacturers are going to be
better<00:06:26.960> for<00:06:27.590> this<00:06:27.680> unfortunate<00:06:27.940> experience

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
better for this unfortunate experience

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.190 
better for this unfortunate experience
because<00:06:29.300> they're<00:06:29.450> going<00:06:29.539> to<00:06:29.630> start<00:06:29.870> paying

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
because they're going to start paying

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.710 
because they're going to start paying
more<00:06:30.410> attention<00:06:30.979> to<00:06:31.010> what<00:06:31.820> they<00:06:32.180> have<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.570> do

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
more attention to what they have to do

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.200 
more attention to what they have to do
Melissa<00:06:33.289> I<00:06:33.710> think<00:06:34.400> Joe<00:06:34.580> dead<00:06:34.910> wrong<00:06:35.180> about

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
Melissa I think Joe dead wrong about

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.089 
Melissa I think Joe dead wrong about
this<00:06:35.660> being<00:06:35.870> an<00:06:36.020> astonishingly<00:06:36.620> small

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
this being an astonishingly small

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.400 
this being an astonishingly small
problem<00:06:37.639> it's<00:06:37.789> a<00:06:37.880> huge<00:06:38.240> problem<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.930> mean<00:06:39.260> the

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
problem it's a huge problem I mean the

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.279 
problem it's a huge problem I mean the
Chinese<00:06:39.860> say<00:06:40.099> look<00:06:40.340> less<00:06:40.849> than<00:06:41.060> 1%<00:06:41.750> failure

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289
