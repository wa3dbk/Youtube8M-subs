across<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.710> that's<00:03:04.190> going<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.430> be<00:03:04.610> your

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
across like that that's going to be your

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.170 
across like that that's going to be your
the<00:03:05.480> top<00:03:05.750> part<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.620> has<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.860> begun<00:03:07.340> then

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the top part that has the begun then

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.270 
the top part that has the begun then
sandstone<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.230> stairs<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:12.260> just<00:03:12.740> follow<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
sandstone and stairs so just follow the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.280 
sandstone and stairs so just follow the
pattern<00:03:13.520> that<00:03:13.810> melded<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:14.959> here<00:03:17.140> make<00:03:18.140> sure

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
pattern that melded right here make sure

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.650 
pattern that melded right here make sure
those<00:03:18.500> stairs<00:03:18.800> are<00:03:19.130> curved<00:03:19.520> because<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.300> not

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
those stairs are curved because it's not

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.050 
those stairs are curved because it's not
going<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.900> look<00:03:20.989> very<00:03:21.050> very<00:03:21.500> good<00:03:22.100> if<00:03:22.520> they're

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
going to look very very good if they're

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.390 
going to look very very good if they're
not<00:03:23.209> then<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.200> want<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.410> take<00:03:24.560> fences<00:03:25.070> put

right we'll get back in there in a sec
so<00:04:00.860> put<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.670> trapdoor<00:04:02.300> right<00:04:02.570> there<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:02.900> so

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
so put a trapdoor right there just so

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.320 
so put a trapdoor right there just so
you<00:04:03.200> don't<00:04:03.320> fall<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.830> there<00:04:03.950> an<00:04:04.040> accident<00:04:04.330> take

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
a piece of grey carpet put it right

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.600 
a piece of grey carpet put it right
there<00:04:07.400> destroy<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:08.450> block<00:04:08.660> build<00:04:09.050> up<00:04:09.610> just

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
there destroy one block build up just

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.680 
there destroy one block build up just
like<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:11.769> put<00:04:12.769> a<00:04:12.980> normal<00:04:13.579> track

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
like that put a normal track

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.870 
like that put a normal track
and<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:15.500> minecart<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.160> can<00:04:16.340> actually<00:04:16.489> get

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
and a minecart so you can actually get

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.979 
and a minecart so you can actually get
in<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.239> out<00:04:17.330> there<00:04:18.140> you<00:04:18.290> go<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:19.870> inside<00:04:20.870> is

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
in and out there you go and inside is

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.960 
in and out there you go and inside is
going<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.140> be<00:04:21.260> fairly<00:04:21.560> simple<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.040> trap<00:04:22.700> doors

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
going to be fairly simple to trap doors

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to be fairly simple to trap doors
on<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.180> sides<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:24.530> away<00:04:24.650> from<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.860> back

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
on the sides one away from the back

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.060 
on the sides one away from the back
because<00:04:26.000> that's<00:04:26.240> going<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.480> where<00:04:26.690> you're

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
because that's going to be where you're

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.630 
because that's going to be where you're
you<00:04:28.070> know<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:28.640> people<00:04:28.880> sit<00:04:29.810> back<00:04:30.640> alright

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
you know just people sit back alright

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.310 
you know just people sit back alright
and<00:04:31.910> in<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.540> front<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.020> be<00:04:33.110> pretty

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
and in the front is going to be pretty

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.290 
and in the front is going to be pretty
similar<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:33.950> not<00:04:34.160> exactly<00:04:34.580> you're<00:04:35.090> going<00:04:35.210> to

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
similar but not exactly you're going to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.260 
similar but not exactly you're going to
take<00:04:35.540> two<00:04:35.780> two<00:04:36.350> redstone<00:04:36.740> blocks<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.940> as<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
take two two redstone blocks to as the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.570 
take two two redstone blocks to as the
lamps<00:04:38.600> just<00:04:38.740> like<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.950> just<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.340> light<00:04:40.460> up

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
lamps just like that just to light up
