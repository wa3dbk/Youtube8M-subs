00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
down the pace the game for me so I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
down the pace the game for me so I
really<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:54.990> enjoy<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> classic<00:01:55.829> playlist

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
really do not enjoy the classic playlist

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.190 
really do not enjoy the classic playlist
which<00:01:56.310> before<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.090> game<00:01:57.299> came<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> really

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
which before this game came out I really

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.389 
which before this game came out I really
thought<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
thought that I was going to be in that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
thought that I was going to be in that
playlist<00:01:59.729> because<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> didn't<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
playlist because I didn't think that I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
playlist because I didn't think that I
would<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.159> games<00:02:02.520> exosuit<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.390> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
would like this games exosuit as much as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
would like this games exosuit as much as
I<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.290> other<00:02:04.530> major<00:02:04.890> concern<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
I do and one other major concern that I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.119 
I do and one other major concern that I
had<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.600> game<00:02:06.869> were<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> XO<00:02:07.740> abilities

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
had with this game were the XO abilities

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
had with this game were the XO abilities
I<00:02:08.250> thought<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.959> excellent<00:02:09.959> role<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I thought that the excellent role is

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.840 
I thought that the excellent role is
a man<00:02:10.650> be<00:02:10.740> really<00:02:10.979> overpowered<00:02:11.580> really

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
a man be really overpowered really

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.030 
a man be really overpowered really
annoying<00:02:12.120> however<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.140> way<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.590> they<00:02:13.680> put

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
annoying however the way that they put

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
annoying however the way that they put
the<00:02:14.250> XO<00:02:14.580> ease<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.180> game<00:02:15.360> especially<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the XO ease in this game especially the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
the XO ease in this game especially the
cloak<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.950> doesn't<00:02:17.520> make<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.970> too

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
cloak it really doesn't make them too

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120 
cloak it really doesn't make them too
crucial<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.930> even<00:02:19.170> run<00:02:19.320> they're<00:02:19.620> really<00:02:19.860> fun

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
crucial to even run they're really fun

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.040 
crucial to even run they're really fun
and<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.340> affected<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> run<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.510> certain

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and really affected to run in certain

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
and really affected to run in certain
times<00:02:22.290> however<00:02:22.530> they're<00:02:23.100> by<00:02:23.250> no<00:02:23.280> means

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
times however they're by no means

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550

required and cloak is by no means as

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
required and cloak is by no means as
annoying<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.130> thought<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> would<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.700> which

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
annoying as I thought it would be which

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
annoying as I thought it would be which
is<00:02:27.420> definitely<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.990> relief<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:28.710> when<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
is definitely a relief because when you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.440 
is definitely a relief because when you
have<00:02:29.130> cloaking<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> first<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> comes

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
have cloaking the first thing that comes

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.150 
have cloaking the first thing that comes
to<00:02:30.540> mind<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.960> camping<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> corner<00:02:31.980> while

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
to mind is camping in a corner while

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
to mind is camping in a corner while
being<00:02:32.340> invisible<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.970> nobody<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.840> mean

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
being invisible and nobody and I mean

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
being invisible and nobody and I mean
nobody<00:02:34.190> wants<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.250> deal<00:02:35.460> with<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.120> I'm

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
nobody wants to deal with that so I'm

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.550 
nobody wants to deal with that so I'm
going<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> kind<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.780> revisit<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> question

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
going to kind of revisit the question

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
going to kind of revisit the question
that<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.070> asked<00:02:38.460> earlier<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.120> guys<00:02:39.330> think

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that I asked earlier do you guys think

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.350 
that I asked earlier do you guys think
that<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.560> exosuit<00:02:41.130> has<00:02:41.400> set<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> standards

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that the exosuit has set the standards

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.600 
that the exosuit has set the standards
for<00:02:42.510> call<00:02:42.870> due<00:02:43.080> do<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.320> think<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.710> other<00:02:43.950> Cod

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
for call due do you think that other Cod

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.280 
for call due do you think that other Cod
tails<00:02:44.940> made<00:02:45.180> by<00:02:45.300> other<00:02:45.540> developers<00:02:46.260> should

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
tails made by other developers should

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.620 
tails made by other developers should
have<00:02:46.740> an<00:02:46.890> exosuit<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> my<00:02:48.240> answer<00:02:48.450> is

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
have an exosuit in them and my answer is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.900 
have an exosuit in them and my answer is
both<00:02:48.930> yes<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.290> no<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.800> think<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
both yes and no I do think that if it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.700 
both yes and no I do think that if it's
themed<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.720> right<00:02:51.900> way<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.680> can't

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
themed the right way like you can't

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.410 
themed the right way like you can't
really<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.340> an<00:02:53.460> exosuit<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
really have an exosuit and like a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
really have an exosuit and like a
Vietnam<00:02:54.930> shooter<00:02:55.320> or<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> world<00:02:56.100> war<00:02:56.250> two

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
Vietnam shooter or a world war two

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.160 
Vietnam shooter or a world war two
should<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.760> really<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.690> wouldn't<00:02:57.990> even<00:02:58.020> be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
should it really was it wouldn't even be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.540 
should it really was it wouldn't even be
natural<00:02:58.620> at<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:58.740> because<00:02:58.980> could<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.340> imagine

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
natural at all because could you imagine

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.150 
natural at all because could you imagine
boost<00:02:59.970> jumping<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.870> era<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.860> would

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
boost jumping and that era it just would

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.610 
boost jumping and that era it just would
not<00:03:02.310> look<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:03.000> at<00:03:03.300> all<00:03:03.540> however<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.470> it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
not look right at all however if it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
not look right at all however if it's
like<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.770> black<00:03:05.370> ops<00:03:05.610> 2<00:03:05.850> theme<00:03:06.270> door<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
like a black ops 2 theme door like a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.080 
like a black ops 2 theme door like a
maybe<00:03:07.170> even<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.680> kind<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.400> themed<00:03:08.610> game<00:03:08.880> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
maybe even this kind of themed game I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
maybe even this kind of themed game I
think<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.690> would<00:03:09.810> really<00:03:09.990> fit<00:03:10.350> well<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:10.950> whole
