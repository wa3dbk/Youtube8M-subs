00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 made a scout to everyone who served and was 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.150
 I dedicate this video to a scout 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 it is this holiday 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.040
 namely, because I myself was 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.730
 scout for a while literally 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 five years here and decided to share my 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.520
 impression of the past who had gone tion 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 times don't know exactly say here a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.750
 exactly when he served I served in the arch 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 those far network but actually far 67 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 parallel north i mean it was cold 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 in a snowdrift and who served then knows 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.520
 I hope that all the same someone was 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.510
 scouts their subscribers can and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.750
 future subscribers no matter I left 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 It has long been possible to serve it yet 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.489
 after school and enroll not acted like 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.559
 Usually it happens that it is there 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.739
 Vorkuta is the most interesting when I'm 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.980
 I come to call the recruiting station and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 more precisely, even we have a machine muzhik 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.979
 asked then if you know the type 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.939
 english i said yes so type 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.280
 what yasoppa 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.910
 here later, well , why he 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 interested here he says 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.950
 what are you going to type on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.340
 I certainly have a translator 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.440
 surprise and typewriter translator well 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 then a particularly did not know what it is, 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.940
 He said that the type of location of this 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.760
 In general, that somewhere near our city 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.520
 I will be like this when I came 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.220
 Directly the day of dispatch 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.120
 it was then that I learned something vorkuta though 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.600
 and especially then did not know the Titans and learned 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.130
 when you were on the train you look at it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.400
 window and see the sea city ​​at once 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.530
 it becomes clear that it will be very cold 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.660
 so well, here we come 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 there was not a particularly cold principle 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.130
 We arrived in the summer of June brought us to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.780
 the training unit immediately saw someone there 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.580
 I ask and call but then still did not know that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.670
 This past trailer thought this type 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.860
 old servicemen there is one in the toilet 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 of them there we decided specifically 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.180
 scare and not knowing but most kabuki went 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.740
 man how then isolate not much 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.040
 did such a typical 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.850
 and incomprehensible to the future person here 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.950
 but that's not the point 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.660
 that is, he is the first person to say that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 type now you go to the bath there 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.560
 if the level of incentive is never 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.550
 lean well respectively in all 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.710
 thought the storm of another plan why be missed 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.900
 it seemed like it 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.910
 because in the army there is such a bullshit that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.490
 if the walker dropped them some shower 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.790
 the object of its type can not lift well, as 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.020
 in prison that if you get down on 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.570
 throw there on takeoff to a clean place 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.120
 there are already passers-by lift then wash but 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.890
 this is not the essence 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.700
 Well, we were engaged in the army 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.400
 respectively 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.140
 intelligence that is accordingly 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.270
 I tell all this to the equipment 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.340
 I will not and everything else you can go 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.040
 to the site of the radio scanner dot ru valid and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.670
 there all this is already there to listen than 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.220
 were engaged 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.040
 Here, namely, listened to the air 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.300
 space that is our main our 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.200
 potential adversary 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.530
 you know, so I listened 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.580
 ikao international civil aviation women 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.730
 i.e. these are international airlines 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.100
 roughly speaking here that is i listened and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.350
 heard the aeroflot and various ie ours 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.170
 since they are in English it says 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.820
 my aeroflot fritatu let's say that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.260
 Japanese, too, all shorter 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.220
 sit down and everyone is absolutely burning up 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.780
 English in this international 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.040
 roughly speaking the language 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.820
 the main thing that we did not need to dry 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.810
 oars not 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.980
 civilian aircraft and so on 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.330
 military that is bombers 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.970
 various that is 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.040
 flight to tankers together 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.040
 tactical aviation that is up to everyones 16 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:16.450
 so on here are American fighters 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.570
 well, it was interesting enough about 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.700
 judging I went through the shift need to post 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.100
 there I ’m talking about hardware already 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.600
 I will say what it was that is 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.320
 Respectively big antenna it and so 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.360
 Understandable which take your plane and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.400
 so on I had on lines in common 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.950
 the complexity of 600 shifts that is there is very 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.660
 I found it difficult that is on my 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.350
 I practically sat and still 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.150
 any of my two colleagues 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.580
 because everything was constantly changing 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.670
 here is one there hospital is about the second 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.950
 where on vacation will go home that is tough 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.660
 of course there were 600 wholes exactly at the end 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.950
 already class jerked simply 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.390
 well then everything turned so that me 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.670
 wanted to stay on the lines on 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.400
 I speak a shirt on a contract that is 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.950
 principle what I did after living in 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.410
 one and a half hours three and a half years on 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.490
 here are my plans there are not 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.760
 It turned out I went home that's the principle and 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:22.850
 all that probably could tell 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:26.120
 about the army and served here is something of interest 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.670
 ask article can tell can 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 here and going to go in principle 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.110
 nothing is terrible especially if you 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.390
 eat vorkuta know everything is good there 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.110
 Dolphins are not and when I arrived there was no 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.390
 bullying 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.300
 that is, the maximum there in Russian talas 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.700
 pierced our period there spirits and rudely 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.370
 speaking to the lasso too drank but 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.670
 more strain the sheets you push up 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.170
 still this principle for yours 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:57.680
 use someone says to not favor going 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.180
 squeeze pulling up like that here 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:12.780
 thank you all for watching 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:18.470
 Good luck, bye bye firewood vodka and here is shorter 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.470
 food as you I will give you a path here 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:33.280
 smoke eat hi lo low
