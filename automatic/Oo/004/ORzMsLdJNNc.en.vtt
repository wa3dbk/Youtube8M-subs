00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.420 
just choose your language your icons you
choose<00:02:51.819> average<00:02:52.209> quality<00:02:52.510> if<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:54.250> choose

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
choose average quality if you choose

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.820 
choose average quality if you choose
high<00:02:54.610> quality<00:02:55.090> it'll<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.450> slower<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.709> you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
high quality it'll be slower if you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.190 
high quality it'll be slower if you
choose<00:02:56.980> average<00:02:57.400> quality<00:02:57.640> that's<00:02:58.599> what<00:02:58.780> it's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
choose average quality that's what it's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800 
choose average quality that's what it's
just<00:02:59.380> regular<00:03:00.010> speed<00:03:00.610> if<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.330> choose<00:03:01.510> low

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
just regular speed if you choose low

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.660 
just regular speed if you choose low
quality<00:03:02.110> it'll<00:03:02.440> be<00:03:02.530> faster<00:03:03.099> but<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.459> won't

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
quality it'll be faster but it won't

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.589 
quality it'll be faster but it won't
look<00:03:03.790> at<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:03.970> let's<00:03:04.299> try<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> low<00:03:04.810> quality<00:03:09.599> yeah

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
look at you let's try a low quality yeah

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.589 
look at you let's try a low quality yeah
see<00:03:10.930> they're<00:03:11.200> more<00:03:11.440> fuzzy<00:03:12.239> I'm<00:03:13.239> like<00:03:13.420> that

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
see they're more fuzzy I'm like that

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.210 
see they're more fuzzy I'm like that
much<00:03:13.810> let's<00:03:14.019> try<00:03:14.079> high<00:03:14.380> quality<00:03:17.069> that's<00:03:18.069> not

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
much let's try high quality that's not

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.350 
much let's try high quality that's not
bad<00:03:18.430> it's<00:03:19.420> pretty<00:03:19.599> faster<00:03:20.940> ok<00:03:21.940> I'm<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.180> going

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
bad it's pretty faster ok I'm just going

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.150 
bad it's pretty faster ok I'm just going
to<00:03:22.420> keep<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.720> average<00:03:22.989> ecology<00:03:23.349> you<00:03:24.010> can

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
to keep it on average ecology you can

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.630 
to keep it on average ecology you can
choose<00:03:24.400> their<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.030> opaque<00:03:25.360> d<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.959> icons

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
choose their the opaque d of the icons

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.930 
choose their the opaque d of the icons
and<00:03:28.140> if<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.530> want<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.920> zoom<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.470> stuff

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and if you want it to zoom in and stuff

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.379 
and if you want it to zoom in and stuff
um<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:35.889> can<00:03:36.010> choose<00:03:36.489> how<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.790> want<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.239> to

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
um you can choose how you want it to

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.550 
um you can choose how you want it to
zoom<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:39.130> size<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.790> zoom<00:03:40.410> see<00:03:41.410> you

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
zoom and the size of the zoom see you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.490 
zoom and the size of the zoom see you
mines<00:03:41.769> out<00:03:41.950> 42<00:03:42.430> PX<00:03:43.030> but<00:03:43.480> say<00:03:43.930> I'll<00:03:44.049> put<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.380> all

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
mines out 42 PX but say I'll put it all

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.059 
mines out 42 PX but say I'll put it all
the<00:03:44.620> way<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:45.100> will<00:03:45.579> make<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.030> wider<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the way up that will make it wider but I

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.539 
the way up that will make it wider but I
like<00:03:48.250> minus<00:03:48.489> 42<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:50.040> am<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.130> going<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.400> bubble

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
like minus 42 and am I going to bubble

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.729 
like minus 42 and am I going to bubble
right<00:03:51.730> now<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.090> let's<00:03:52.269> do<00:03:52.389> flat<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.019> look

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
right now but let's do flat and look

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
can choose how much one is a zoom miles

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.110 
can choose how much one is a zoom miles
on<00:04:05.290> 52<00:04:05.680> PX<00:04:06.130> right<00:04:06.280> now<00:04:06.400> let's<00:04:06.639> put<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.819> all<00:04:06.970> the
