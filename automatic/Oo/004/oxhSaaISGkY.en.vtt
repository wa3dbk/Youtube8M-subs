 The quality of the camera in the smartphone is one of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 most important indicators when choosing this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 smartphone though what is this strange phrase 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.240

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.369
 notion 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 it is this smartphone to our surprise 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.230
 left you a lot of questions me 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.289
 name is Ivan Guchkov this site 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 revolverlab.com turn on go 4 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.750
 ultrapixel and it's a lot or a little as 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.199
 get out of one m7 resolution to the world 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.789
 84 ultrapixel and the number 4 is responsible here. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 for photo resolution when shooting 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 Maximum resolution of a photo about htc 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.869
 one m8 2688 for 1520 points to view 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.270
 photos on the full hd screen of the smartphone 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.979
 Although this is sufficient and it is enough 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.840
 for viewing on a large monitor 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 I do not think that many of you are at home 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 display resolution which exceeds 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 2000 600 points 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.189
 the only nuance at which quality 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.080
 htc one m8 photos can supply 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.479
 This with a large them or the same when pruning 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.280
 photos but what about cropping photos and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.960
 post-processing people are you serious 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 are going to scribble a photo and engage 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.310
 postprocessing in photoshop and lightroom 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 guys I ask you do not complicate yourself 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.240
 life a smartphone was created to her 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.710
 make life easier and mobile photo cycle 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.600
 ends up being laid out 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.850
 is this someone a social network or gone 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.109
 Forest save and now everything in the cloud 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.060
 make pictures everyone has phones 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.789
 a man walking around saw something and move 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.679
 filmed it but then a photo is a hospital and what 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.450
 If you take this picture and instantly 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.420
 put it on the net to share it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 with friends this instagram no I don't 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.229
 completely different my idea are you doing a photo 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.299
 and instantly put them on the net this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.579
 instagram then stop that you 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.860
 cling to him from him ideas to me he 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.230
 then even if you need printouts 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.299

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.250
 enough and why at all 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.920
 ultrapixel and the essence of ultrapixel and interesting 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.230
 unlike the ordinary ultrapixel pixel 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.879
 accumulates 300 times more light that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.560
 allows him to do better 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.720
 shots in the dark and now choose 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 you have a good photo quality with a bad one 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.650
 lighting or the ability to trim 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.590
