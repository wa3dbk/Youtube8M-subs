don't<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> falls<00:01:34.200> between<00:01:34.470> what

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
don't know where it falls between what

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
don't know where it falls between what
is<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> one's<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.360> exactly<00:01:36.930> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is this one's good for what exactly is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.819 
is this one's good for what exactly is
its<00:01:37.170> practical<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:40.140> essence<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
its practical use so in in essence it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.120 
its practical use so in in essence it
can<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> portrait<00:01:42.450> lens<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> use<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> sixty

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can be a portrait lens now I use a sixty

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
can be a portrait lens now I use a sixty
millimeter<00:01:44.329> macro<00:01:45.329> lens<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> Nikon<00:01:46.259> side

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
millimeter macro lens on the Nikon side

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
millimeter macro lens on the Nikon side
because<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> need<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.790> good

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
because you know I need a really good

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.730 
because you know I need a really good
macro<00:01:48.270> lens<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.259> doesn't<00:01:49.590> fall

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
macro lens but this doesn't fall

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.899 
macro lens but this doesn't fall
anywhere<00:01:49.950> close<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
anywhere close to there because this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.810 
anywhere close to there because this
focus<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:52.110> feet<00:01:52.350> away<00:01:52.820> typically

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
focus is about two feet away typically

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.670 
focus is about two feet away typically
between<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.479> 50s<00:01:54.899> normally<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.619> one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
between your 50s normally you get one

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.039 
between your 50s normally you get one
point<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.340> feet<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:56.969> point<00:01:57.210> five<00:01:57.420> feet<00:01:57.689> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
point two feet to one point five feet so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
point two feet to one point five feet so
you<00:01:58.140> even<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> stand<00:01:58.680> further<00:01:58.920> back<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you even have to stand further back this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
you even have to stand further back this
one<00:01:59.759> makes<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.659> sense<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.079> eight

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
one makes a little more sense it's eight

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.340 
one makes a little more sense it's eight
millimeters<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.899> 1.4<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
millimeters more but it is a 1.4 but so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.109 
millimeters more but it is a 1.4 but so
is<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> 50<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> 85<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is the 50 so the 85 what are you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
is the 50 so the 85 what are you
supposed<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.780> well<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.439> can

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
supposed to do well one thing you can

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.960 
supposed to do well one thing you can
expect<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> has<00:02:08.759> 9

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
expect from this because it has 9

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.089 
expect from this because it has 9
elements<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.660> sip<00:02:09.899> skirt<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> six<00:02:10.679> groups<00:02:10.920> and

has two aspherical elements to help with

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.280 
has two aspherical elements to help with
this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

for its price tag now for $1,700 you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.339 
for its price tag now for $1,700 you
would<00:02:26.069> hope<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.579> but<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.659> got<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.049> really

it's a plastic key built it's not the

it's a plastic key built it's not the

metal build that you would expect from

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
almost a $2,000 lens so that's something

is only 58 millimeters down and it's

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.339 
is only 58 millimeters down and it's
kind<00:03:17.729> of<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.940> buried<00:03:18.419> down<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> little<00:03:18.840> bit<00:03:19.049> so

kind of like buried down a little bit so
yeah<00:03:20.250> kind<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.639> deceiver<00:03:21.060> even<00:03:21.299> though<00:03:21.419> not

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
yeah kind of deceiver even though not

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.240 
yeah kind of deceiver even though not
sharp<00:03:22.019> fully<00:03:22.260> wide-open<00:03:22.829> not<00:03:22.949> a<00:03:22.979> lot<00:03:23.220> of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
sharp fully wide-open not a lot of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.069 
sharp fully wide-open not a lot of
lenses<00:03:23.699> are<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.359> said<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.659> does<00:03:24.810> pack<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
lenses are as I said it does pack a

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.969 
lenses are as I said it does pack a
little<00:03:25.260> bit<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.620> punch

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
little bit of a punch

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.390 
little bit of a punch
it's<00:03:26.129> contrasting<00:03:26.909> nd<00:03:27.180> bokeh<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:28.400> absolutely

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
it's contrasting nd bokeh is absolutely

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.140 
it's contrasting nd bokeh is absolutely
gorgeous

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
gorgeous

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.819 
gorgeous
and<00:03:30.479> I<00:03:30.840> really<00:03:31.049> want<00:03:31.199> to<00:03:31.260> talk<00:03:31.349> about<00:03:31.409> its<00:03:31.650> auto

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and I really want to talk about its auto

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.170 
and I really want to talk about its auto
focusing<00:03:32.370> too<00:03:32.579> because<00:03:32.849> that's<00:03:33.030> another

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
focusing too because that's another

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.089 
focusing too because that's another
thing<00:03:33.389> you're<00:03:33.659> paying<00:03:33.870> for<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.169> this<00:03:34.319> lens<00:03:34.530> yes

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
thing you're paying for in this lens yes

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.680 
thing you're paying for in this lens yes
it<00:03:35.250> does<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.699> silent<00:03:36.030> wave<00:03:36.150> motor<00:03:36.180> but

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
it does have that silent wave motor but

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.629 
it does have that silent wave motor but
I<00:03:36.720> think<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.169> is<00:03:37.349> really<00:03:37.650> really<00:03:37.829> fast<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
I think this is really really fast and

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.059 
I think this is really really fast and
snappy<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.629> if<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> go<00:03:40.049> between<00:03:40.229> so<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:40.979> is

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
snappy now if you go between so this is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.559 
snappy now if you go between so this is
your<00:03:41.250> since<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:41.909> a<00:03:41.970> prime<00:03:42.209> there's<00:03:42.449> no

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
your since it's a prime there's no

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.539 
your since it's a prime there's no
zooming<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.709> zoom<00:03:43.919> with<00:03:44.129> your<00:03:44.280> feet

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
zooming you have to zoom with your feet

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.839 
zooming you have to zoom with your feet
but<00:03:45.109> um<00:03:46.109> yeah<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.190> your<00:03:47.340> own<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.760> get

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
but um yeah so you get your own you get

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.369 
but um yeah so you get your own you get
your<00:03:48.030> focal<00:03:48.359> length<00:03:48.479> right<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.139> it's<00:03:49.290> a

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
your focal length right here and it's a

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.619 
your focal length right here and it's a
very<00:03:49.409> very<00:03:49.620> short<00:03:49.949> throw<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.549> from<00:03:51.209> one<00:03:51.389> side

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
very very short throw so from one side

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.689 
very very short throw so from one side
to<00:03:51.659> one<00:03:52.139> side<00:03:52.379> really<00:03:52.859> isn't<00:03:53.159> even<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.489> full

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
to one side really isn't even a full

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.339 
to one side really isn't even a full
turn<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.150> almost<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.449> quarter<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.930> turn<00:03:55.109> and

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
turn it's almost a quarter of a turn and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.259 
turn it's almost a quarter of a turn and
you've<00:03:55.769> already<00:03:56.010> went<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> full<00:03:56.639> focal<00:03:57.090> length

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
you've already went to full focal length

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.099 
you've already went to full focal length
the<00:03:57.989> full<00:03:58.169> focal<00:03:59.000> the<00:04:00.000> full<00:04:00.180> focus<00:04:00.569> range<00:04:00.750> so

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
the full focal the full focus range so

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.830 
the full focal the full focus range so
that's<00:04:01.590> something<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:02.010> could<00:04:02.129> keep<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.459> mind

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
that's something you could keep in mind

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.939 
that's something you could keep in mind
you<00:04:03.840> know<00:04:03.930> kind<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.260> shocking<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> doesn't

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
you know kind of shocking it doesn't

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.349 
you know kind of shocking it doesn't
give<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.129> little<00:04:05.250> more<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.729> the<00:04:05.790> price<00:04:06.030> tag

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
give you a little more for the price tag

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.390 
give you a little more for the price tag
but<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.659> guess<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.139> know<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.500> know<00:04:08.069> pick<00:04:08.280> your

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
but I guess you know you know pick your

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.750 
but I guess you know you know pick your
poison

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
poison

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.729 
poison
so<00:04:08.849> auto<00:04:09.030> focusing<00:04:09.540> good<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.259> test<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.590> on

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
so auto focusing good and I test this on

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.710 
so auto focusing good and I test this on
the<00:04:10.829> video<00:04:10.919> side<00:04:11.310> cuz<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.669> did<00:04:12.209> some<00:04:12.359> video<00:04:12.599> with

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
the video side cuz I did some video with

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.629 
the video side cuz I did some video with
this<00:04:12.870> as<00:04:13.049> well<00:04:13.229> and<00:04:13.439> it's<00:04:13.829> lens<00:04:14.129> breathing<00:04:14.579> is

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
this as well and it's lens breathing is

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.490 
this as well and it's lens breathing is
good<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.389> have<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.720> video<00:04:16.079> that<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.259> talked

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
good and I have a video that I talked

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.050 
good and I have a video that I talked
about<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.039> certs<00:04:17.280> one<00:04:17.459> channel<00:04:17.849> so<00:04:17.970> if

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
about that so certs one channel so if

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.649 
about that so certs one channel so if
you're<00:04:18.209> looking<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.599> for

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
you're looking for this for

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.020 
you're looking for this for
cinematography<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.769> think<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.549> really

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
cinematography I think this is a really

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.390 
cinematography I think this is a really
really<00:04:21.299> strong<00:04:21.630> video<00:04:22.229> lens<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.159> think

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
really strong video lens and I think

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.920 
really strong video lens and I think
that's<00:04:23.550> what<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:23.940> main<00:04:24.150> purpose<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:24.750> don't

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
that's what this main purpose is I don't

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.150 
that's what this main purpose is I don't
know<00:04:25.349> necessarily<00:04:25.740> if

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
know necessarily if

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.060 
know necessarily if
a<00:04:26.190> photography<00:04:27.030> 100%<00:04:27.960> lens<00:04:28.170> but<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.800> definitely

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
a photography 100% lens but I definitely

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.970 
a photography 100% lens but I definitely
think<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:29.970> more<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.540> video

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
think that it is more of a video

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.530 
think that it is more of a video
videography<00:04:32.120> cinematography<00:04:33.120> side<00:04:33.330> that

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
videography cinematography side that

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.020 
videography cinematography side that
people<00:04:33.570> should<00:04:34.170> look<00:04:34.290> into<00:04:34.640> over<00:04:35.640> just<00:04:35.910> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
people should look into over just the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.150 
people should look into over just the
photography<00:04:36.690> side<00:04:36.900> because<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.740> thing<00:04:37.950> for

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
photography side because this thing for

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.460 
photography side because this thing for
video<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.630> absolutely<00:04:39.630> gorgeous<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.350> it's

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
video is absolutely gorgeous and it's

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.500 
video is absolutely gorgeous and it's
great<00:04:40.710> as<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:40.920> said<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.970> know<00:04:42.060> it's<00:04:42.270> very<00:04:42.390> very

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
great as I said you know it's very very

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.450 
great as I said you know it's very very
contrast<00:04:43.230> II<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.530> it's<00:04:43.710> actually<00:04:44.220> really

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
contrast II and it's actually really

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.160 
contrast II and it's actually really
lightweight<00:04:44.820> as<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.270> said<00:04:45.450> it's<00:04:45.630> what<00:04:45.840> can<00:04:45.990> be

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
lightweight as I said it's what can be

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.780 
lightweight as I said it's what can be
deceiving<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:46.980> because<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.400> more<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.700> a

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
deceiving but because this is more of a

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.840 
deceiving but because this is more of a
plasticy<00:04:48.540> build<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:48.990> only<00:04:49.610> what<00:04:50.610> is<00:04:50.700> that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
plasticy build it's only what is that

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.210 
plasticy build it's only what is that
about<00:04:51.060> 14<00:04:51.630> ounces<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.320> it's<00:04:52.470> really<00:04:52.860> really

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
about 14 ounces so it's really really

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.360 
about 14 ounces so it's really really
light<00:04:53.400> bounces<00:04:54.270> well<00:04:54.480> on<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> DX<00:04:55.350> camera<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> on

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
light bounces well on a DX camera and on

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.630 
light bounces well on a DX camera and on
especially<00:04:57.240> might<00:04:57.420> be<00:04:57.570> 600<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.350> might<00:04:58.800> be<00:04:58.830> 700

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
especially might be 600 and might be 700

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.160 
especially might be 600 and might be 700
when<00:04:59.730> I<00:04:59.760> put<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.090> song<00:05:00.300> did<00:05:00.810> some<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.110> the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
when I put the song did some of the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.140 
when I put the song did some of the
tests<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.620> for<00:05:01.830> video<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.700> this<00:05:02.850> thing<00:05:03.030> is

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
tests and for video so this thing is

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.700 
tests and for video so this thing is
actually<00:05:03.360> really<00:05:03.570> really<00:05:03.840> lightweight<00:05:04.290> for

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
actually really really lightweight for

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.370 
actually really really lightweight for
what<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.040> is<00:05:05.070> but<00:05:05.970> um<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.600> know<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.930> packs<00:05:07.200> a

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
what it is but um you know it packs a

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.190 
what it is but um you know it packs a
punch<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.730> 58<00:05:09.150> does<00:05:09.480> actually<00:05:10.020> have<00:05:10.140> a

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
punch but the 58 does actually have a

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.140 
punch but the 58 does actually have a
purpose<00:05:10.500> at<00:05:10.800> first<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.340> didn't<00:05:11.790> think<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.120> did

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
purpose at first I didn't think it did

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.670 
purpose at first I didn't think it did
because<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.600> was<00:05:12.780> just<00:05:12.810> kind<00:05:13.140> of<00:05:13.170> random<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.560> me

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
because it was just kind of random to me

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.500 
because it was just kind of random to me
but<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.220> really<00:05:14.580> did<00:05:14.730> come<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.090> conclusion

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
but I really did come to the conclusion

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.300 
but I really did come to the conclusion
that<00:05:15.540> this<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.230> video<00:05:16.680> lines<00:05:17.010> even

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
that this is for a video lines even

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.860 
that this is for a video lines even
though<00:05:17.370> it's<00:05:17.490> not<00:05:17.610> intended<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.120> be<00:05:18.240> just

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
though it's not intended to be just

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.480 
though it's not intended to be just
because<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.260> way<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.470> acts<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.980> feels<00:05:20.010> and

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
because the way it acts and feels and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.970 
because the way it acts and feels and
and<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.240> know<00:05:21.390> it's<00:05:22.080> just<00:05:22.260> kind<00:05:22.410> of<00:05:22.530> how<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.890> is

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
and you know it's just kind of how it is

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.330 
and you know it's just kind of how it is
now<00:05:23.700> should<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.390> get<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:25.010> 51.4<00:05:26.010> so<00:05:26.160> did<00:05:26.250> you

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
now should you get the 51.4 so did you

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.720 
now should you get the 51.4 so did you
get<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.490> 85<00:05:27.210> one<00:05:27.660> point<00:05:27.930> four<00:05:28.200> once<00:05:28.980> again<00:05:29.220> 85

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
get the 85 one point four once again 85

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.250 
get the 85 one point four once again 85
is<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.970> straight<00:05:30.240> up<00:05:30.270> portrait<00:05:30.750> lens<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.200> I

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
is a straight up portrait lens and I

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.140 
is a straight up portrait lens and I
think<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.890> 50<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.790> know<00:05:32.910> for<00:05:33.120> a

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
think that the 50 you know for a

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.610 
think that the 50 you know for a
fraction<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.570> price<00:05:33.810> actually<00:05:34.380> works

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
fraction of the price actually works

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.250 
fraction of the price actually works
almost<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.850> same<00:05:36.150> in<00:05:36.480> all<00:05:36.600> reality<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.170> all

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
almost the same in all reality and all

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.630 
almost the same in all reality and all
honesty<00:05:37.800> as<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.850> 58<00:05:39.510> as<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.990> said<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:41.310> 85

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
honesty as this 58 as I said the 85

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.980 
honesty as this 58 as I said the 85
portrait<00:05:42.060> lens<00:05:42.240> that's<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.660> more<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
portrait lens that's the more of a

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.320 
portrait lens that's the more of a
specific<00:05:43.440> thing<00:05:43.620> 50<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.400> like<00:05:44.700> it<00:05:44.850> for<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.060> walk

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
specific thing 50 I like it for a walk

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.480 
specific thing 50 I like it for a walk
around<00:05:45.480> that<00:05:45.840> with<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.050> 35<00:05:46.530> but<00:05:47.100> for<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.340> 58

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
around that with a 35 but for the 58

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.460 
around that with a 35 but for the 58
gets<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.120> little<00:05:48.300> too<00:05:48.570> tight<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.050> too

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
gets a little too tight and it's too

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.640 
gets a little too tight and it's too
close<00:05:49.890> to<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.250> 60<00:05:50.490> millimeter<00:05:51.000> micro<00:05:51.900> or

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
close to the 60 millimeter micro or

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.980 
close to the 60 millimeter micro or
macro<00:05:52.680> whatever<00:05:53.340> you're<00:05:53.490> using<00:05:53.700> that<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.780> just

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
macro whatever you're using that is just

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.770 
macro whatever you're using that is just
like<00:05:55.140> kind<00:05:55.440> of<00:05:55.500> cancels<00:05:55.950> out<00:05:56.100> in<00:05:56.400> a<00:05:56.520> way<00:05:56.669> so<00:05:57.390> I

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
like kind of cancels out in a way so I

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.770 
like kind of cancels out in a way so I
think<00:05:58.710> this<00:05:58.860> is<00:05:59.010> more<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.550> video<00:05:59.910> lens<00:06:00.240> even

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
think this is more of a video lens even

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.450 
think this is more of a video lens even
though<00:06:00.870> it's<00:06:00.990> not<00:06:01.110> intended<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:01.590> be<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:02.340> is

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
though it's not intended to be that is

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.010 
though it's not intended to be that is
my<00:06:02.580> opinion<00:06:02.850> what<00:06:03.300> do<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.450> guys<00:06:03.570> think<00:06:03.630> down

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
my opinion what do you guys think down

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.990 
my opinion what do you guys think down
below<00:06:04.050> especially<00:06:04.470> you<00:06:04.680> guys<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.070> have<00:06:05.250> you

something<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:25.919> miss<00:06:26.190> in<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.490> lot<00:06:26.640> of<00:06:26.760> these<00:06:26.850> G

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
something I miss in a lot of these G

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.620 
something I miss in a lot of these G
lenses<00:06:27.510> is<00:06:27.660> that<00:06:27.990> contrast<00:06:28.620> see<00:06:28.800> that<00:06:28.950> awesome

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
lenses is that contrast see that awesome

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.030 
lenses is that contrast see that awesome
just<00:06:30.630> that<00:06:30.750> look<00:06:31.050> that<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:31.350> kind<00:06:31.590> of<00:06:31.650> gives<00:06:31.860> you

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
just that look that it kind of gives you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.180 
just that look that it kind of gives you
and<00:06:32.400> this<00:06:33.120> returns<00:06:33.660> with<00:06:33.870> this<00:06:34.080> one<00:06:34.229> the<00:06:34.380> 51.4

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
and this returns with this one the 51.4

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.950 
and this returns with this one the 51.4
G<00:06:35.370> is<00:06:35.490> in<00:06:35.610> that<00:06:35.760> contrast<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.510> either<00:06:36.690> is<00:06:36.840> the

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
G is in that contrast and either is the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.439 
G is in that contrast and either is the
85<00:06:37.380> on<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:38.130> video<00:06:38.370> side<00:06:38.640> once

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
85 on the video side once

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.239 
85 on the video side once
I<00:06:39.509> think<00:06:40.110> this<00:06:40.229> is<00:06:40.379> more<00:06:40.529> of<00:06:40.590> a<00:06:40.680> video<00:06:40.889> lens

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
I think this is more of a video lens

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.330 
I think this is more of a video lens
over<00:06:41.460> a<00:06:42.289> straight<00:06:43.289> up<00:06:43.379> photography<00:06:43.740> still

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
over a straight up photography still

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.939 
over a straight up photography still
lens<00:06:44.550> but<00:06:45.210> that's<00:06:45.930> what<00:06:46.080> I<00:06:46.110> got<00:06:46.349> so<00:06:46.590> 58

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
lens but that's what I got so 58

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.399 
lens but that's what I got so 58
millimeter<00:06:47.189> video<00:06:47.639> maybe<00:06:48.509> go<00:06:48.749> with<00:06:48.870> the<00:06:48.960> 50<00:06:49.319> if

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
millimeter video maybe go with the 50 if

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.719 
millimeter video maybe go with the 50 if
you're<00:06:49.589> using<00:06:49.770> it<00:06:49.949> for<00:06:50.069> everyday<00:06:50.309> use<00:06:50.699> and

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
don't this isn't a good focal length for

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.299 
don't this isn't a good focal length for
portraits<00:06:54.930> go<00:06:55.080> with<00:06:55.199> the<00:06:55.319> 85<00:06:55.740> or<00:06:55.919> something

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:56.309 
portraits go with the 85 or something

would give up and say a 24 to 70 or a 85
or<00:07:25.650> 50<00:07:25.979> millimeter<00:07:26.370> for<00:07:26.580> just<00:07:26.909> because<00:07:27.210> it's

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 
or 50 millimeter for just because it's

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:28.700 
or 50 millimeter for just because it's
more<00:07:27.779> expensive<00:07:27.870> it's<00:07:28.379> supposed<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:28.589> be
