00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.920
 a last training camp of psv before 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.990
 the start of the competition has it 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 invested in England and two played there 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.849
 exhibition games in the first 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.559
 Wednesday night against nottinghamshire 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 striking name in the basic setup 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.800
 that of funchal ooyyo 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.990
 he plays defensive midfielder and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 that has everything to do with that psv 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 two offensive 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.840
 central midfielders deploy ola 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 toivones and georgino wine balance 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.420
 [Applause] 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.610
 psv puts busy strobeman and lens early 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469
 walk in each other's way but the ball comes 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 contact georginio wijnaldum and he 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030
 is the final court to order a splendid 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.190
 a 0 lead after the game tells 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 he that is lucky 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 but this is great for taking the lead 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.860
 come 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 PSV only cannot enjoy for a very long time 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.829
 from the lead 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.020
 we are talking about the tenth minute and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.789
 you hit the ball at the second post and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.309
 Paul has and that has to do 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.190
 let doctors run printed matter and that's how it is 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.949
 again the carelessness in the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 Eindhoven defense 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 not much later again psv via dries 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.650
 mertens 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.850
 showed himself the Belgian 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.979
 wing attacker combines psv 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.520
 easy shock when she ooyyo 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.259
 But keeper Lee Camp is there and so on 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.100
 psv will look for that again 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.860
 there is a head start on top of your straw man 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 sietse buddy mertens leave that is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 away 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.119
 looks for someone for target street that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.590
 is not the case and shoot yourself 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.270
 hit the outside of the pole 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 [Applause] 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.620
 then few changes in the second half 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.510
 in a psv manolev team is in the 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.160
 changing room 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 he has been replaced by erik pieters and 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.540
 that means that offer tamata 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.160
 moved to the right 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.410
 meanwhile, toivonen is through 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.450
 tries to find a free man the ball 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.520
 goes through a defender 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.670
 dangerous on goal but the goalkeeper of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.990
 save force 2 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.850
 [Applause] 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.390
 psv thus puts that pressure on in the second 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.000
 half want that lead 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.050
 Wijnaldum together in rush hour so with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 telephones 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.320
 but also together in midfield which 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.729
 the two had to keep a close eye on each other 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.190
 to hold 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.590
 always turning around outside 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 can go in here he goes to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.680
 inside and look for the hole for it 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 shot 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.390
 find that gap but don't know how to score 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.730
 lens ball at typhone turns and tightens 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.459
 then forester seems to come true 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.489
 but i pieters laptop ball at mertes 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.200
 gets dry from two one for psv 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.640
 and that's not how you do it already 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.480
 to be beautiful but this one is 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.590
 perfect for the business then again 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.350
 once a nottinghamshire attack 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.390
 only sparingly in the second half of the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.130
 forces flowed by too 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.930
 lee finds here it is admittedly one 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.739
 shot on goal but this brings you 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.750
 andreas axon is not in danger 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.370
 tomatoes with a growth get the ball 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.290
 back from straw man who finds angel 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.260
 substitute for bouma with a beautiful 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 stab at mertens 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.739
 who keeps the oreo overview 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.170
 admittedly wrong but Georgino wine balance 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.260
 not and that score is a second 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.090
 goal of the evening three one for PSV 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.370
 which will ultimately also be the final result 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.989
 and that's how the trip starts in England 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.989
 good for the team of fred rutten
