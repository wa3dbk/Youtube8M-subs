here's<00:00:11.920> some<00:00:12.160> of<00:00:12.340> my<00:00:12.990> electrolyte<00:00:13.990> that<00:00:14.290> we

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
here's some of my electrolyte that we

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.570 
here's some of my electrolyte that we
put<00:00:14.650> in<00:00:14.800> our<00:00:14.920> hydrogen<00:00:15.340> generators

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
put in our hydrogen generators

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.390 
put in our hydrogen generators
here's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.669> close-up<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.590> installation<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
here's a close-up of the installation of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.069 
here's a close-up of the installation of
the<00:00:20.609> water<00:00:20.849> trap<00:00:21.500> on<00:00:22.970> top<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.480> water<00:00:24.750> trap

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
the water trap on top of the water trap

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.839 
the water trap on top of the water trap
is<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.470> line<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.399> the<00:00:26.519> air<00:00:26.820> intake

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is the line out into the air intake

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.299 
is the line out into the air intake
manifold<00:00:27.840> which<00:00:28.769> tees<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.789> PCV<00:00:30.449> valve

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
manifold which tees into the PCV valve

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.299 
manifold which tees into the PCV valve
then<00:00:32.309> there's<00:00:32.550> copper<00:00:33.210> line<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.690> runs<00:00:33.780> over

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
then there's copper line that runs over

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.640 
then there's copper line that runs over
to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> hydrogen<00:00:36.269> oxygen<00:00:36.690> generator<00:00:37.409> which

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
to the hydrogen oxygen generator which

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.250 
to the hydrogen oxygen generator which
you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.949> see<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:41.269> this<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.329> installed<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.229> my

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you can see here this is installed in my

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.000 
you can see here this is installed in my
father's<00:00:44.269> red<00:00:45.269> Ford<00:00:45.860> Escort<00:00:47.030> station<00:00:48.030> wagon

and<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> might<00:00:51.869> not<00:00:52.830> look<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.369> car<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and you might not look at this car and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.189 
and you might not look at this car and
think<00:00:54.119> that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.409> wave<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.890> future

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
think that it's the wave of the future

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.520 
think that it's the wave of the future
but<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.379> does<00:00:59.339> as<00:00:59.549> well<00:00:59.729> as<00:00:59.939> a<00:00:59.970> hybrid<00:01:00.420> car<00:01:01.199> now

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but it does as well as a hybrid car now

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.549 
but it does as well as a hybrid car now
