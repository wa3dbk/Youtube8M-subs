clinically it's seven yards 32 29-yard

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.650 
clinically it's seven yards 32 29-yard
line<00:03:04.620> they've<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.310> move<00:03:05.819> this<00:03:05.880> ball<00:03:06.390> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
line they've got to move this ball to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.930 
line they've got to move this ball to
spot<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.319> have<00:03:07.890> no<00:03:08.100> idea<00:03:08.130> why<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.880> at<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> 36

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.150 

maybe<00:03:12.600> because<00:03:13.050> once<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.620> recovered

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
maybe because once the recovered

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.520 
maybe because once the recovered
recovery<00:03:15.120> key<00:03:15.270> twice<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:16.080> goes<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.440> other

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
recovery key twice that goes the other

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.980 
recovery key twice that goes the other
direction<00:03:16.620> yes<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.730> he<00:03:17.850> really<00:03:18.510> kidnapped

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
direction yes and he really kidnapped

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.240 
direction yes and he really kidnapped
Matt<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.320> imagine<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.770> he<00:03:19.830> didn't<00:03:19.980> take

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
Matt can you imagine if he didn't take

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.830 
Matt can you imagine if he didn't take
it<00:03:20.310> off<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.580> gone<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:21.000> down<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.830> all<00:03:23.840> so

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it off and gone on down and all so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.270 
it off and gone on down and all so
that's<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.740> reason<00:03:26.100> for<00:03:26.250> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
that's that that's the reason for that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310 
that's that that's the reason for that
but<00:03:26.520> when<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.000> review<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.810> plate<00:03:28.080> goes

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
but when they review this the plate goes

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.440 
but when they review this the plate goes
to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> 29<00:03:29.070> or<00:03:29.220> 30<00:03:29.370> yard<00:03:29.700> line<00:03:29.760> well<00:03:30.210> there's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
to the 29 or 30 yard line well there's

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.900 
to the 29 or 30 yard line well there's
those<00:03:30.810> two<00:03:31.020> questions<00:03:31.560> here<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.460> fumble

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
those two questions here is it a fumble

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.140 
those two questions here is it a fumble
and<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:34.650> don't<00:03:34.890> think<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.030> not

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
and we don't think it is and if it's not

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880 
and we don't think it is and if it's not
a<00:03:36.300> fumble<00:03:36.720> where<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.930> ball<00:03:37.140> was<00:03:37.290> spotted<00:03:37.740> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
a fumble where the ball was spotted and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.550 
a fumble where the ball was spotted and
it's<00:03:38.400> clear<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.300> not<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> fumble<00:03:40.080> he's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
it's clear if it's not a fumble he's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.950 
it's clear if it's not a fumble he's
down<00:03:40.800> around<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.130> 29-yard<00:03:41.820> line<00:03:41.940> I'm<00:03:42.570> Whitney

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
down around a 29-yard line I'm Whitney

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.070 
down around a 29-yard line I'm Whitney
if<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> fumble<00:03:44.670> they<00:03:45.330> have<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.720> back<00:03:45.930> at

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
if it is a fumble they have it back at

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.820 
if it is a fumble they have it back at
the<00:03:46.170> 36<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:47.430> only<00:03:47.550> have<00:03:47.760> two<00:03:48.000> choices<00:03:48.240> here

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
the 36 you only have two choices here

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.190 
the 36 you only have two choices here
but<00:03:49.830> but<00:03:50.070> I'm<00:03:50.220> going<00:03:50.490> with<00:03:50.550> your<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.960> absol<00:03:51.960> I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
but but I'm going with your a absol I

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.440 
but but I'm going with your a absol I
think<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> right<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.300> only

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
think it's the right one but you only

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.910 
think it's the right one but you only
have<00:03:54.630> two

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.490 

after<00:04:00.670> further<00:04:00.880> review<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:02.050> ruling<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.380> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
after further review the ruling on the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.780 
after further review the ruling on the
field<00:04:02.530> stands<00:04:03.220> where<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> balls<00:04:03.880> flow<00:04:05.790> well

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
field stands where the balls flow well

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.640 
field stands where the balls flow well
therefore<00:04:07.300> their<00:04:07.750> ruling<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.200> wasn't<00:04:08.620> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
therefore their ruling it wasn't a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.490 
therefore their ruling it wasn't a
fumble<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.640> don't<00:04:09.849> see<00:04:10.030> how<00:04:10.209> they<00:04:10.360> can

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
fumble and I don't see how they can

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.949 
fumble and I don't see how they can
deliver<00:04:11.500> one<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:12.190> us<00:04:12.400> was<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.819> fumble<00:04:13.180> which<00:04:13.750> I

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
deliver one of us was a fumble which I

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.870 
deliver one of us was a fumble which I
don't<00:04:14.020> see<00:04:14.349> how<00:04:14.470> they<00:04:14.620> can<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:15.160> don't<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
don't see how they can I don't have the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.199 
don't see how they can I don't have the
knees<00:04:16.060> down<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.780> ended<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.560> me

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
knees down it's ended this to me

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.740 
knees down it's ended this to me
the<00:04:20.139> knee<00:04:20.289> it's<00:04:20.500> clearly<00:04:20.889> down<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:22.090> dispute<00:04:22.630> in

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
the knee it's clearly down in dispute in

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.280 
the knee it's clearly down in dispute in
this<00:04:22.870> video<00:04:23.259> video<00:04:23.710> evidence

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.360 

obviously<00:04:27.130> they<00:04:27.310> didn't<00:04:27.670> think<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.000> was<00:04:28.090> into
