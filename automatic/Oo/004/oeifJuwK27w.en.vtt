00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.420
 will cut all depressed models 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:12.709
 that is existing today the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.709
 bartender that the public is saying 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.490
 what we are going to do is first the three 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.109
 pisco measurements that you in this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.160
 opportunity we are using pisco's 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 Carral taking himself face to the from 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.320
 now in this case we are going to use a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 a little generous measure of pisco sometimes 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.350
 that an eleven and a half nation we cast the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.000
 First 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.000
 important that is accurate 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.059
 second 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.460
 and wright 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 well that follows as 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.840
 the lemon cel 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.300
 played 16 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.790
 but not all of them do not wear all of us 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.790
 to see a measure nothing 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.470
 you want sweet peaks there will be a little bit of 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 Sun then one and a half 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.010
 and the designs in the almost closed and now 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.300
 the rubber syrup for the sweet 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.880
 in reference to the vargas 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.880
 but vargas pisco no 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 programs 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:50.830
 and they go from a bottle to the USA why 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.830
 replace it with sugar not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.470
 and the gÃ¡mez syrup is over 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.100
 and right now it is known that in fixed on 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.560
 Adolfo there is always a number 13 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.560
 number 13 that is intended for 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 13 is a cabalistic number 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.730
 do not 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.349
 4 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.830
 5 6 7 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.019
 8 9 10 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.680
 12 6 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.629

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.770

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.890
 let's count 15 seconds 15 seconds 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.890
 we usually go 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.790
 I'm not a whore 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.790

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.159
 baker 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.940
 Once there, it televises 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.470
 look at half or more is very important 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.490
 that the clear one we are going to tie after 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.490
 have beaten 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.310
 good 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.600
 we close and only four seconds 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.640
 are 19 seconds this is replaces the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.850
 shaker I really do not want to have a 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.819
 accounting 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.209
 many more 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.829
 much better and even the one who is going to give the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.829
 verdict of you 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.190
 best 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:42.419
 well this is served 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:46.830
 fast because the disk with this nice and 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:51.350
 bitter in the hand come on you are very 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.350
 It is very appropriate to remove the lid 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.779
 jon edited osman edita y colorado 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.420
 and now let me say it 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.569
 what you have done is for how many 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:24.979
 pressures for approximately 66 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.979
 8 but more served 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
 beautiful 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.729
 then let's enjoy the pisco 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.729
 sour 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.810
 and we are going to prepare it 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.879
 while they give him the speeches of this 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.879
 cable 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.030
 but there is the secret of the chef hahahaha 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.180
 and I think if you have to put 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.870
 eggs 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.870
