 step by step the way forward for the

 renovate started with a very shave grave 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.140
 to leave room for young grass 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.070
 that you are going to sow 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.169
 there are mistakes not to commit 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.880
 in most cases return the 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.079
 whole turf is not a good 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.849
 solution 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.380
 that's a lot of work and 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.570
 risk of germinating bad 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.760
 herbs present in the soil

 if your turf and very overgrown with 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 foam you can apply a product 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 anti foam however the products to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.360
 iron base acidifies the soil and promotes 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 the development of the foam is necessary 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.910
 yet fight it well because the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.510
 foam stifles the grass to prevent this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.820
 vicious circle preferred scarification 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.760
 it eliminates the foam and the felt 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.180
 airy and loosened soil is ready for the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.410
 sowing of grass during scarification 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.310
 cross the passages for a result 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.310
 more effective 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.189
 you can use a scarifier 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.500
 manual or pull the scarifier 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.360
 consists of a rotating disc equipped with 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.360
 thin metal blades that fits 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 in the first centimeters of the ground 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.130
 to keep good quality grass 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.049
 carry out scarification at least 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.149
 once a year in the spring or 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.020
 the autumn must follow a 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 relining seedlings 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.040
 remove the waste by a passage of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.040
 lawn mowers equipped with its bin 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 finish with a rake 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.930
 before sowing measure the surface for 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 estimate the amount of seeds 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 necessary for sowing by referring to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.280
 the dose above tells me on 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.280
 packing 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.230
 mix your grass seeds with 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 semi special soil so in one 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.700
 operation you sow and you create a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.150
 environment conducive to installation 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.100
 grass the presence of potting soil to 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 also for you benefit from 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 Easily locate locations already 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.290
 sow 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.170
 do not forget to mix the mixture well 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.760
 before you start sowing 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.549
 sowing on the fly the most 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.909
 homogeneous possible for that cross your 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.909
 crossings 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.700
 to create a good contact between 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.700
 seed and the earth proceed to a light 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.120
 settlement on the surface with your feet 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.880
 with a roll adapted finally 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.340
 water abundantly during the first 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.300
 weeks after sowing it is imperative 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.550
 to monitor the rainfall 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.560
 we have just told you how 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.860
 renovate a sod damaged or invaded by 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.810
 foam in some cases when the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.520
 grass is too deteriorated or too dirty 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.640
 it may not be enough 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720
 so after a very short mowing we 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 you recommend applying a 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.920
 total weed killer or tarpaulin 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.650
 after ten days the grass 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.680
 takes a yellowish tint proceed 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.130
 then as previously stated 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.280
