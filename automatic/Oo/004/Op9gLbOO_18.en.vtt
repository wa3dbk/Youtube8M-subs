 max and 48 points of damage minimum at 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.619
 level of the charger size and well 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.720
 it is the s12 which has the smallest 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.119
 charger ten bullets in the charger of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.920
 base and 14 balls with a big cap for 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.840
 the sweet m and his sixteen baseballs 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.580
 and 20 ball with a charger very calm 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.110
 now talk to you a little bit of 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.760
 the scope of the shotgun what is 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.490
 their door and max their reach with anna 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.780
 and their reach with silent these two 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.380
 shotguns have exactly the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.080
 from the same reach 13 m max 15 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.330
 meters with a cannon and 11 may of 5 with 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.800
 a silencer at the level of accessories 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 I personally have had the opportunity to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.310
 to test approximately 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.229
 two three days these two shotguns 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 frankly I recommend you to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.500
 play with over-equipped main what 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 will allow you to equip three 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.650
 accessories I advise you to put 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 fast charger targeting algeria cannes 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.940
 with the other accessories are 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.960
 really useless in quotation marks the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.640
 fast charger it's really 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.509
 indispensable on the twelve because he 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.710
 is really a long time between 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.910
 loaded and is that bullets by a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 very very fast program 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.550
 if you come across multiple enemies 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.780
 in front of you you risk being a little 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.700
 little in the shit unless of course 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.620
 that you have in the secondary then 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.150
 I advise you to play with a weapon 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.730
 secondary have finally two c4 in case 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.680
 we never know it can always be 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 helpful about them all I you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.290
 strongly advise to play with 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.700
 ghosts which will allow you to be 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.720
 invisible because good when we play at 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.640
 shotgun that will really be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.560
 very very close to amy of course so 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.670
 it will have to rock so if you ever 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.170
 do not have a photo but it is likely to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.489
 ask a few minor problems 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.630
 light also prove to be a very 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.430
 good option at the end of the course lightened in 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.959
 the faster we go all three you have the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.519
 choice between extreme conditions or 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.780
 dexterity personally I play them 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.090
 with dexterity which allows him to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 shoot faster after a race 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.940
 really handy in case of glitch 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.890
 it's the guy is really very close to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.180
 we as a whole these two rifles to 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530
 pump there are really interesting to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 to play 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.070
 already a little bit more reliable we're going 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.570
 say that 277 with the 870 knowing that 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.680
 it's a shot against yes but if 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.329
 you never do khalid the first time 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.620
 well you're a little bit in the shit 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.850
 while he accepted the pump the sight 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.110
 that little bourrine is in quotation marks 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.459
 it's much more practical what it 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.860
 must know is that the s12 and semi 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.269
 automatic it takes is similar 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.100
 strikers have the old codes it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.920
 must press to shoot several times 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.570
 and the m doucede is the first rifle to 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.640
 pump that crosses with a cadence 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.829
 like that it's quite special cdu burst 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.510
 that is, he fired four bullets 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.220
 after he's going to rearm so we'll see 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.049
 the animation of the man who will put his 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.489
 hand at the end of the frame and turned 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.709
 slightly the thing in order to rearm the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.390
 loader and then he'll remove four 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.650
 times it's bursts of four bullets 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 which is quite particular with his 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.700
 first pump we see like that on this 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 Well, I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.410
 I make you many kisses and I will 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.410
 say to be
