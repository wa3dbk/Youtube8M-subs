00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
while for it but I mean I think by the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.760 
while for it but I mean I think by the
time<00:03:31.090> he<00:03:31.390> said<00:03:31.600> he'd<00:03:31.690> start<00:03:31.990> you<00:03:32.110> know<00:03:32.260> had<00:03:32.620> me

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
time he said he'd start you know had me

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.410 
time he said he'd start you know had me
in<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> system<00:03:33.430> or<00:03:33.580> had<00:03:33.730> me<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:33.940> line<00:03:34.150> or

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
in the system or had me in line or

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.970 
in the system or had me in line or
whatever<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.750> think<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.050> might<00:03:35.500> have<00:03:35.620> been<00:03:35.710> two

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
whatever I think it might have been two

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.250 
whatever I think it might have been two
maybe<00:03:36.640> three<00:03:37.000> months<00:03:37.180> something<00:03:37.960> like<00:03:38.050> that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
maybe three months something like that

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.850 
maybe three months something like that
but<00:03:38.500> for<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.280> quality<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:40.060> mean<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.140> honestly

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
but for the quality I mean and honestly

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.940 
but for the quality I mean and honestly
