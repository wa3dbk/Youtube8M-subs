00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
never win a neighborhood if you have
windows<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.700> haven't<00:02:02.909> been<00:02:02.969> replaced<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.570> 20

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
windows that haven't been replaced in 20

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.920 
windows that haven't been replaced in 20
15<00:02:04.590> 30<00:02:05.280> years<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> time<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
15 30 years which a lot of the time to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.749 
15 30 years which a lot of the time to
lower-income<00:02:07.320> neighborhoods<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.520> not

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
lower-income neighborhoods they have not

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
lower-income neighborhoods they have not
the<00:02:09.330> homeowners<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:09.869> haven't<00:02:10.410> got<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.739> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the homeowners just haven't got you to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.040 
the homeowners just haven't got you to
it<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.310> would<00:02:11.640> say<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.940> isn't<00:02:12.270> Sofia<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it I would say that isn't Sofia just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.500 
it I would say that isn't Sofia just
because<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
because you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.940 
because you
live<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:13.900> you're<00:02:14.049> not<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.769> it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
live there you're not going to do it

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.009 
live there you're not going to do it
because<00:02:15.430> if<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.819> keep<00:02:16.000> those<00:02:16.269> crappy<00:02:16.659> windows

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
because if you keep those crappy windows

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.600 
because if you keep those crappy windows
it<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.349> only<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.799> not<00:02:17.980> protecting<00:02:18.519> your

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
it not only is it not protecting your

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.179 
it not only is it not protecting your
investment<00:02:19.329> you<00:02:19.810> will<00:02:20.079> help<00:02:20.319> long<00:02:20.500> term<00:02:20.769> costs

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
investment you will help long term costs

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.309 
investment you will help long term costs
and<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.269> will<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.510> paying<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:22.780> these<00:02:22.989> costs

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
and you will be paying for these costs

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.619 
and you will be paying for these costs
on<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.560> back<00:02:23.739> end<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.549> by<00:02:24.760> one<00:02:24.790> they<00:02:25.450> just

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
on the back end as one by one they just

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.119 
on the back end as one by one they just
causes<00:02:25.959> way<00:02:26.110> more<00:02:26.349> headaches<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:26.739> they<00:02:26.950> were

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
causes way more headaches than they were

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.530 
causes way more headaches than they were
especially<00:02:27.730> if<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.360> worry<00:02:28.510> about

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
especially if you have to worry about

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.559 
especially if you have to worry about
lead<00:02:28.870> paint<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.620> end<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.269> when<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.360> comes

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
lead paint in the end like when it comes

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.259 
lead paint in the end like when it comes
to<00:02:31.810> roof<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.980> should<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:33.730> obvious

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
to roof this should probably be obvious

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.759 
to roof this should probably be obvious
but<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.900> lot<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.260> these<00:02:35.440> low-income

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
but a lot of these low-income

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.199 
but a lot of these low-income
neighborhoods<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.670> very<00:02:36.909> hit<00:02:37.090> or<00:02:37.120> miss

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
neighborhoods it's a very hit or miss

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.030 
neighborhoods it's a very hit or miss
the<00:02:37.420> police's<00:02:38.019> have<00:02:38.200> been<00:02:38.349> replaced<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the police's have been replaced it's the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.380 
the police's have been replaced it's the
last<00:02:39.250> thing<00:02:39.370> those<00:02:39.640> homeowners<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.299> these

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
last thing those homeowners in these

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.899 
last thing those homeowners in these
areas<00:02:40.810> have<00:02:41.500> done<00:02:41.769> because<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.340> costs<00:02:42.579> a<00:02:42.700> lot

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
areas have done because it costs a lot

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.849 
areas have done because it costs a lot
of<00:02:42.970> money<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> would<00:02:44.290> say<00:02:44.530> if<00:02:44.709> you're

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
of money but I would say if you're

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.319 
of money but I would say if you're
looking<00:02:45.250> up<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.519> roof<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.060> looks<00:02:46.209> like

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
looking up the roof and it looks like

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.729 
looking up the roof and it looks like
it's<00:02:46.510> gonna<00:02:46.629> give<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.900> any<00:02:47.170> problems<00:02:47.590> within

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
it's gonna give you any problems within

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.250 
it's gonna give you any problems within
the<00:02:47.890> next<00:02:48.069> two<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.370> three<00:02:48.670> years<00:02:48.970> even<00:02:49.810> five

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
the next two to three years even five

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.259 
the next two to three years even five
years<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.829> would<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.310> replace<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.940> not<00:02:52.150> only

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
years I would just replace it not only

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.240 
years I would just replace it not only
does<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.540> protect<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:53.200> investment

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
does it protect your investment

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.940 
does it protect your investment
but<00:02:54.760> leaky<00:02:55.389> roofs<00:02:55.720> are<00:02:55.870> not<00:02:56.109> okay<00:02:56.530> with<00:02:56.799> your

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
but leaky roofs are not okay with your

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
but leaky roofs are not okay with your
tenants<00:02:57.489> if<00:02:57.879> you<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.180> have<00:02:58.299> leaking<00:02:58.629> roofs<00:02:58.840> you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
tenants if you do have leaking roofs you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.330 
tenants if you do have leaking roofs you
might<00:02:59.109> get<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> great<00:02:59.530> tenant<00:02:59.859> that's<00:03:00.010> going<00:03:00.250> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
might get a great tenant that's going to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.069 
might get a great tenant that's going to
leave<00:03:00.459> early<00:03:00.879> because<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.420> won't<00:03:01.540> fix<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
leave early because you won't fix the

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.500 
leave early because you won't fix the
roof<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.069> say<00:03:03.310> replace<00:03:03.609> versus<00:03:04.120> repair

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
roof and I say replace versus repair

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420 
roof and I say replace versus repair
because<00:03:04.810> replacing<00:03:05.409> is<00:03:05.560> only<00:03:05.709> something<00:03:06.069> that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
because replacing is only something that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.550 
because replacing is only something that
we<00:03:07.030> add<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.079> every<00:03:08.260> single

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
we add it up and you do it every single

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.740 
we add it up and you do it every single
year<00:03:08.739> well<00:03:09.549> we<00:03:09.730> will<00:03:09.819> pay<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.269> than<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.569> cost

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
year well we will pay more than the cost

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.410 
year well we will pay more than the cost
of<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:10.989> replacing<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.769> upfront<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.760> don't

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
of just replacing it upfront I don't

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.119 
of just replacing it upfront I don't
think<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.750> should<00:03:13.959> be<00:03:14.139> a<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:14.680> not<00:03:14.739> gonna

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
think that should be a I'm not gonna

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.229 
think that should be a I'm not gonna
live<00:03:15.340> there<00:03:15.459> I'm<00:03:15.579> not<00:03:15.700> going<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.970> do<00:03:16.120> it

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
live there I'm not going to do it

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.399 
live there I'm not going to do it
because<00:03:16.389> you<00:03:16.629> always<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.109> normally

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
because you always have to normally

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.199 
because you always have to normally
think<00:03:17.620> about<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.919> tenant<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:18.489> even<00:03:18.790> more<00:03:19.000> so

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
think about the tenant but even more so

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.280 
think about the tenant but even more so
above<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.349> longevity<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:21.430> your

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
above that the longevity of your

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.210 
above that the longevity of your
investment<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.560> when<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.769> get<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:23.919> roof

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
investment and when you get a roof

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.409 
investment and when you get a roof
you're<00:03:24.459> not<00:03:24.609> gonna<00:03:24.699> get<00:03:24.879> all<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.090> water

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
you're not gonna get all that water

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.509 
you're not gonna get all that water
damage<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.019> does<00:03:26.470> cost<00:03:26.769> so<00:03:26.980> much<00:03:27.099> money<00:03:27.310> and

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
damage that does cost so much money and

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.189 
damage that does cost so much money and
just<00:03:27.669> so<00:03:27.879> much<00:03:28.000> internal<00:03:28.359> down<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:28.900> not<00:03:29.019> just

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
just so much internal down it's not just

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
with the newer one so all the technology

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.540 
with the newer one so all the technology
that<00:04:22.630> goes<00:04:22.690> into<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.229> just<00:04:23.950> helps<00:04:24.250> defray

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
about a couple hundred dollars however

going to have to constantly replace so
it's<00:05:42.700> definitely<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.270> good<00:05:43.510> thing<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.900> do<00:05:44.110> this

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
it's definitely a good thing to do this

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.920 
it's definitely a good thing to do this
is<00:05:45.040> something<00:05:45.520> where<00:05:45.640> if<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.360> say<00:05:46.570> I'm<00:05:46.870> not

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
is something where if you say I'm not

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.310 
is something where if you say I'm not
going<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.560> live<00:05:47.770> in<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.040> that's<00:05:48.310> okay<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:50.080> not

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
going to live in it that's okay to not

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.650 
going to live in it that's okay to not
do<00:05:50.770> necessarily<00:05:51.400> an<00:05:51.490> upgrade<00:05:51.850> from<00:05:52.030> vinyl<00:05:52.450> to

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
do necessarily an upgrade from vinyl to

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.470 
do necessarily an upgrade from vinyl to
tile<00:05:53.230> however<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.340> would<00:05:54.670> just<00:05:54.790> recommend<00:05:54.970> it

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
tile however I would just recommend it

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.910 
tile however I would just recommend it
so<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.660> think<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.050> one<00:05:56.320> case<00:05:56.650> it's

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
so I think in that one case it's

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.830 
so I think in that one case it's
probably<00:05:57.130> okay<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:57.880> then<00:05:57.970> some<00:05:58.210> few<00:05:58.480> others

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
probably okay and then some few others

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.240 
probably okay and then some few others
you<00:05:59.560> definitely<00:06:01.590> can<00:06:02.590> get<00:06:02.710> away<00:06:02.800> with<00:06:03.100> that

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
you definitely can get away with that

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.370 
you definitely can get away with that
and<00:06:03.310> not<00:06:03.700> necessarily<00:06:04.540> have<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:04.750> really<00:06:05.170> bad

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
and not necessarily have a really bad

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.020 
and not necessarily have a really bad
tenant<00:06:05.860> experience<00:06:06.580> or<00:06:06.880> not<00:06:07.570> have<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:08.080> really

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
tenant experience or not have it really

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.240

cause any type of long-term maintenance

and<00:06:27.670> I<00:06:27.970> would<00:06:28.120> just<00:06:28.270> suggest<00:06:28.420> it<00:06:28.840> just<00:06:29.050> because

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
and I would just suggest it just because

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.170 
and I would just suggest it just because
not<00:06:29.470> only<00:06:29.530> does<00:06:29.770> it<00:06:29.920> glam<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.340> place<00:06:30.550> up<00:06:30.850> for<00:06:30.880> a

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
not only does it glam the place up for a

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.150 
not only does it glam the place up for a
relatively<00:06:31.690> low<00:06:32.050> cost<00:06:32.080> because<00:06:32.800> you<00:06:32.830> can<00:06:33.040> get

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
relatively low cost because you can get

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.010 
relatively low cost because you can get

it back in the kitchen done for about

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.680 
it back in the kitchen done for about
four<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.800> five<00:06:35.830> hundred<00:06:36.220> dollars<00:06:36.790> per<00:06:37.330> floor

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
four to five hundred dollars per floor

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.360 
four to five hundred dollars per floor
it<00:06:38.020> doesn't

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
it doesn't

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.950 
it doesn't
to<00:06:38.460> be<00:06:38.550> that<00:06:38.729> much<00:06:38.910> by<00:06:39.120> very<00:06:39.389> experienced

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
to be that much by very experienced

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.610 
to be that much by very experienced
tyler's<00:06:41.419> but<00:06:42.419> I<00:06:42.720> would<00:06:43.080> think<00:06:43.199> it's<00:06:43.410> just

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
tyler's but I would think it's just

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.310 
tyler's but I would think it's just
worth<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:43.979> just<00:06:44.040> because<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.699> how<00:06:45.300> the<00:06:46.169> to

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
worth it just because of how the to

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.170 
worth it just because of how the to
point<00:06:46.680> you<00:06:46.740> get<00:06:46.889> from<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.280> upgrade<00:06:47.699> look<00:06:47.940> a

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
point you get from the upgrade look a

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.210 
point you get from the upgrade look a
relatively<00:06:48.810> low<00:06:49.110> price<00:06:49.410> to<00:06:49.680> get<00:06:49.830> it<00:06:49.919> installed

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
relatively low price to get it installed

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.400 
relatively low price to get it installed
as<00:06:50.850> well<00:06:51.030> as<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.270> long<00:06:51.449> lasting<00:06:51.690> maintenance

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
as well as the long lasting maintenance

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.980 
as well as the long lasting maintenance
call<00:06:52.650> so<00:06:53.100> this<00:06:53.729> is<00:06:53.940> part<00:06:54.240> two<00:06:54.449> of<00:06:54.479> the<00:06:54.780> series
