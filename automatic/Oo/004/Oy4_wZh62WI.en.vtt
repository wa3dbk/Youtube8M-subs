cardio sequence 1.0 and 2.0 and today
we're<00:00:46.979> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.159> talk<00:00:47.309> about<00:00:47.339> something<00:00:47.820> can

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we're going to talk about something can

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
we're going to talk about something can
be<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.330> little<00:00:48.659> more<00:00:48.870> controversial<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> was

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be a little more controversial and I was

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.460 
be a little more controversial and I was
very<00:00:50.070> skeptical<00:00:50.580> about<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.059> method<00:00:51.960> called

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
very skeptical about this method called

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.969 
very skeptical about this method called
ab<00:00:52.680> targeted<00:00:53.610> cardio<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.390> basically<00:00:55.379> what

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
ab targeted cardio now basically what

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.979 
ab targeted cardio now basically what
this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.339> about<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:57.000> blood<00:00:57.420> flow<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this is about is about blood flow and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.500 
this is about is about blood flow and
how<00:00:58.199> blood<00:00:58.530> flow<00:00:58.830> relates<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> fat<00:00:59.729> loss<00:00:59.760> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
how blood flow relates to fat loss so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.119 
how blood flow relates to fat loss so
I've<00:01:01.019> read<00:01:01.229> in<00:01:01.320> reading<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> research

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
I've read in reading a lot of research

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.380 
I've read in reading a lot of research
over<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.339> last<00:01:02.400> couple<00:01:02.790> years<00:01:02.850> about<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
over the last couple years about this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.289 
over the last couple years about this
from<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.809> guy<00:01:03.960> named<00:01:04.559> Lyle<00:01:04.920> McDonald<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> like

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
from a guy named Lyle McDonald so I like

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.460 
from a guy named Lyle McDonald so I like
to<00:01:06.330> give<00:01:06.479> credit<00:01:06.780> where<00:01:06.870> credit<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.200> due

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to give credit where credit is due

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
to give credit where credit is due
Lyles<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.460> man<00:01:08.610> he<00:01:09.270> breaks<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.690> all<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
Lyles the man he breaks down all the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
Lyles the man he breaks down all the
science<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:11.220> simplify<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.060> people

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
science I can simplify it for people

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
science I can simplify it for people
like<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.110> learn<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> apply<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
like you so you can learn to apply it so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.530 
like you so you can learn to apply it so
here's<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:14.640> works<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.090> basically

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here's how it works you're basically

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.720 
here's how it works you're basically
going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.170> same<00:01:16.410> exact<00:01:16.830> sequence<00:01:17.130> as

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
going to use the same exact sequence as

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.380 
going to use the same exact sequence as
the<00:01:18.210> ultimate<00:01:18.600> cardio<00:01:19.110> sequence<00:01:19.560> 1.0<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.430> 2.0

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the ultimate cardio sequence 1.0 and 2.0

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.290 
the ultimate cardio sequence 1.0 and 2.0
but<00:01:21.990> during<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.100> five-minute<00:01:23.700> rest<00:01:23.940> instead

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
but during your five-minute rest instead

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300 
but during your five-minute rest instead
of<00:01:24.510> resting<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.230> gonna<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:25.950> an<00:01:26.070> AB

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of resting you're gonna go into an AB

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
of resting you're gonna go into an AB
circuit<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> reason<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
circuit and the reason that you want to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.900 
circuit and the reason that you want to
do<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.410> because<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> 1/2

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
do this is because when you do a 1/2

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.540 
do this is because when you do a 1/2
circuit<00:01:30.360> after<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.650> short<00:01:32.100> hard

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
circuit after you do your short hard

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.760 
circuit after you do your short hard
metabolic<00:01:33.420> burst<00:01:33.690> remember<00:01:34.080> those<00:01:34.200> sprints

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
metabolic burst remember those sprints

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
metabolic burst remember those sprints
or<00:01:35.130> those<00:01:35.280> bursts<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> last

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
or those bursts and want them to last

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.340 
or those bursts and want them to last
between<00:01:37.200> 10<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.070> 30<00:01:38.730> seconds<00:01:39.360> ideally<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
between 10 and 30 seconds ideally so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.900 
between 10 and 30 seconds ideally so
that<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.620> can<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:40.980> bit<00:01:41.220> harder<00:01:41.760> than

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
that you can go a little bit harder than

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.970 
that you can go a little bit harder than
if<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> wasn't<00:01:42.510> interval<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.680> once<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
if it wasn't interval okay so once you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.370 
if it wasn't interval okay so once you
finish<00:01:44.250> those<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> remember<00:01:45.960> main<00:01:46.110> force

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
finish those and you remember main force

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
finish those and you remember main force
the<00:01:46.590> release<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.430> fat<00:01:47.670> burning

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the release of all those fat burning

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.630 
the release of all those fat burning
hormones<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.830> body's<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> perfect

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
hormones now your body's in a perfect

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
hormones now your body's in a perfect
position<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:51.150> create<00:01:51.420> blood<00:01:51.720> flow<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
position to create blood flow to the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.430 
position to create blood flow to the
stomach<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.190> immediately<00:01:53.460> go

sense<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.250> your<00:03:33.640> body<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.090> now<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.660> target

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
sense that your body is now in a target

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.410 
sense that your body is now in a target
the<00:03:35.380> free<00:03:35.590> fatty<00:03:35.859> acids<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> stomach<00:03:37.180> area

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the free fatty acids in the stomach area

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.060 
the free fatty acids in the stomach area
and<00:03:37.870> you'll<00:03:38.019> stack<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.560> deck<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.920> your<00:03:38.950> favor

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
and you'll stack the deck in your favor

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.099 
and you'll stack the deck in your favor
now<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.329> couple<00:03:40.540> warnings<00:03:40.989> about

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
now I do have a couple warnings about

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.229 
now I do have a couple warnings about
this<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.980> first<00:03:42.160> one<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.790> number<00:03:43.120> one

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
this the first one is is the number one

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.370 
this the first one is is the number one
you're<00:03:43.390> not<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.750> see<00:03:43.870> results<00:03:44.260> with

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
you're not going to see results with

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.110 
you're not going to see results with
this<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.739> aren't<00:03:44.920> lean<00:03:45.070> like<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.400> said<00:03:45.640> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
this if you aren't lean like I said the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.250 
this if you aren't lean like I said the
second<00:03:46.480> thing<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.810> want<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.049> warn<00:03:47.200> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
second thing that I want to warn you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.170 
second thing that I want to warn you
about<00:03:47.410> with<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.730> fact<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
about with this is the fact that you

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.940 
about with this is the fact that you
could<00:03:49.420> fall<00:03:49.660> victim<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.079> what<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.320> call<00:03:50.590> time

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
could fall victim to what I call time

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.870 
could fall victim to what I call time
under<00:03:51.340> tension

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
under tension

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.030 
under tension
now<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.450> caution<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.530> for<00:03:53.709> cardio

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
now I caution you for this for cardio

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.979 
now I caution you for this for cardio
because<00:03:54.250> what<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.700> will<00:03:54.880> do<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.959> will

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
because what this will do is it will

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.830 
because what this will do is it will
actually<00:03:56.320> create<00:03:56.739> more<00:03:57.519> muscle<00:03:57.970> bulk<00:03:58.299> then<00:03:58.750> it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
actually create more muscle bulk then it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.449 
actually create more muscle bulk then it
will<00:03:59.019> fat<00:03:59.320> burning<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.829> a<00:03:59.859> whole<00:04:00.100> goal<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
will fat burning and a whole goal of

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.280 
will fat burning and a whole goal of
cardio<00:04:00.850> is<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.150> burn<00:04:01.359> fat<00:04:01.690> not<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.079> build

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
cardio is to burn fat not to build

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.170 
cardio is to burn fat not to build
muscle<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:03.190> what<00:04:03.310> happens<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.850> lot<00:04:04.060> of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
muscle and what happens is a lot of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.699 
muscle and what happens is a lot of
people<00:04:04.390> will<00:04:04.540> use<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.810> lateral<00:04:05.079> resistance

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
people will use the lateral resistance

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.069 
people will use the lateral resistance
when<00:04:06.250> they<00:04:06.340> do<00:04:06.400> study<00:04:06.730> state<00:04:07.000> cardio<00:04:07.299> and<00:04:07.870> I'm

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
when they do study state cardio and I'm

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.479 
when they do study state cardio and I'm
going<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.290> recommend<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.920> pull<00:04:09.340> away

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
going to recommend that you pull away

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.130 
going to recommend that you pull away
from<00:04:09.819> using<00:04:10.000> resistance<00:04:10.660> no<00:04:10.840> matter<00:04:10.989> what

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
from using resistance no matter what

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.900 
from using resistance no matter what
type<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.470> exercise<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.250> during<00:04:12.609> steady

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
type of exercise it is during steady

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.000 
type of exercise it is during steady
state<00:04:13.180> cardio<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.870> want<00:04:14.319> you<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.470> focus<00:04:14.769> more<00:04:14.950> on

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
state cardio I want you to focus more on

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.569 
state cardio I want you to focus more on
speed<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:16.600> rpms<00:04:17.320> rather<00:04:17.680> than<00:04:17.889> resistance<00:04:18.459> you

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
speed or rpms rather than resistance you

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.680 
speed or rpms rather than resistance you
see<00:04:18.729> if<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.940> start<00:04:19.120> cranking

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
see if you start cranking

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.780 
see if you start cranking
way<00:04:19.840> on<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> step<00:04:20.380> mill<00:04:20.650> or<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.920> stair<00:04:21.310> stepper

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
way on a step mill or a stair stepper

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.640 
way on a step mill or a stair stepper
with<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> lot<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.480> resistance<00:04:22.780> for<00:04:23.200> study<00:04:23.410> state

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
with a lot of resistance for study state

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.740 
with a lot of resistance for study state
cardio<00:04:23.890> you're<00:04:24.790> basically<00:04:25.240> doing<00:04:25.480> what's

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
cardio you're basically doing what's

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.060 
cardio you're basically doing what's
called<00:04:25.810> time<00:04:26.170> under<00:04:26.410> tension<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.920> can

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
called time under tension you can

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.440 
called time under tension you can
potentially<00:04:27.310> be<00:04:27.610> bulking<00:04:28.000> up<00:04:28.120> those<00:04:28.270> muscles

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
potentially be bulking up those muscles

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.750 
potentially be bulking up those muscles
rather<00:04:29.080> than<00:04:29.440> burning<00:04:30.040> fat<00:04:30.280> remember<00:04:30.670> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
rather than burning fat remember the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.970 
rather than burning fat remember the
whole<00:04:30.910> goal<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:32.020> burn<00:04:32.230> stubborn

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
whole goal of this is to burn stubborn

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.340 
whole goal of this is to burn stubborn
fat<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.850> because<00:04:34.420> there<00:04:34.600> was<00:04:34.690> such<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.870> large

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
fat so because there was such a large

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.560 
fat so because there was such a large
demand<00:04:35.830> for<00:04:36.010> everybody<00:04:36.430> wondering<00:04:36.820> how<00:04:37.030> often

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
demand for everybody wondering how often

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.100 
demand for everybody wondering how often
should<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.870> do

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
should I do

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.880 
should I do
1.0<00:04:39.100> 2.0<00:04:39.850> or<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:40.510> new<00:04:40.720> ab<00:04:40.930> targeted<00:04:41.530> cardio
