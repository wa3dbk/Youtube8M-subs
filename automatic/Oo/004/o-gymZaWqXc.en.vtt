00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:13.399
 the goal 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.419
 the request 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.919
 - it's obvious that I've formed the man so far as the video 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.919
 meticulously organize my second skin 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.159
 not 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.419
 Let's get down to business now and we're thinking about how this happened. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.320
 now with any other government 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 my people a month my god 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 Why do you wear the Flemish shirt? Almost everything. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 - a common thing 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 a fan so uttered here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.070
 until that day it is not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.790
 battisti 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.550
 the flamenguistas only speak 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.040
 but let's stop smoking - the football way 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 of the universe 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 hugo 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.520
 the tradition men were very large 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.930
 sporting 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.160
 my father spoke on the phone trainer of athletes champions of people who 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.140
 Brazil lives in Flemish 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 did it hurt 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 we have to enjoy the last days of life starving 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 everything close to 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.660
 the goal of the hill is where the goal 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.410
 paulo the goal 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.000
 I what I see today I shiver 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.580
 inside 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.200
 unforgettable 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 it was absurd 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.530
 Why did not this happen? 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.440
 It's the opportunity I had to be able to 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.590
 celebrate the title 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.490
 that comes his last title the Flemish 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 it's a special game 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.509
 with cds made things 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
 It seems that moment all year long. 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.479
 and I think there's a mystical month of November 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.029
 - if you play as if you want to see if you can handle it over the phone 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
 I speak with santo antÃ´nio 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.369
 the surveys I helped create this space
