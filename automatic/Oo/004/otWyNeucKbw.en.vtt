00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
get kind of takes a little bit of time

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.830 
get kind of takes a little bit of time
getting<00:02:01.259> adjusted<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:02.030> using<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.299> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
getting adjusted to using it there so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
getting adjusted to using it there so
let's<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.200> powder<00:02:04.409> song<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.920> talk<00:02:05.100> talk<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
let's have powder song just talk talk to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
let's have powder song just talk talk to
you<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> advice

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you more a little bit about the advice

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.119 
you more a little bit about the advice
here<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.759> powered<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.360> 1<00:02:09.720> gigahertz

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
here so it's powered by a 1 gigahertz

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.520 
here so it's powered by a 1 gigahertz
nvidia<00:02:11.129> tegra<00:02:11.370> 2<00:02:11.700> dual<00:02:12.150> core<00:02:12.420> processor<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.410> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
nvidia tegra 2 dual core processor so it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.850 
nvidia tegra 2 dual core processor so it
should

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
should

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
should
make<00:02:13.950> stuff<00:02:14.160> fly<00:02:14.430> very<00:02:14.670> quickly<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.990> it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
make stuff fly very quickly it's a it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.620
