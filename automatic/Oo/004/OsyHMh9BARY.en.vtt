00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.610
 in the new zombie mechanics of the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.800
 last version that has been released 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.020

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.910
 and let's say that in this video I'm going to 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.320
 explain not all the changes and all 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.270
 the different things that have been applied 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.620
 in our new version so a guys 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.130
 I hope you like to give light is

 this chair and see you later 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.320
 first of all let's talk about the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 zombie villagers that comprise 5% of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.790
 all zombies generated by what 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 general these behave like zombies 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.690
 normal but the head and face its 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.310
 power the character remembers that of a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.560
 peasant especially in the nose 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.180
 pronounced they have and the testers 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.030
 of zombies can occur in the modes of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 Normal easy game difficult or hardcore 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.549
 the zombie villagers can but not always 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.859
 be the result of attacks by 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.689
 zombie ordinary villagers if any 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.250
 type of zombie kills a villager there 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.950
 the possibility that the villager will 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.240
 transform into a 100 zombie villager by 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.819
 hundred chance in mode 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 difficult 50% probability in conditions 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.200
 normal and 0 percent probability 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.149
 in easy and pacified this happens to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.130
 often during the sieges the villagers 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.750
 tommy can be cured by throwing a 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.429
 weakness splash potion 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.140
 then they are given a golden apple giving 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.869
 Right click on the video yesterday 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.579
 zombie with the strong whistle he 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.989
 listen and if the bayern succeeds 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.610
 zombie begins to shake the 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:45.860
 transformation takes between two and five 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.049
 minutes while the winner transforms 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.610
 the zombie will continue to attack and must be 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.099
 protected from other attacks and damage 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.500
 solar while the zombie heals itself 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.840
 gives you strength on normal difficulty or 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.280
 force 2 on difficult difficulty so 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.509
 which is more important to extract the zombie 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.509
 if you can not do it little 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.820
 information to take into account the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 Cured villagers do not keep the same 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.900
 commercial objects that they had before 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.240
 who will get infected if the zombie villager 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 used swords or other utensils and 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.510
 I had some kind of armor fitted 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.880
 these elements disappear when the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.040
 villager is cured during the process 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.720
 cured in keeping the zombie villager 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 away from other zombies because if not the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.560
 other zombies undertake the process of 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.950
 cured on the other hand in version 1.6 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.630
 added the baby villager zombies that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.940
 they create by infecting a village 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.440
 do not drink the possibility of infection are 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.660
 the same as the standard villagers 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.130
 zombies they are the same as 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
 regular zombies with the following 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.990
 peculiarities do not burn when they are 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.209
 exposed to the sun they do not grow to no 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.570
 to be cured of the same method 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.390
 how the zombies villagers are cured 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.370
 normal when they wear the armor or 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.980
 collect shrinks to fit your size 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.480
 body they are able to climb 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.470
 stairs in spite of other zombies that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.880
 they are not 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.410
 unlike adults are my 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.060
 zombies respond to attacks 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.489
 even when they are attacking something else 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 that means that if a small zombie 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.830
 is attacking for example a spider and I 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.900
 suddenly starts to take off 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.780
 the directly rotate and begin 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.160
 attacking me finally are very many 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.160
 faster than the other modes 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 when they are eliminated the zombies loose 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.220
 0 to 2 pieces of meat could these 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.470
 they can be eaten by the player but 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.209
 have an 80% chance to give a 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.590
 investigation to the meat player 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.420
 rotten can be used with 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 safety to heal and raise wolves 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.100
 diego tamed and that the wolf 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.110
 poison the zombies rarely release 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.060
 iron ingots carrots and potatoes 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.100
 if zombie don is generated with a sword 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 shovel or armor there is a small 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.880
 possibility of dropping one or more 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.040
 of these items this is one of the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.350
 two legitimate ways to get the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.010
 incredible chain armor in mode 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.260
 survival 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.709
 the ode would be through negotiation with 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.709
 a blacksmith 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.980
