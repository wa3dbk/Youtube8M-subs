pull her straight back and let's see

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.200 
pull her straight back and let's see
what<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.840> looks<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.500> faster

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
what that looks like a little bit faster

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
what that looks like a little bit faster
I've<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> Coppa<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.140> I've<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.500> left

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I've got the Coppa and I've got my left

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.349 
I've got the Coppa and I've got my left
hand<00:00:56.039> getting<00:00:56.789> ready<00:00:56.969> left<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.899> her<00:00:58.050> left<00:00:59.359> for

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
hand getting ready left to her left for

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.660 
hand getting ready left to her left for
that<00:01:00.449> reverse<00:01:00.840> wrap<00:01:01.879> blocking<00:01:03.379> pulling<00:01:04.379> back

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
that reverse wrap blocking pulling back

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
that reverse wrap blocking pulling back
and<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:06.030> basically<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.479> another<00:01:06.930> wrap

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and that's basically just another wrap

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
and that's basically just another wrap
around<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> world<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.250> another<00:01:08.520> wrap<00:01:09.090> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
around the world into another wrap so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.170 
around the world into another wrap so
we'll<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> whole<00:01:09.630> move<00:01:10.790> well<00:01:11.790> move<00:01:12.000> looks

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we'll do the whole move well move looks
