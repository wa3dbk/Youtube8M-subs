this<00:00:34.770> probably<00:00:35.610> would<00:00:35.820> work<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.300> bit

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this probably would work a little bit

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
this probably would work a little bit
better<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.950> doing

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
better than this but it's it's doing

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.360 
better than this but it's it's doing
okay<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.440> embossing<00:00:40.440> paste<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
okay this embossing paste is the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
okay this embossing paste is the
consistency<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.059> frosting<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:44.059> got<00:00:45.059> my

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
consistency of frosting so i got my

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
consistency of frosting so i got my
frosting<00:00:45.570> knife<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.010> me<00:00:47.160> and
