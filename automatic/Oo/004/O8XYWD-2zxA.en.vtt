00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.769
 Terrace surfaces are daily the burden of man and nature 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 This leaves traces after some time depending on the location and age of the exposed 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.640
 surface 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 we want to show you in this video how easy Meeke and Terraces are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 freshen up again 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.369
 Please also observe the care instructions of the construction manual 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.580
 first use a broom to remove loose dirt from the surface 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 m 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.610
 then spray everything with clear water and leave for a few minutes 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.380
 No 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.380
 now we have to clean the dirt with broom and scrubber 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.790
 This shows the great advantage of wood Bolivia materials 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.820
 Surfaces you will be amazed how easy the patina or large 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.190
 Exert effort 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.460
 every now and then rinse off with water to loose dirt 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 remove 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.070
 For stubborn stains like fat playing in the tent had coal or east 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 repeatedly the biodegradable concentrate developed negatively 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 dilute the liquid with water and spray with Jan Wigger Kiem 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.720
 apply 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 Leave for a short time until it forms foam 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.920
 then, in turn, expose the dirt particles with a scrubber 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
 and play with clear water from the surface 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 Repeat this process several times if necessary 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.900
 Alternatively, you can also remove these stains with a wire brush 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.290
 the brighter places they will be after a few weeks depending on 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 Bring sunlight back into the environment 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.070
 After the surface has dried, it shines again in new splendor 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.100
 this is care and cleaning Liz May Gottlieb of Megawatt
