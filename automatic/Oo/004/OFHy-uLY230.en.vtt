00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 What is it 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 now 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.040
 hello how about all the friends of 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.489
 youtube and well this is this is my new 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.640
 video tutorial and this time I come 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.180
 with what is 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.570
 transformation from windows 7 to windows 8 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.750
 but not only windows 7 but also 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 windows xp way so the transformation 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 serves for windows 7 and windows xp 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.170
 good in the description of the video as 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 you know, I'll leave the download link 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 which are three links the first one that is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.290
 for windows 7 32 bits 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.070
 st this is the one in the second one is for 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.490
 windows 7 64 bits and the last one is for 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.730
 windows xp this serves for any of 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.430
 the two versions ok 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.370
 as an operating system is 32 bits 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.730
 I downloaded the first one 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.940
 Once downloaded, it will appear 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.760
 something like this 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.370
 something like that what we're going to do is if 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.200
 we have windows 7 give you right click and 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.750
 we execute it as administrator 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 and will automatically start loading 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 something like this or to perform the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.969
 changes that we are going to make we must have 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.159
 our windows and so this original without 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.769
 no change if we previously 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.860
 we have made some change just what 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.440
 we undo ok I'm going to go to this 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.709
 windows had several changes and all 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.090
 I undid to be able to do 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.150
 transformation after we do the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.200
 transformation we can do them again 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.450
 the customizations we had ok 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.180
 well I'm not a download this window 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.819
 let's give who says nets we accept 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 the license agreements as always in 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.590
 all installers give in leds 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.570
 I mark here dialing in all 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.080
 these options because I do not think that it 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.930
 install this program let's go here 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 we leave this so all marked we give in 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.160
 install here here they will start the 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.760
 installation of what is the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.340
 the transformation 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.060
 and will obviously ask them when they 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.069
 finish that we must restart the windows 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.069
 so when I touch restart the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.580
 windows I pause and finish the video 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.520
 untill there 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.970
 for good I have to restart it to me 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.570
 also so I'll wait for him to load 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.570
 All this 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.670
 this transformation we can also 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.840
 do in case we want good 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.160
 obviously have windows 8 and do not know 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.780
 it makes it easy to download and install it 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.620
 so if we have installed windows 7 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.760
 we can transform our windows 7 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.450
 for good 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.840
 to read the look of Windows 8 here 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.840
 it is 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.700
 well and here I know it has been completed 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.269
 we are going to give in next and as how I had 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.860
 said will ask us to restart not be 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.370
 worry change, the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.360
 explorer that happens once we 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.120
 let's go to restart and we will appear 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.949
 the explorer so I give to whom 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.949
 says filis ok 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.160
 good friends this once and review 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.020
 our pc our computer 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.319
 will load us something like this 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.910
 this is what always seems good what 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.520
 What we are going to do is click here 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.669
 so that we are removed 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.310
 you know that the most attractive thing that 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.620
 brought windows 8 is the mosaic this that 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.409
 appears every time we start 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.409
 session we can also have that option 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.119
 well here I tell you that once you 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.300
 have applied the changes are not 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.819
 everything will appear immediately 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.979
 to put the theme that comes in windows 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.960
 8 for fable and to be that right in 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.420
 the desk we go where it says 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.450
 personalize 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.680
 and here in the themes already appear 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.470
 these two themes of windows 8 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.610
 which is windows 8 aerial and windows 8 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.210
 a heron light that we are going to choose hero 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.419
 like that is the good guy for 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.680
 foul in the blue windows 8 look already like 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.289
 you can see there is the theme of windows 8 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.040
 and also at the beginning, look at that 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.310
 appears 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.950
 there is no need to move 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.070
 towards each click move the mouse to here 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:55.210
 to appear and as you can see already 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:58.120
 It appeared that here we are also shown 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.700
 this when clicking on the image that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.000
 we have a user 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:08.640
 these options appear to us like 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.640
 to windows 8 to configure 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.750
 I lent my profile this to hibernate 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.710
 to pay and for this I do not know what it is for 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.710
 but good 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.349
 let's see the option that is the 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.349
 mosaic 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.440
 let's wait for it to load 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:37.289
 well here as you can see the most 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:40.069
 attractive that has been able to bring what 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.069
 it's windows 8 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:50.270
 the mosaic now on our desk 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.270
 the images everything is shown here 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.760
 here 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.270
 we can also configure 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.630
 and here pérez 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.220
 we can configure 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.720
 if the week that the program that 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.400
 we want 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.669
 to write 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.440
 all those options that brings windows 8 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.040
 we can do it now in our 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.040
 windows 7 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.550
 I will select the desktop and 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.040
 what 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:26.030
 this is a very good transformation that 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:29.969
 it serves both windows 7 is 64 and 32 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:32.819
 bits for windows xp 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:35.670
 and I liked the transformation and 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:37.590
 I wanted to share it with you 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.470
 and as I had said at the beginning of 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.170
 video we should all do all the 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.300
 changes that we have in our windows 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:48.960
 so that we can realize the 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.760
 normal changes that after 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.160
 we have made the changes we can return 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.230
 to put the customizations that 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.250
 we had before 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.710
