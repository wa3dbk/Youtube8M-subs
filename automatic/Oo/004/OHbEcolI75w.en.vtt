you<00:02:00.240> shoot<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.720> low<00:02:01.050> light<00:02:01.290> handheld<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.280> say

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you shoot in low light handheld that say

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
you shoot in low light handheld that say
you're<00:02:02.700> shooting<00:02:03.060> alive<00:02:03.390> even<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:05.070> need

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you're shooting alive even and you need

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.640 
you're shooting alive even and you need
a<00:02:05.340> fairly<00:02:05.760> wide<00:02:05.940> coverage<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.780> -<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
a fairly wide coverage with me - you

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.800 
a fairly wide coverage with me - you
know<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.830> want<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> show<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.090> crowd<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.630> want

to show the performer you know along

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.770 
to show the performer you know along
with<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.140> his<00:02:13.880> instruments<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:14.970> stuff<00:02:15.240> for

with all his instruments and stuff for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.990 
with all his instruments and stuff for
those<00:02:15.989> things<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:17.010> generally<00:02:17.489> carrying

your tripod to the you know live show

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.810 
your tripod to the you know live show
maybe<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.780> at<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.230> time<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.860> low-light<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
maybe so at that time in low-light to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
face is gonna tell along and it's well

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.670 
face is gonna tell along and it's well
quite<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.220> close<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.580> about<00:02:29.989> kilo<00:02:30.989> just

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
quite have it's close to about kilo just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.310 
quite have it's close to about kilo just
about<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.220> similar<00:02:32.640> way<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.209> 14<00:02:33.660> 24<00:02:34.140> mm

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
about the similar way to the 14 24 mm

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.970 
about the similar way to the 14 24 mm
that<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.680> call<00:02:34.980> health<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.600> starts<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.769> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that we call health and it starts just a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.810 
that we call health and it starts just a
1<00:02:38.610> mm<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.540> starts<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.110> 15<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.550> it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
1 mm now it starts for 15 but then it

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.840 
1 mm now it starts for 15 but then it
goes<00:02:42.120> about<00:02:42.750> 6<00:02:43.230> mm<00:02:43.500> longer<00:02:43.980> at<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> telephoto

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
goes about 6 mm longer at the telephoto

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.229 
goes about 6 mm longer at the telephoto
he'll<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.690> nikon<00:02:46.110> 1<00:02:46.260> finishes<00:02:46.560> at<00:02:46.890> foot<00:02:47.160> 24<00:02:47.730> mm

he'll the nikon 1 finishes at foot 24 mm
this<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.170> goes<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.980> 30<00:02:50.370> mm<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.790> if<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
this one goes up to 30 mm so if you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.960 
this one goes up to 30 mm so if you
start<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> almost<00:02:53.190> widest<00:02:53.760> em

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
start at right at the almost widest em

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.840 
start at right at the almost widest em
is<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> absolute<00:02:55.019> widest<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.549> still

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
is not the absolute widest but you still

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.509 
is not the absolute widest but you still
give<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.390> great<00:02:57.750> brains<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.560> go<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.799> 30<00:02:59.130> mm

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
give a great brains you go to 30 mm

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.539 
give a great brains you go to 30 mm
which<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.790> very<00:03:00.000> close<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.480> 35<00:03:01.079> mm<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.280> lot<00:03:02.519> of

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
which is very close to 35 mm that lot of

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.850 
which is very close to 35 mm that lot of
people<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.720> know<00:03:03.750> use<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.290> primes<00:03:04.590> for

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
people you know use the primes for

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.770 
people you know use the primes for
that's<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> 3

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
that's a 3

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.530 
that's a 3
I<00:03:05.840> mean<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.680> goes<00:03:06.890> from<00:03:07.069> any<00:03:07.459> wipe<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> not

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
I mean so it goes from any wipe to a not

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.949 
I mean so it goes from any wipe to a not
so<00:03:08.780> white<00:03:08.990> point<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.090> where<00:03:11.090> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
so white point so and that where it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.280 
so white point so and that where it
covers<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.650> great<00:03:13.610> them<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:15.080> does

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
covers a great them and it does

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.870 
covers a great them and it does
not<00:03:15.470> take<00:03:15.620> any<00:03:15.740> filter<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.310> course<00:03:16.550> but<00:03:16.760> it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
not take any filter of course but it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.970 
not take any filter of course but it
comes<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.690> carpet<00:03:18.200> looks<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:18.830> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
comes with the carpet looks but it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.110 
comes with the carpet looks but it
cannot<00:03:19.610> be<00:03:19.790> around<00:03:20.480> here<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.310> also<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.940> can

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
cannot be around here and also it can

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.830 
cannot be around here and also it can
see<00:03:23.300> an<00:03:24.020> best<00:03:24.500> lens<00:03:25.069> hood<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.610> fact<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:26.330> has<00:03:26.630> a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
see an best lens hood in fact it has a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.760 
see an best lens hood in fact it has a
double<00:03:27.319> layer<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.060> whenever<00:03:29.300> you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
double layer on this on and whenever you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.430 
double layer on this on and whenever you
soon<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:31.040> out<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:32.330> can<00:03:32.510> see<00:03:32.780> both<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.080> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
soon this out you can see both of the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.949 
soon this out you can see both of the
layers<00:03:33.680> come<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.730> exactly<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.209> same<00:03:35.239> or<00:03:35.750> not

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
layers come to exactly the same or not

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.900 
layers come to exactly the same or not
there<00:03:36.110> are<00:03:36.170> two<00:03:36.350> reasons<00:03:36.560> for<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.130> number

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
there are two reasons for this number

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.940 
there are two reasons for this number
one<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.360> all<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.930> more<00:03:39.110> minimizes<00:03:39.769> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
one this all the more minimizes the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.120 
one this all the more minimizes the
possible<00:03:40.610> our<00:03:41.150> lens<00:03:41.540> flare<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.019> ghosting<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
possible our lens flare and ghosting and

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.070 
possible our lens flare and ghosting and
the<00:03:43.610> second<00:03:44.000> thing<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.630> course<00:03:44.690> if<00:03:44.989> you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
the second thing is of course if you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.070 
the second thing is of course if you
have<00:03:45.260> coolers<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:45.800> means<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.870> optics<00:03:47.870> here

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
have coolers that means the optics here

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.290 
have coolers that means the optics here
the<00:03:48.290> glass<00:03:48.560> here<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.310> much<00:03:49.580> more<00:03:49.850> secure

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
the glass here is that much more secure

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.840 
the glass here is that much more secure
another<00:03:51.110> useful<00:03:51.350> feature<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.130> lens<00:03:52.459> is

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
another useful feature of this lens is

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.660 
another useful feature of this lens is
the<00:03:53.450> front<00:03:53.750> glasses<00:03:54.350> axiom<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.280> meaning

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the front glasses axiom that meaning

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.610 
the front glasses axiom that meaning
expanded<00:03:56.569> glass<00:03:56.840> more<00:03:57.260> than<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.560> spherical

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
expanded glass more than a spherical

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.240 
expanded glass more than a spherical
lens<00:03:58.100> now<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.519> see<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.680> spherical<00:04:00.680> lense

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
lens now you see this a spherical lense

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.390 
lens now you see this a spherical lense
out<00:04:01.459> there<00:04:01.700> does<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:03.260> circle<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.950> bigger

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
out there does so the circle is bigger

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.509 
out there does so the circle is bigger
than<00:04:04.730> your<00:04:05.480> usual<00:04:05.720> M<00:04:06.380> not<00:04:06.620> our<00:04:06.830> usual<00:04:06.860> spy

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
than your usual M not our usual spy

than your usual M not our usual spy
things

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
things

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.300 
things
means<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.569> it's<00:04:09.840> end<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.409> stairs<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.980> cover

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
means that it's end of stairs to cover

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.240 
means that it's end of stairs to cover
that<00:04:11.610> much<00:04:11.909> more<00:04:12.180> area<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.810> develop<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.620> see

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
that much more area to develop to see

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.759 
that much more area to develop to see
when<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.599> know<00:04:15.720> class<00:04:15.959> comes<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> lab

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
when this you know class comes to a lab

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.759 
when this you know class comes to a lab
but<00:04:17.699> that's<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> good<00:04:18.780> feature<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.320> course<00:04:19.470> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
but that's a good feature of course and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.400 
but that's a good feature of course and
then<00:04:19.949> you<00:04:20.250> also<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.750> they<00:04:21.930> call<00:04:22.139> his<00:04:22.380> a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
then you also have what they call his a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.030 
then you also have what they call his a
fluorine<00:04:22.860> coating<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:23.850> top<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:25.560> if

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
fluorine coating on the top so this if

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.300 
fluorine coating on the top so this if
the<00:04:26.550> pulses<00:04:27.860> water<00:04:28.860> then

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
the pulses water then

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.610 
the pulses water then
dust<00:04:31.910> particle<00:04:32.480> which<00:04:32.660> could<00:04:32.870> be<00:04:33.020> very<00:04:33.320> very

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
dust particle which could be very very

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.129 
dust particle which could be very very
useful<00:04:33.710> because<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:35.120> lens<00:04:35.420> does<00:04:35.570> not<00:04:35.900> make

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
useful because this lens does not make

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.780 
useful because this lens does not make
filter<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.800> Madonna

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
filter a Madonna

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.750 
filter a Madonna
-

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.780 

it<00:04:45.300> absolutely<00:04:45.510> comes<00:04:46.200> clean<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.280> cannot

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
it absolutely comes clean so I cannot

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.010 
it absolutely comes clean so I cannot
say<00:04:48.150> even<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.230> spot<00:04:49.560> on<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.740> absolutely<00:04:51.020> clear

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
say even a spot on it absolutely clear

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.010 
say even a spot on it absolutely clear
and<00:04:52.410> sharp<00:04:52.980> so<00:04:53.820> that's<00:04:54.030> again<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.630> good<00:04:54.810> thing

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
and sharp so that's again a good thing

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.050 
and sharp so that's again a good thing
specially<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:55.980> wide<00:04:56.220> lens<00:04:56.460> may<00:04:56.700> have<00:04:56.850> put

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
specially on a wide lens may have put

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.140 
specially on a wide lens may have put
they<00:04:57.210> do<00:04:57.360> not<00:04:57.510> take<00:04:57.720> filter<00:04:58.310> so<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.430> get<00:04:59.640> you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
they do not take filter so you get you

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.470 
they do not take filter so you get you
know<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.600> can<00:05:01.010> attract<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.040> lot<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.220> dust<00:05:03.180> and

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
know it can attract a lot of dust and

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.820 
know it can attract a lot of dust and
other<00:05:03.690> particles<00:05:03.810> specially<00:05:04.560> when<00:05:04.710> you're

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
other particles specially when you're

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.970 
other particles specially when you're
using<00:05:05.040> it

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
using it

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.480 
using it
the<00:05:07.430> zoom<00:05:07.640> level<00:05:07.850> looks<00:05:08.780> very<00:05:09.530> smooth<00:05:10.010> around

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
the zoom level looks very smooth around

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.350 
the zoom level looks very smooth around
here<00:05:10.910> since<00:05:11.840> 10:30<00:05:12.080> it's<00:05:12.950> made<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.730> metal<00:05:13.760> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
here since 10:30 it's made of metal and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.630 
here since 10:30 it's made of metal and
that's<00:05:14.960> why<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.380> one<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.890> oh<00:05:16.010> wait<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.460> made

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
that's why that one can oh wait so made

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.060 
that's why that one can oh wait so made
of<00:05:16.760> metal<00:05:17.210> meaning<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.350> will<00:05:18.500> also<00:05:18.740> be<00:05:19.040> very

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
of metal meaning it will also be very

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.320 
of metal meaning it will also be very
very<00:05:19.370> durable<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.980> then<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.910> your<00:05:23.090> focus

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
very durable and then that's your focus

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.120 
very durable and then that's your focus
ring<00:05:24.460> now<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:26.330> minimum<00:05:26.660> focus<00:05:27.200> distance<00:05:27.230> is

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
ring now the minimum focus distance is

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.750 
ring now the minimum focus distance is
0.28<00:05:29.030> meter<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.980> ref<00:05:31.070> will<00:05:31.310> close<00:05:31.520> to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
0.28 meter and the ref will close to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.910 
0.28 meter and the ref will close to
infinity<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.750> then<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.320> can<00:05:33.470> see<00:05:33.590> some<00:05:33.800> of

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
infinity and then you can see some of

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.460 
infinity and then you can see some of
the<00:05:34.070> buttons<00:05:34.400> out<00:05:34.700> there<00:05:34.910> so<00:05:35.390> there's<00:05:35.540> MF<00:05:36.290> now

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
the buttons out there so there's MF now

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.910 
the buttons out there so there's MF now
it's<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:37.010> full<00:05:37.340> time<00:05:37.670> manual<00:05:38.060> override<00:05:38.920> that

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
it's a full time manual override that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.070 
it's a full time manual override that

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
meaning evilly from the lens is or body

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.950 
meaning evilly from the lens is or body
focus<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.850> actually<00:05:43.850> manually<00:05:44.360> override

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
focus you can actually manually override

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.230 
focus you can actually manually override
or<00:05:45.080> fine-tune<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.890> focus<00:05:46.310> with<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.910> help<00:05:47.090> of

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
or fine-tune the focus with the help of

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.360 
or fine-tune the focus with the help of
this<00:05:47.420> saga<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.200> thing<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.950> not<00:05:49.160> gonna

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
this saga of the thing you not gonna

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.940 
this saga of the thing you not gonna
spoil<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:50.210> motor<00:05:50.450> of<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.810> lens<00:05:51.170> by<00:05:51.440> doing<00:05:51.740> so

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
spoil the motor of the lens by doing so

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.160 
spoil the motor of the lens by doing so
because<00:05:52.550> although<00:05:52.760> it's<00:05:53.090> does<00:05:53.450> not<00:05:53.630> say<00:05:53.960> that

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
because although it's does not say that

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.900 
because although it's does not say that
manner<00:05:54.440> overhead<00:05:54.890> but<00:05:55.070> this<00:05:55.370> lens<00:05:55.640> actually

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
manner overhead but this lens actually

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.720 
manner overhead but this lens actually
this<00:05:56.630> manual<00:05:57.110> override<00:05:57.560> enabled<00:05:58.130> and<00:05:58.400> then

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
this manual override enabled and then

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.490 
this manual override enabled and then
you<00:05:58.850> know<00:05:58.970> of<00:05:59.030> course<00:05:59.090> we<00:05:59.480> see<00:05:59.720> on<00:05:59.990> or<00:06:00.260> all

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
you know of course we see on or all

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.700 
you know of course we see on or all
single<00:06:01.010> button<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.580> then

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
single button and then

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.700 
single button and then
this<00:06:04.160> is<00:06:04.340> new<00:06:05.180> canon<00:06:05.509> mount<00:06:05.750> so<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:05.930> have<00:06:06.199> the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
this is new canon mount so you have the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.060 
this is new canon mount so you have the
red<00:06:07.000> mark<00:06:08.000> around<00:06:08.300> on<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.199> Nikon<00:06:09.530> mount<00:06:09.800> you

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
red mark around on the Nikon mount you

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.600 
red mark around on the Nikon mount you
have<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:11.120> why

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
have the why

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.600 
have the why
so<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:13.790> for<00:06:14.480> once<00:06:14.750> I<00:06:15.200> said<00:06:15.620> this<00:06:15.830> would<00:06:16.220> truly

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
so then for once I said this would truly

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.750 
so then for once I said this would truly
be<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:17.270> direct<00:06:17.780> competitor<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:18.590> 1424<00:06:19.550> that

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760
