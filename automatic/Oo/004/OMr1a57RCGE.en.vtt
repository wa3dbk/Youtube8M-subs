00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello let them show today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.059
 how to print on thick 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.070
 thick paper on laser printers 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 modern paper feeding systems 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.840
 laser printers then someone specifically on 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 this fury, that is, at first only 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 is taken from below then bends over 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.230
 the drum goes like this and then again 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 bent over and out of the stove that is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 he passes this letter z bends 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.430
 You know the example show that is here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.850
 sheet set bottom 3 times smoke seal 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.620
 send let him take it from the bottom 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 passes here death will serve someone 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.469
 left such a leftist already see 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.500
 bend if you need to print on thick 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.930
 thick paper on many printers 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 this possibility is provided that is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.109
 the first is either here from below 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 here it is recline either here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:12.930
 leans us here but that's tray 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.640
 the holder under the paper that is like this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 install back 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 specifically here on this bustle and there are 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.350
 such a lid that opens then 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.600
 There is now what happens when you print 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.840
 Worms here will take exactly 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.180
 go through the machine and come out back 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.200
 parts let's show it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.140
 There is if this will envelope paper 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.160
 which may not even go through 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.930
 to the device so either after this 2 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 one-time spirit of flexion collapse 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.040
 It is battered pozhuy a look at, and it is necessary 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.960
 use this way that is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.910
 set 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 Click and see what the person will take 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.280
 here we will have this side 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.380
 he went out and that is the minimum 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.170
 deformation of the paper with this type of printing 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 and gives the opportunity to print on paper 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 I know I tried the density of 200 people 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.280
 print even 230 if the paper is not heavy 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.470
 it takes something you need a little help apparatus 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.870
 the device may be old or not at all 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.660
 designed for this should be like this from the side 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.050
 when the paper is taken so neatly her 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.610
 there to crush then she grabs hold 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 maybe even it will be to the end 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.170
 less load on the mechanism 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.959
 which in theory is not designed for printing 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.550
 on such thick paper all if the video 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.530
 turned out to be useful to you like 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.530
 Good luck to all
