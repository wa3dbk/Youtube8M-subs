00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello and welcome to the edition he may do 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.300
 Weekend and the clarification of the world my first attempt with a not quite 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.360
 Officially what happens because of the 15 days separating then you see 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.920
 beautiful 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 all the people suffering from the heat are supposed to be from 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.880
 weekend 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 no longer suffering from her that is now an example of the North 15 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.470
 Days can be for anyone who adheres to the principle 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.009
 this is the one for the season this is the cold record 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.650
 each one up here is the heat record beaten and that is the 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.080
 current forecast at the beginning 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.330
 if the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.150
 Lines the red and the blue and in the middle the division very close together 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.540
 then everything is very safe 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.350
 and you can see it's extremely safe on Saturday for something 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.840
 happened dramatically 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.280
 a graduation made 10 15 degrees of temperature drop in the air 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 which are to be expected so it will be much cooler on the weekend and still 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 of course, this principle is always more exciting in southern Germany 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.510
 or in the Alps 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.740
 because that is a situation where then all go to the mountains and mountain hiking and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.460
 Mountaineering only have sandals on and think 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 it will be on 400 years summer 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
 and then, after that, if the newspaper is a surprise 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.690
 onset of winter 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.360
 we are not quite ready yet depends on how the ki is this 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.260
 Cold air that comes and they are looking straight ahead towards the Alps 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.580
 but a certain uncertainty there we end up here only in the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.610
 average range and there really is in the cold area and that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.820
 then the difference is there a later limit in two parameters or 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.170
 3000 meters 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.540
 Accordingly, it is simply my first warning. Something will happen on the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.040
 Saturday 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.939
 we still do not know exactly how dramatic it is but that's great 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.840
 We can start making money every day and on Wednesday they will 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.870
 also the idea for this thing 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.390
 how bad we are the Kiel cold on Saturday at the moment 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.420
 thus, it is bad but if they mountain similar mountain walks 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.000
 Ascents and ours at the old plan insect on saturday this i believe 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.920
 not the day it will work well, that's it for now 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 but snowing down only when it is completely clouded clouds and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.310
 Ships will be like her, it's not that great either
