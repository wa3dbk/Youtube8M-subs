00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.160
 good from the case the hard and we're 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.099
 on the train in his week number 5 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.730
 and we're going to start with the top 3 as not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.150
 and we have the top 3 looks that we 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 Send to a newtown club on the moon 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.260
 fire as I do not think it's only 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 intensely my wife do not follow by 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 both server I want to know is very 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.929
 intimate when and such but the case is that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.609
 we see how it goes up here you take the 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.769
 manzanita and it starts to sting me with all 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 your classmates this stuff that I can 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.890
 take quick so it's not boring 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 because he asks to apply and apply and itches and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 they do not stop explaining if the nexus remains 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.140
 whole and good , so the manzanita is taken 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 and columns are dumped by contracts 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 that you can not see but I'm telling you that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.719
 she charges us for woman we all have to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.149
 leather craft if you can remove it from the bread 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.340
 of camps point with that up I suppose 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 that I've also spent a lot of time 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 from van dyck to a dot com because this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 as small does not intend to go past click 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 to see thousands action that comes out and super 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 great and that yes that no course I have 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.350
 enough things that I have not put yet 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.509
 many foundations that I have not put then 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 because of lack of quality or because 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.430
 They were bad 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.440
 because this way of putting it then 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.290
 here you see how almost almost the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.130
 excess interest of those 33 points with 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 his partner and they kill them and we are in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 the calculation on the cabbage cock already 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.430
 we are in the top 1 and we are going to see how 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.550
 we have the king of fighters pvp going to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.080
 run to the nexus one but to the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.420
 load first all the people who come 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.220
 or beiges has mine that has the click the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.010
 I know that you're tense kit is called 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 same mine can or not but I know it has 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.430
 the messenger kit because it has more than 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 exploration is the each person that most 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.210
 late don heart more up to berth 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 heart the more you see how it starts to kill 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 all such that queue or sooner 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.380
 your partner to destroy the nexus 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.170
 but as you see here they also start to give 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 this catches he gets put putting 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 porta 22 starts to burst at all 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320
 that come in but one for some serious such 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.759
 which and begins to finish is in those that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 has left his partner without destroying 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.200
 here is how it keeps destroying total 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.700
 letters and begins to break the metal 1234 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 download starts to kill more people 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.849
