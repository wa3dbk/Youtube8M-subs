00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
star it doesn't matter where it is first

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
star it doesn't matter where it is first
word<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:11.159> course<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.080> has<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.350> four

word of course has to has to be four

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
word of course has to has to be four
letters<00:01:13.979> long<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> where<00:01:15.360> game

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
letters long so this is where game

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
letters long so this is where game
starts<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.250> right

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
starts as you can see right right

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.350 
starts as you can see right right
diagonally<00:01:18.780> from<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> star<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
diagonally from that from that star is a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.770 
diagonally from that from that star is a
square<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> says<00:01:22.320> double<00:01:22.799> letter<00:01:23.040> score

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
square that says double letter score

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
square that says double letter score
then<00:01:24.780> diagonally<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.979> triple

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
then diagonally down from that triple

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.060 
then diagonally down from that triple
letter<00:01:26.880> score<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:28.820> double<00:01:29.820> word<00:01:30.210> score

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
letter score and double word score

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.020 
letter score and double word score
now<00:01:32.090> double<00:01:33.090> letter<00:01:33.240> score<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
now double letter score is just that so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.830 
now double letter score is just that so
the<00:01:36.869> tile<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> lands<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.150> square<00:01:39.150> gets

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the tile that lands on this square gets

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.039 
the tile that lands on this square gets
double<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.640> example<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.030> e<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.869> on

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
double so if for example on e was on

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.429 
double so if for example on e was on
that<00:01:43.229> Square<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.070> he's<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> 1<00:01:45.509> value<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that Square and he's a 1 value it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
that Square and he's a 1 value it
becomes<00:01:46.829> 2<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> letter

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
becomes 2 just for a letter

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.160 
becomes 2 just for a letter
same<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:48.960> triple<00:01:49.290> letter<00:01:49.470> score<00:01:50.450> fo<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
same with triple letter score fo the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
same with triple letter score fo the
letter<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> 2<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> G<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.210> 2<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
letter was a 2 like a G it was at 2 it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.149 
letter was a 2 like a G it was at 2 it
would<00:01:55.380> become<00:01:55.920> 6<00:01:56.729> points<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
would become 6 points and this is a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.440 
would become 6 points and this is a
really<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> double<00:02:00.180> word

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
really good one with the double word

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.580 
really good one with the double word
score

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
score
and<00:02:01.950> again<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and again just with just what it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.770 
and again just with just what it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
indicates the total score is doubled
