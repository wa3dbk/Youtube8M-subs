00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 in this day we are in a new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.340
 emission crafts and day 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.429
 today I'm partying and guess what this 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 this is with a nice truncheon for 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.289
 celebrate the great golden action of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.380
 our dear Felix Sanchez here in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 dominica replenishes then here I have the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 roles in this case the time the tricolor 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.100
 these are formed but I'm going to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.650
 teach in this case how you should do it 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.560
 we take a whole bar of black paper 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.200
 let's do black because there are several 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.200
 colors and we fold 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 in the camera but we doubled 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 you do not understand 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.190
 and then we doubled here 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.329
 we make 3 doubles 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.329
 and we double here 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 before doubling this 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 to close this double 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.860
 let's add these that are already 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.860
 bent 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.860
 let's add these that are already 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.860
 bent 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.790
 and let's put it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.620
 thus 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.190
 let's move on 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.190
 here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 and what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.020
 trim 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.189
 piece of paper and as well as 2 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 tricolor 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.060
 remember that our pages in 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.060
 Facebook 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.070
 you get dotcom crafts here 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.460
 You can find all kinds of videos 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.270
 for the necessary priorities for your 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.539
 important birthday party 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.539
 you know, go ahead and find the jokes 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.859
 how did he keep telling you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.680
 this has to cut it into pieces 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:19.139
 small but in this case since 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 we are in a live broadcast and them 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:26.260
 I'll remember a little bigger 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.360
 and then he will teach you a way of how 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.370
 they can do it 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.959
 without losing a lot of time 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.959
 we keep cutting 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.670
 good that we are doing 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.670
 and our last cut 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.880
 I did not mention materials in this case anymore 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.350
 what are we going to use as he says 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.350
 only materials will be 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.170
 then we align our paper well 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 what we are going to do 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.430
 pink remove the leftovers 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.519
 so that the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.530
 then in the bottom part we're going to do 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.770
 a fold 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.660
 stretch this perspective 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.290
 and let's make another doubles 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.519
 with the help of our tape 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.519
 I do not know how to look for open 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.910
 remember to shake well so that they come out 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.740
 all 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.700
 edges that are hidden 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.980
 of our from our crepe paper what 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.000
 they can do 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.190
 with chinese paper 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.690
 let's put a little 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.850
 but when we see that this one is going 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.970
 achieve so what we're going to do is 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.510
 that for faster 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.510
 to put up 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.120
 ah 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.439
 I make it clear again 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.229
 this requires many double as 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:31.830
 for when they are going to stretch have 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.830
 a facility 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.830
 total 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.990
 and how do you see here 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.990
 we cut out these corners 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.550
 then we cut 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.710
 we treat all the sticky ones 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.300
 we go 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.110
 we will have 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.460
 our portal so remember that for 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.639
 this is needed 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.610
 whole crepe paper so they can 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.990
 stay with a lot of spin and a lot of volume 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.039
 and this was another craft mission 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.770
 I teach my creations and money I will upload 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.659
 for youtube so you can see us 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.210
 we see in another achievement mission modality 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.159
 until next week bye bye and 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.199
 remember to see the channel of the aunt light and 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:40.539
 that I will have an emission of all my 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.539
 tonalities until next week we
