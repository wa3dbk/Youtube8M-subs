00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.870 
simple and go with it's got more rhythm
and<00:02:18.650> that's<00:02:18.860> kind<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.340> way<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.670> base

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and that's kind of the way the base

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.530 
and that's kind of the way the base
drives<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.870> song<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.260> well<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:23.120> get

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
drives the song as well and then you get

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.270 
drives the song as well and then you get
to<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> chorus<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.290> chorus<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.800> nice<00:02:25.100> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.220 

just<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:46.090> else<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.660> think<00:02:46.960> oh
