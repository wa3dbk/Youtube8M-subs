dealing with it now I mean he was in a
kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> fairly<00:01:32.479> intense<00:01:33.920> program<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
kind of fairly intense program to be

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240

ready<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> tour<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.380> something<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ready for the tour so something in the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
ready for the tour so something in the
in<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> preparation<00:01:39.409> maybe<00:01:40.409> he<00:01:40.619> just

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
in that preparation maybe he just

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.270 
in that preparation maybe he just
overdid<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.380> hurt<00:01:43.380> himself<00:01:43.530> maybe

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
overdid it and hurt himself maybe

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
overdid it and hurt himself maybe
without<00:01:45.210> realizing<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> could<00:01:46.680> have

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
without realizing it and it could have

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.130 
without realizing it and it could have
got<00:01:46.920> worse<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:48.149> luckily<00:01:48.420> enough<00:01:48.659> he<00:01:48.990> did

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
got worse but luckily enough he did

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.130 
got worse but luckily enough he did
realize<00:01:49.579> at<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> certain<00:01:50.970> point<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.990> when

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
realize at a certain point I think when

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160 
realize at a certain point I think when
he<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.439> no<00:01:52.590> longer<00:01:52.619> walk<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.960> he

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
he could no longer walk that actually he

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.100 
he could no longer walk that actually he
needed<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> go<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> doctor<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.840> thank<00:01:57.840> God

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
needed to go to the doctor and thank God

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.100 
needed to go to the doctor and thank God
he<00:01:58.259> did<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.600> got<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
he did because by the time they got to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
he did because by the time they got to
see<00:02:01.560> him<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> did<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> scans<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.939> realized

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
see him and did the scans they realized

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.859 
see him and did the scans they realized
that<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.979> fairly<00:02:05.340> major

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
that he actually got some fairly major

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
that he actually got some fairly major
damage<00:02:06.869> and

damage and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
had he not done anything about it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.230 
had he not done anything about it
it<00:02:11.200> could<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.590> actually<00:02:11.890> been<00:02:12.520> very<00:02:12.640> serious

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
it could have actually been very serious

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.770 
it could have actually been very serious
and<00:02:13.450> possibly<00:02:13.990> permanent<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.670> was<00:02:15.880> well

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and possibly permanent so it was well

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.250 
and possibly permanent so it was well
kind<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.350> caught<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.610> think<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.900> were<00:02:19.990> very

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
kind of caught I think we were very

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.580 
kind of caught I think we were very
relieved<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.980> hear<00:02:21.750> when<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:22.780> finally<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
relieved to hear when we finally got the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.860 
relieved to hear when we finally got the
medical<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.489> know<00:02:24.550> information<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.239> he<00:02:25.690> had

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
really so in the moment he was so

somebody who ever really takes a look

you<00:02:40.900> know<00:02:40.980> limitations<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.100> those<00:02:42.550> are

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you know limitations that those are

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.070 
you know limitations that those are
those<00:02:45.340> are<00:02:45.400> very<00:02:46.180> much<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.600> secondary

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
those are very much of secondary

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.140 
those are very much of secondary
importance<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.650> him<00:02:47.800> he's<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.610> moving

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
importance to him he's just about moving

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.750 
importance to him he's just about moving
forward<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:51.040> speed

forward at speed
I<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:52.660> joking<00:02:52.870> earlier<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.650> is

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
I was joking earlier on that this is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500 
I was joking earlier on that this is
probably<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> most<00:02:54.400> rest<00:02:54.790> he'll<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.180> had<00:02:55.360> in

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
probably the most rest he'll have had in

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.780 
probably the most rest he'll have had in
decades<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:57.160> know<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.400> few<00:02:57.610> weeks

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
decades is the you know the few weeks

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.270 
decades is the you know the few weeks
after<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> operation<00:02:58.739> but<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.920> other<00:03:00.040> thing

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
after the operation but the other thing

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.040 
after the operation but the other thing
we<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:00.940> sure<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.420> he<00:03:01.750> does

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
we have to make sure is that he does

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.900 
we have to make sure is that he does
follow<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.769> doctor's<00:03:03.100> orders<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.489> terms<00:03:03.760> of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
follow the doctor's orders in terms of

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.960 
follow the doctor's orders in terms of
the<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.900> program<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.680> rehabilitation

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the the program of rehabilitation

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.580 
the the program of rehabilitation
because<00:03:06.970> knowing<00:03:07.540> him<00:03:07.750> again<00:03:08.050> he'll<00:03:08.380> probably

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
because knowing him again he'll probably

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.130 
because knowing him again he'll probably
wanna<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.730> know<00:03:09.790> take<00:03:09.880> some<00:03:10.330> shortcuts<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
wanna you know take some shortcuts and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.090 
wanna you know take some shortcuts and
and<00:03:11.980> sort<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:13.810> ahead<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.049> himself<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.799> but

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
and sort of get ahead of himself but but

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.620 
and sort of get ahead of himself but but
really<00:03:15.459> from<00:03:15.610> what<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.820> understand<00:03:16.360> it's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
really from what I understand it's

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.330 
really from what I understand it's
important<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.049> he<00:03:17.200> really<00:03:17.500> does<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.280> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
important that he really does this in a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.600 
important that he really does this in a
very<00:03:18.370> methodical<00:03:18.670> way<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.829> so<00:03:20.829> we'll<00:03:21.489> be

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
very methodical way and so we'll be

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.319 
very methodical way and so we'll be
there<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.090> chain<00:03:22.360> him<00:03:22.480> down<00:03:22.750> if<00:03:23.019> if<00:03:23.739> need<00:03:24.040> be

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
there to chain him down if if need be

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.430 
there to chain him down if if need be
though<00:03:25.329> we<00:03:25.450> want<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.720> stress<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.350> this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
though we want to stress that that this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.470 
though we want to stress that that this
is<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> lot<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.980> cancellation<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:28.150> towards

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
is a lot of cancellation of this towards

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.900 
is a lot of cancellation of this towards
postponement<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.860> we'll<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.160> back<00:03:30.340> as<00:03:30.549> soon

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
postponement and we'll be back as soon

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.750 
postponement and we'll be back as soon
as<00:03:31.030> we<00:03:31.180> possibly<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:31.930> we<00:03:32.620> will<00:03:32.860> be<00:03:33.100> back<00:03:33.370> and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
as we possibly can we will be back and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.130 
as we possibly can we will be back and
it'll<00:03:34.570> be<00:03:35.110> bigger<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.680> better<00:03:35.829> than<00:03:36.070> ever<00:03:36.370> and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
it'll be bigger and better than ever and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.650 
it'll be bigger and better than ever and
you<00:03:38.140> know<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.709> weird<00:03:38.920> way<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:40.209> probably

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
you know in a weird way it's probably

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.039 
you know in a weird way it's probably
good<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.910> became<00:03:42.910> evident<00:03:43.390> before<00:03:43.720> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
good that this became evident before the

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.690 
good that this became evident before the
tour<00:03:44.230> started<00:03:44.650> rather<00:03:44.859> than<00:03:45.040> halfway<00:03:45.430> through

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
tour started rather than halfway through

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.509 
tour started rather than halfway through
the<00:03:45.820> tour<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.739> know<00:03:47.890> being<00:03:48.250> philosophical

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
the tour so you know being philosophical

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.330 
the tour so you know being philosophical
about<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.630> kind<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.049> some<00:03:50.340> some

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
about it this this kind of some some

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.640 
about it this this kind of some some
positives<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> way<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.019> thing<00:03:53.260> happened

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
positives to the way this thing happened

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.800 
positives to the way this thing happened
I<00:03:53.829> guess<00:03:54.640> sometime<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.269> August<00:03:55.359> we'll<00:03:55.690> be

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
I guess sometime in August we'll be

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.650

which<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.560> something<00:04:16.739> we've<00:04:16.920> always<00:04:17.160> planned

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
which is something we've always planned

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.210 
which is something we've always planned
to<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.540> never<00:04:18.660> got<00:04:18.900> round<00:04:19.110> to<00:04:19.200> doing<00:04:19.440> for

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
to do and never got round to doing for

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.580 
to do and never got round to doing for
various<00:04:20.549> reasons<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:22.140> we're<00:04:22.290> really<00:04:22.470> excited

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
various reasons so we're really excited

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.950 
various reasons so we're really excited
about<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.310> idea<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.730> playing<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.600> couple<00:04:24.810> of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
about the idea of playing a couple of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.470 
about the idea of playing a couple of
these<00:04:25.080> new<00:04:25.410> tunes<00:04:25.740> from<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> YouTube<00:04:27.240> crowd

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
these new tunes from the YouTube crowd

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.720 
these new tunes from the YouTube crowd
and<00:04:27.780> that'll<00:04:28.740> give<00:04:28.890> us<00:04:28.920> a<00:04:29.100> huge<00:04:29.310> kind<00:04:29.670> of

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
and that'll give us a huge kind of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.410 
and that'll give us a huge kind of
insight<00:04:30.210> into<00:04:30.800> how<00:04:31.800> they're<00:04:32.010> working<00:04:32.420> any

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
insight into how they're working any

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.510 
insight into how they're working any
changes<00:04:33.870> need<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.080> be<00:04:34.170> made<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.950> arrangements

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
changes need to be made the arrangements

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.020 
changes need to be made the arrangements
the<00:04:35.550> tempos<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.360> whatever<00:04:36.630> so<00:04:37.730> it's<00:04:38.730> it's

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the tempos that whatever so it's it's

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.610 
the tempos that whatever so it's it's
the<00:04:39.150> ultimate<00:04:39.270> proving<00:04:39.750> ground<00:04:39.930> for<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.380> tune

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
the ultimate proving ground for a tune

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.490 
the ultimate proving ground for a tune
is<00:04:40.890> playing<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.940> live<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:43.140> we'll<00:04:43.260> have<00:04:43.350> the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
is playing it live and so we'll have the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.050 
is playing it live and so we'll have the
benefit<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:43.980> being<00:04:44.220> able<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.400> play<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> few<00:04:44.910> of

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
benefit of being able to play a few of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.030 
benefit of being able to play a few of
them<00:04:45.180> ahead<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:46.050> recording<00:04:46.680> them<00:04:46.770> which<00:04:46.890> is

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
them ahead of recording them which is

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.520 
them ahead of recording them which is
which<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.520> going<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.670> be<00:04:47.790> great<00:04:48.140> when<00:04:49.140> we<00:04:49.260> do

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
which is going to be great when we do

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.320 
which is going to be great when we do
get<00:04:49.770> back<00:04:50.010> out<00:04:50.220> there<00:04:50.250> we'll<00:04:50.880> be<00:04:50.910> absolutely

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
get back out there we'll be absolutely

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.670 
get back out there we'll be absolutely
in<00:04:51.990> top<00:04:52.890> condition<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:55.050> raring<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.410> go

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
in top condition and just raring to go

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.020 
in top condition and just raring to go
so<00:04:56.100> that's<00:04:56.910> that's<00:04:57.300> our<00:04:57.480> focus<00:04:57.690> now
