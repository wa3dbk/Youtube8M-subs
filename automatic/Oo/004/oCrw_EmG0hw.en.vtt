 with that the coach already who and today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.940
 I'll answer the reader's question. 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.130
 Camila sent you and emailed a question 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.560
 super interesting because she won 20 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 during pregnancy has already achieved 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 lose 12 training and now the last 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 eight seem impossible is making 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 all in the gym doing all the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.260
 gym classes 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.470
 p is on 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 For what it is, and you can not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 lose more weight even though she's doing 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.829
 a lot of exercises in the gym what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 is happening 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 camelot first thing that does not have as 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 Do you think about losing weight? 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.379
 if you do not think about organizing your 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 diet then the first thing you 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.820
 have to do is organize your diet 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.379
 search for the protectionist or 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 there are several books on 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.809
 subject that you can read incorporating 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.270
 concepts in your diet goes super worth 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.170
 my tip is to seek the diet 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.200
 Paleolithic is the low concept and you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 remit the diet of our ancestors 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.290
 before there is agriculture 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.369
 before there is a lot of 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.009
 antinutrients that is how they talk 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.369
 such as the gluten that the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.860
 our normal diet and we already have several 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 studies saying that this type of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 nutrient is harmful to our 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.280
 body and makes us 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 accumulating fat from my diet tip is 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 Paleolithic by looking for any 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.079
 a lawyer who will help you organize 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 Your Diet For You Pts 8 Pounds Finish 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.310
 The second thing about training 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 It's a good idea you go to gym try 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 do everything and think that by doing everything 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.799
 You will spend more calories and so 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.659
 will lose more weight 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.310
 You need to organize your workout. 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 organize what you are doing 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.640
 gym so you get the most 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.500
 I've put the site one of the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 last points that what's there me 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 put the link down here is about the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.509
 Six-week training an organization 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 of 36 weeks for you to lose weight 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.520
 okay this kind of thing works you 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 organize and follow the planning 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.110
 it's not getting to the booth talking and doing 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 when doing something else when doing something you 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.150
 doing so you will get results from the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.580
 The bus can not tell what the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.420
 result you will then have if you 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.500
 organize and epa and behind your your 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 goal with a scheduled training with the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 set time for you to do 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.730
 week 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.390
