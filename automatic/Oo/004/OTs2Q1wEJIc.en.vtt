receiving I've received it a couple of
times<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.910> question<00:00:12.420> regarding<00:00:12.990> why<00:00:13.259> am<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> so

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.010 
times a question regarding why am I so
weak<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.610> people<00:00:14.969> word<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.509> differently

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
weak you know people word it differently

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.680 
weak you know people word it differently
but<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> implication<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.699> why<00:00:18.029> am<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.510> weak

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
but the implication is why am I so weak

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.620 
but the implication is why am I so weak
how<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.439> stronger<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.630> basically

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
how do I get stronger and basically

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540 
how do I get stronger and basically
people<00:00:22.020> feel<00:00:22.439> bad<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:22.980> where<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.519> are

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
people feel bad about where they are

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.630 
people feel bad about where they are
right<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.289> reason<00:00:25.619> why<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> want<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
right now and the reason why I want to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.099 
right now and the reason why I want to
address<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
address this is because I think that

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.160 
address this is because I think that
this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> major<00:00:28.920> problem<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.910> terms<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.720> how

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this is a major problem in terms of how

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.799 
this is a major problem in terms of how
you're<00:00:31.529> looking<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> situation<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you're looking at the situation you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
you're looking at the situation you
don't<00:00:34.020> change<00:00:34.469> weakness<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.550> strength

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
don't change weakness into strength

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810 
don't change weakness into strength
you're<00:00:36.750> already<00:00:37.200> strong<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.399> degrees

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you're already strong it's just degrees

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
you're already strong it's just degrees
of<00:00:39.090> strength<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.780> amplify<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of strength you just amplify that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.400 
of strength you just amplify that
strength<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> are

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
strength and if you think that you are

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.970 
strength and if you think that you are
weak<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.340> won't<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> respect<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
weak now you won't have the respect and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
weak now you won't have the respect and
really<00:00:46.980> admiration<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.120> body's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
really admiration for your body's
capabilities<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> respect

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
capabilities because you have to respect

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
capabilities because you have to respect
how<00:00:51.719> amazing<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.500> body<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.219> when

how amazing your body is because when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
how amazing your body is because when
you<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.090> body<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you think about it your body really is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
you think about it your body really is
an<00:00:55.199> amazing<00:00:55.739> machine<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
an amazing machine and if you don't have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
an amazing machine and if you don't have
that<00:00:57.960> outlook<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.710> won't<00:00:58.980> take<00:00:59.250> care<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that outlook you won't take care of it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.520 
that outlook you won't take care of it
properly<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.449> another<00:01:00.899> reason<00:01:01.109> why<00:01:01.379> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
properly and another reason why it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
properly and another reason why it's
stupid<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> consider<00:01:02.460> yourself<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.910> weak

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
stupid to consider yourself to be weak

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
stupid to consider yourself to be weak
is<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.379> doesn't<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.920> sense<00:01:04.979> if

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
is because it just doesn't make sense if

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
is because it just doesn't make sense if
you're<00:01:05.820> defining<00:01:06.210> yourself<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:07.049> comparison

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you're defining yourself in comparison

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
you're defining yourself in comparison
to<00:01:07.860> others<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:09.360> fine<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to others and that's fine for

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.109 
to others and that's fine for
competition<00:01:10.650> sake<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> comes<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
competition sake but when it comes to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.030 
competition sake but when it comes to
how<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> identify<00:01:12.630> yourself<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> really

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
how you identify yourself that really

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.429 
how you identify yourself that really
doesn't<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:14.549> sense<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.990> everyone

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
doesn't make sense because if everyone

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
doesn't make sense because if everyone
else<00:01:16.530> suddenly<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:17.220> stronger<00:01:17.610> does<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
else suddenly got stronger does that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
else suddenly got stronger does that
make<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> weaker<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.140> doesn't<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
make you weaker it doesn't it's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.859 
make you weaker it doesn't it's
irrelevant<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.450> who<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
irrelevant to what you are to who you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
irrelevant to what you are to who you
are<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.290> isn't<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.100> Arnold

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
are it isn't like some Arnold

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
are it isn't like some Arnold
Schwarzenegger<00:01:24.150> guy<00:01:24.450> would<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.869> take<00:01:25.110> your

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
Schwarzenegger guy would just take your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
Schwarzenegger guy would just take your
place<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> didn't<00:01:26.220> exist

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
place if you didn't exist

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
place if you didn't exist
nothing<00:01:27.450> would<00:01:27.659> take<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:27.990> place<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.500> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
nothing would take your place so it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
nothing would take your place so it's
you<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.130> nothing<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:29.759> why<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.360> strong

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you or nothing that's why you are strong

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.830 
you or nothing that's why you are strong
you<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.310> positive<00:01:32.310> characteristics<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you have positive characteristics and it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
you have positive characteristics and it
just<00:01:34.020> makes<00:01:34.290> no<00:01:34.409> sense<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.340> define<00:01:35.729> yourself

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
just makes no sense to define yourself

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.960 
just makes no sense to define yourself
by<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> lack<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.770> comparison<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> others

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
by what you lack in comparison to others

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
by what you lack in comparison to others
so<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> issue<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.409> be

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so that's really the issue you can be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.679 
so that's really the issue you can be
dissatisfied<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.479> terms

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
dissatisfied with where you are in terms

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
dissatisfied with where you are in terms
of<00:01:42.840> performance<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.649> keep<00:01:43.890> trying<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of performance and keep trying to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.359 
of performance and keep trying to
improve<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> can't<00:01:46.049> identify

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369

improve that but you can't identify
yourself<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> being<00:01:48.030> weak<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.170> becomes

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
yourself as being weak that just becomes

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
yourself as being weak that just becomes
way<00:01:49.710> too<00:01:49.740> problematic<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.210> to

way too problematic and it's going to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
way too problematic and it's going to
hurt<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> long<00:01:52.439> run<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.009> then

hurt you in the long run because then

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.490 
hurt you in the long run because then
you're<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> patient<00:01:54.540> enough<00:01:54.810> to
