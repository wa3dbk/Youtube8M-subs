00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.049
 the meeting now lives conditions 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 cyclonic for almost two hours 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.349
 and the hardest is before us I 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.109
 deplores it is a serious wounded 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 seven wounded light almost all in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.539
 circumstances that did not happen 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270
 to be 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 outside of people who are not 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.859
 not confined to their homes 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
 with shutters and closed doors so my 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.279
 first message is to recall that in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.399
 red vigilance 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 you have to take cover the time of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 the repair 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.550
 the time of the refurbishment will come 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 I hope he will come fast but he 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 is not there yet and again 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 the hardest is before us since the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.239
 cyclone continues to get closer to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.129
 lille 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.640
 he is now less than a hundred 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.100
 of km it will be as close as it will be 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.590
 maybe on the island by the end of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
 the afternoon so the instructions of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.600
 vigilance caution for oneself for 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.930
 the others always matter second 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 message 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.570
 the cyclone will pass near or on the coast 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 west with a strong swell so on these 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.869
 shores 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 on these communes of saint paul de saint 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.799
 salt pond in liaison with the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.750
 mayors of course the precautions 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.479
 local that could be taken 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 have to be in due time I have a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 look very particular therefore on these 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.240
 sectors 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 that does not exonerate the rest of the island where 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.290
 the winds will continue to be strong and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.000
 cyclonic levels in the hours to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.369
 to come that does not exonerate the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.869
 waters or extremely rainfall 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.970
 important continue to be 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.220
 recorded on the west coast 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 all services to vigilance 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.820
 particular on the sector of 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.860
 the pond in saint paul where there is a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 rating of water heights that is 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.060
 closely followed so that we can 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.850
 consultation with the Mayor of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.950
 Saint Paul intervene if necessary 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 more generally and I quoted the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.939
 three municipalities just now on purpose 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.280
 if some of the most 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.649
 concerned who are set back from the shore 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 set back from the coastline does not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.740
 do not feel safe of course 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.580
 the hosting center of the hour 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.830
 we are within reach and if he wishes 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.360
 state their fears or ask 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.830
 a question 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.989
 the city hall the services of the state 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 gendarmerie firefighters are 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.050
 obviously to listen to everyone 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 I also recall that the prefecture 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.190
 has set up a toll free number 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.440
 continue to function during the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.420
 red period and that makes sure that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.640
 we can I think in any case answer 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.110
 to all kinds of concern it's 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.269
 hard to do by the time it is 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.950
 an inventory of damage damage there is 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.090
 already I started earlier by 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.280
 human damage because obviously 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.660
 my first goal is to protect 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.760
 people with all the services that 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 work with me material damage 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 cost the coastal road the road to 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.540
 cilaos the mountain road are 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.830
 closed are impractical because 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.049
 that there were tree falls because 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.880
 that there were landslides so the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.799
 moment of the inventory will come what 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.750
 is certain that already this 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.290
 cyclone will leave behind damage 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.580
 materials 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.580
 surely significant
