stupidity does not refer to online

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210 
stupidity does not refer to online
woodworkers<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.860> something<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
woodworkers that that was something that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.750 
woodworkers that that was something that
they<00:02:08.459> said<00:02:08.789> later<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> video<00:02:10.489> which<00:02:11.489> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
they said later on in the video which I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
they said later on in the video which I
guess<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.629> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
guess for you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
guess for you
people<00:02:13.710> who<00:02:13.860> SAT<00:02:14.130> through<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.550> entire<00:02:14.910> video

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
people who SAT through the entire video

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.180 
people who SAT through the entire video
and<00:02:15.750> well<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> guess<00:02:16.320> maybe<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.680> four<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and well I guess maybe the four of you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
and well I guess maybe the four of you
who<00:02:17.370> stayed<00:02:17.820> awake<00:02:18.120> during<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.630> video<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
who stayed awake during that video you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.600 
who stayed awake during that video you
would<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.680> known<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.220> were<00:02:20.250> talking

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
would have known that they were talking

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.640 
would have known that they were talking
they<00:02:21.270> were<00:02:21.840> talking<00:02:21.960> about<00:02:22.260> themselves<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.820> I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
they were talking about themselves so I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.360 
they were talking about themselves so I
guess<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.920> still<00:02:26.130> sort<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.820> fits<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:29.040> anyways

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
guess it still sort of fits but anyways

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.090 
guess it still sort of fits but anyways
the<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:30.000> guy<00:02:30.120> sent<00:02:30.480> me<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.630> transcript<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> what

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the one guy sent me a transcript of what

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.760 
the one guy sent me a transcript of what
they<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:32.760> said<00:02:33.300> which<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.050> suppose<00:02:34.080> he

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
they actually said which I suppose he

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.380 
they actually said which I suppose he
wants<00:02:35.010> me<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.130> read<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
wants me to read this to you so I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.720 
wants me to read this to you so I
thought<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.780> would<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:38.070> would<00:02:38.250> set<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.550> all

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
thought this would this would set it all

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.570 
thought this would this would set it all
straight<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.330> cleared<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.340> you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
straight and cleared up and so that you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.760 
straight and cleared up and so that you
understand<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.870> they<00:02:43.050> were<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.380> talking

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
understand that they were not talking

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.430 
understand that they were not talking
about<00:02:44.190> online<00:02:44.480> woodworkers<00:02:45.480> being<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.110> perfect

like my favorite kind of error which is
one<00:03:38.340> which<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.300> where<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:39.989> bit<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.350> stupidity

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
one which is where one bit of stupidity

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.699 
one which is where one bit of stupidity
gets<00:03:41.190> compounded<00:03:41.850> by<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> second<00:03:43.320> bit<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
gets compounded by a second bit of

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.270 
gets compounded by a second bit of
stupidity<00:03:44.100> into<00:03:44.810> crossing<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.320> streams<00:03:46.830> into

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
stupidity into crossing the streams into

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.830 
stupidity into crossing the streams into
a<00:03:48.049> perfect<00:03:49.049> storm<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:50.220> stupidity<00:03:53.750> there<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840
