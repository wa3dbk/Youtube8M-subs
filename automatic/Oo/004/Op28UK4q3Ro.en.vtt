00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
these brilliantly colored chickens they

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.580 
these brilliantly colored chickens they
were<00:00:24.279> so<00:00:24.670> pretty<00:00:25.000> we<00:00:25.660> took<00:00:25.810> lots<00:00:26.109> and<00:00:26.320> lots<00:00:26.470> of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
were so pretty we took lots and lots of

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.230 
were so pretty we took lots and lots of
pictures<00:00:26.800> but<00:00:27.310> they<00:00:27.760> start<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.119> look

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
pictures but they start to look

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.939 
pictures but they start to look
repetitive<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:28.929> we<00:00:29.080> were<00:00:29.260> looking<00:00:29.410> for<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.769> way

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
repetitive so we were looking for a way

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.070 
repetitive so we were looking for a way
to<00:00:29.980> add<00:00:30.279> some<00:00:30.550> dimension<00:00:30.730> if<00:00:31.599> you<00:00:31.689> take<00:00:31.929> a<00:00:31.960> look

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
to add some dimension if you take a look

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.110 
to add some dimension if you take a look
at<00:00:32.290> this<00:00:32.439> picture<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.980> particular<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:34.090> can

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
at this picture in particular you can

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.270 
at this picture in particular you can
see<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.780> we've<00:00:34.900> got<00:00:35.140> some<00:00:35.440> highlights<00:00:35.980> here

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
see that we've got some highlights here

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.400 
see that we've got some highlights here
in<00:00:36.489> our<00:00:36.610> grass<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.360> in<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.019> chickens

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
in our grass and in the chickens

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.920 
in our grass and in the chickens
feathers<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.070> also<00:00:39.790> in<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.059> white<00:00:40.270> flowers

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
feathers and also in the white flowers

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.799 
feathers and also in the white flowers
now<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:42.100> just<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.610> tiny<00:00:42.850> bit<00:00:43.059> but<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.629> adds

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
now it's just a tiny bit but it adds

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.479 
now it's just a tiny bit but it adds
definitely<00:00:44.410> some<00:00:44.620> accent<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.219> it<00:00:45.309> if<00:00:45.370> you

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
definitely some accent to it if you

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.479 
definitely some accent to it if you
compare<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.379> photo<00:00:47.379> side<00:00:47.680> by<00:00:47.890> side<00:00:48.160> where<00:00:48.399> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
compare a photo side by side where the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.310 
compare a photo side by side where the
grass<00:00:48.700> hasn't<00:00:49.030> been<00:00:49.329> done<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.750> can<00:00:49.780> see<00:00:50.140> the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
grass hasn't been done you can see the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.500 
grass hasn't been done you can see the
difference<00:00:50.649> between<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.190> two<00:00:51.370> now<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.300> way

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
difference between the two now the way

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.910 
difference between the two now the way
that<00:00:52.539> we're<00:00:52.840> going<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.050> achieve<00:00:53.199> this<00:00:53.710> is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
that we're going to achieve this is

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.400 
that we're going to achieve this is

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.419 
of lines now when you start to draw with
the<00:01:25.509> pen<00:01:25.750> you'll<00:01:26.080> see<00:01:26.349> that<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.679> has<00:01:26.770> an<00:01:27.099> opaque

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.029 
the pen you'll see that it has an opaque
finish<00:01:27.819> to<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.810> pens<00:01:29.020> really<00:01:29.500> do<00:01:29.709> dry

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
finish to it and the pens really do dry

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.449 
finish to it and the pens really do dry
opaque<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.470> it's<00:01:32.649> really<00:01:33.009> neat<00:01:33.429> because

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
opaque in and it's really neat because

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.699 
opaque in and it's really neat because
they<00:01:33.849> dry<00:01:34.360> with<00:01:34.599> like<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> souffle<00:01:35.289> effect

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
they dry with like a souffle effect

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.219 
they dry with like a souffle effect
where<00:01:36.399> they<00:01:36.580> rise<00:01:36.970> right<00:01:37.539> off<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.020> page

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
where they rise right off of the page

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.779 
where they rise right off of the page
and<00:01:38.410> that's<00:01:38.619> what<00:01:38.860> allows<00:01:39.190> us<00:01:39.429> to<00:01:39.580> have<00:01:39.759> this

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
and that's what allows us to have this

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.139 
and that's what allows us to have this
added<00:01:40.239> dimension<00:01:40.959> and<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:42.429> just<00:01:42.580> continue<00:01:42.789> to

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
added dimension and you just continue to

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.880 
added dimension and you just continue to
