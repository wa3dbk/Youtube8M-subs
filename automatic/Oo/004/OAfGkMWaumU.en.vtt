well<00:00:28.050> obviously<00:00:28.380> we're<00:00:28.619> gonna<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> lot<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
well obviously we're gonna see a lot of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640 
well obviously we're gonna see a lot of
cheap<00:00:29.460> crap<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> by<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.439> we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
cheap crap you know and by the way we

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
cheap crap you know and by the way we
are<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> mean<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.219> gonna<00:00:32.430> happen<00:00:32.780> but<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
are I mean that's gonna happen but I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.040 
are I mean that's gonna happen but I
think<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> thing<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.530> didn't<00:00:34.950> anticipate<00:00:35.309> was

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
think the thing we didn't anticipate was

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
think the thing we didn't anticipate was
what<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.620> company<00:00:38.100> decides<00:00:38.460> they're

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
what if some company decides they're

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
what if some company decides they're
gonna<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:38.969> something<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> isn't<00:00:39.780> crap<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
gonna make something that isn't crap you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.910 
gonna make something that isn't crap you
know<00:00:40.610> what<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:42.140> we<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.770> look

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the 11 and 13 share the same design

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
the 11 and 13 share the same design
language<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> similar

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
got a second one with my wife's using

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
got a second one with my wife's using
one<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> two<00:01:12.479> HP<00:01:12.659> stream<00:01:12.990> 11<00:01:13.439> s

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
one as well we have two HP stream 11 s

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.219 
one as well we have two HP stream 11 s
and<00:01:13.619> I've<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> 13<00:01:14.250> coming<00:01:14.869> there<00:01:15.869> low-end

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and I've got a 13 coming there low-end

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.510 
and I've got a 13 coming there low-end
machines<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.710> their<00:01:16.920> atoms<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.400> have

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
machines you know their atoms they have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.070 
machines you know their atoms they have
2<00:01:17.670> gigs<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> storage<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.600> probably<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.990> think

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
2 gigs of storage is probably I think

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.190 
2 gigs of storage is probably I think
it's<00:01:19.229> 32<00:01:19.619> gigs<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.070> emmc<00:01:20.610> storage<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's 32 gigs of emmc storage on the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's 32 gigs of emmc storage on the
device<00:01:22.470> universal<00:01:22.680> fraction<00:01:23.340> storage<00:01:23.610> but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
device universal fraction storage but

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
device universal fraction storage but
they're<00:01:24.659> beautiful<00:01:25.049> looking<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:26.430> work

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
they're beautiful looking they work

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
they're beautiful looking they work
great<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.320> they're

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
great for what they are you know they're

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that and the HP you know the stream 11

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.910 
that and the HP you know the stream 11
is<00:01:37.049> particularly<00:01:37.409> interesting<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.799> me

amount of one drive storage right so you

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.750 
amount of one drive storage right so you
would<00:03:37.889> guess<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.099> because<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.579> got<00:03:38.730> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
would guess that because you got the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.990 
would guess that because you got the
office<00:03:39.180> personal<00:03:40.139> yeah<00:03:40.440> 362<00:03:41.069> so<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.459> get<00:03:41.700> so

it's<00:03:45.510> that's<00:03:46.169> fascinating<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.790> know

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
it's that's fascinating and it you know

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.839 
it's that's fascinating and it you know
I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:49.650> part<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> value<00:03:50.669> proposition

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
I think part of the value proposition

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.039 
I think part of the value proposition
here<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:53.060> from<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> Productivity<00:03:54.389> standpoint

as we speak but right now is available

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.800 
as we speak but right now is available
for<00:05:06.870> sixty<00:05:07.260> dollars<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.910> don't<00:05:09.240> have<00:05:09.450> one<00:05:09.660> I've

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
for sixty dollars I don't have one I've

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.850 
for sixty dollars I don't have one I've
not<00:05:09.960> seen<00:05:10.140> one<00:05:10.290> but<00:05:10.470> I've<00:05:10.560> heard<00:05:10.680> from

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
not seen one but I've heard from

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.110 
not seen one but I've heard from
multiple<00:05:11.280> people<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.820> wind<00:05:11.970> book

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
multiple people that the wind book

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.240 
multiple people that the wind book
tablets<00:05:12.540> are<00:05:12.660> very<00:05:12.840> high<00:05:12.960> quality<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.650> they

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
tablets are very high quality and they

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.950 
tablets are very high quality and they
also<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.670> a<00:05:14.700> couple<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.120> higher-end<00:05:15.360> version

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
also have a couple of higher-end version

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.990 
also have a couple of higher-end version
so<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.140> can<00:05:16.290> go<00:05:16.380> from<00:05:16.700> seven<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.850> eight<00:05:17.970> inches

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
so you can go from seven to eight inches

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.520 
so you can go from seven to eight inches
and<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.630> think<00:05:18.810> they<00:05:18.870> have<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:19.020> 10<00:05:19.170> inch<00:05:19.320> version

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
and I think they have a 10 inch version

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.830 
and I think they have a 10 inch version
as<00:05:19.800> well
