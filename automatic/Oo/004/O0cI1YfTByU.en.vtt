then i put a little bit more on top of
the<00:03:12.560> foundation<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.640> does<00:03:13.910> blend

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the foundation and it really does blend

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.979 
the foundation and it really does blend
in<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.850> like<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.880> dream<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.570> that's<00:03:17.810> in

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
in and like a dream the one that's in

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.490 
in and like a dream the one that's in
the<00:03:18.430> trio<00:03:19.430> i<00:03:19.790> find<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.840> one<00:03:21.079> that's<00:03:21.320> in

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
the trio i find that the one that's in

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.140 
the trio i find that the one that's in
the<00:03:21.709> single<00:03:22.070> part<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.370> much<00:03:22.579> more<00:03:22.820> thicker

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
the single part is much more thicker

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.759 
the single part is much more thicker
creamier<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.750> hard<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.140> blend<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.500> which<00:03:24.680> is

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
creamier and hard to blend in which is

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.720 
creamier and hard to blend in which is
where<00:03:24.950> i<00:03:24.980> try<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.280> use<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> fluffier<00:03:26.030> brush<00:03:26.320> and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
where i try to use a fluffier brush and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.970 
where i try to use a fluffier brush and
but<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> trio<00:03:29.959> while<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.440> diffuse<00:03:30.829> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
but for the trio while of diffuse this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.759 
but for the trio while of diffuse this
Sigma<00:03:31.489> assess<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:32.480> line<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.930> think<00:03:33.500> as<00:03:33.650> I

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
Sigma assess one line to think as I

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.690 
Sigma assess one line to think as I
concealer<00:03:34.220> brush<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.560> really<00:03:37.250> does

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
concealer brush and and it really does

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.880 
concealer brush and and it really does
really<00:03:37.940> well<00:03:38.120> i<00:03:38.660> think<00:03:39.019> if<00:03:39.320> parted<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.799> a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
really well i think if parted in a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.440 
really well i think if parted in a
recently

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
recently

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.580 
recently
that<00:03:40.660> her<00:03:40.900> all<00:03:41.650> her<00:03:41.800> concealers<00:03:42.340> are<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.610> same

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
that her all her concealers are the same

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.839 
that her all her concealers are the same
texture<00:03:44.590> as<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:47.310> foundations<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.550> I<00:03:48.670> think

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
texture as the foundations but I think

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.460 
texture as the foundations but I think
she<00:03:49.030> meant<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.269> what<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.629> jewel<00:03:49.840> ones<00:03:50.170> or

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
she meant the what the jewel ones or

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.270 
she meant the what the jewel ones or
maybe<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.950> ones<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.489> trio's<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:54.220> I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
maybe the ones and the trio's so that I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.190 
maybe the ones and the trio's so that I
do<00:03:54.489> think<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.150> thicker<00:03:55.569> or<00:03:55.780> maybe<00:03:56.050> that's

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
do think this is thicker or maybe that's

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.930 
do think this is thicker or maybe that's
just<00:03:56.379> my<00:03:56.560> personal<00:03:57.160> experience<00:03:57.610> I've<00:03:57.700> had<00:03:57.730> it

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
just my personal experience I've had it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.550 
just my personal experience I've had it
