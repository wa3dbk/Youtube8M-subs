00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.179
 greece my name is a bun but here before 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.629
 she died to change 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.460
 I decided to keep medal of honor about the first 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.369
 then 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.730
 she is in Kiev 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.669
 some 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.139
 changing the network jogging now i'm not 

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:26.779
 will I play 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.259
 with an adversary and 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.060
 I will not show you at the construction site 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.870
 so simple my first acquaintance pay 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.040
 Attention 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.540
 I have this belt in the corner 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 also come alfi ude she 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.500
 in general, everything is done exactly the same 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.840
 as prices 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.560
 yes he got 5 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.680
 that is, ii and literacy can only 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.110
 prokopiy paul ii banal 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.420
 copy came up then there is nothing 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.660
 Changed the complex fishermen south just 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.200
 moved windows 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.930
 I was in a coma canceled all 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.040
 happened 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.860
 it's nice nice that 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.240
 but they are back again 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.340
 to sources never 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 r there is an interface of my game 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050
 I can not only life sucker servers 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.570
 to choose 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.300
 to the very 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.660
 Inter in the game press 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.880
 but there is a superior mode 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.230
 which is called sector control 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.540
 it is primarily of interest to me 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.520
 mode because m saransk 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.120
 immediately policy but the only server 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.850
 great difficulty which works in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.200
 This mode is more detailed as you can see the player 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.630
 held such 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.060
 patriotic himself fighter alpha 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.130
 unpatriotic for some reason uses 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.510
 German rifle 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.340
 And in my gun yarygin it 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.590
 Russian pistol modern but very 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.530
 similar to the totals at least from them 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.900
 turn out to be completely different 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.080
 gun success 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.860
 without pretending to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.350
 she specialists now you actually 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.550
 could see that i 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.869
 checked as a fighter gets up 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.769
 popularly switching to 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.399
 the gun rises in my dollar something like this 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.929
 same fast as in the lie cabins that is 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.399
 this chip when without swinging 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.259
 sight 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.379
 there is at the moment of switching already 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.279
 there is here you switch the district is lurking 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.989
 showed previous leaders 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.659
 I know that in the document 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.230
 secondarily it is a grab point here 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.109
 pie is soon capture 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.399
 if we talk about flat ogre times 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.029
 undermined produced quickly 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.799
 here u and how can you see that rpc 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.980
 capture not captured even a point is done 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.650
 will raise a fighter 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.540
 long enough that is to react 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.660
 m enemy is easy 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.589
 well, that is, long enough and honestly in 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:00.020
 europe 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.880
 within certain sector boundaries 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.119
 capture 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.299
 he's small enough 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.299
 that is, everything is close 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.979
 Carla xii century 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.760
 which is on 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.629
 capture flag was made in 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.630
 limits there 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.630
 three five meters from the flag itself 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.809
 search by the enemy was not required in contrast 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.879
 from from the same start from divorce paid money 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.249
 she capture points made in 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.540
 wide enough limits and there is much 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.049
 will repeat 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.359
 bright example Konstantinovsky 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.419
 for this medal of honor this is this point 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.279
 entry is made only inside the walls 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.549
 inside the walls 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.089
 in my opinion there was one grenade 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.749
 enough skb bank to knock everyone out 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.199
 exciting this point 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.319
 gia is essentially a one-man hold 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.669
 becomes impossible 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.119
 you specifically in this game unlike ford 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.449
 finally code 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.879
 and not unlike the kind of logic 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.879
 there is it approximates and difficult logic 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.539
 Rosaviation 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.819
 and in my opinion it is still bad because 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.839
 what 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.839
 as if that is what we have achieved 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.059
 start here rst it 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.349
 players desire to grab points there 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.270
 points goes from hand to hand very often 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.960
 but while spending the night like in which 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.060
 several points are required to capture a point 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.199
 fighters 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.770
 and boldly required insurance premiums for 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.319
 dedication 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.409
 when fighters 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.080
 taking risks 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.659
 still grabbing 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.309
 there interleaves often does not 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.029
 have time to do it 10 times for us, that is, and 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:51.849
 lactation 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.779
 such a rather complicated process 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.479
 reach point if its dzo to capture 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.139
 limited to five meters what else is here 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.139
 interesting is the invisible walls 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.089
 what they tried to avoid 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.599
 in the shed he is everywhere done everywhere 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.580
 that is, again this 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.930
 copying 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.930
 features cool money and 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.400
 but it is allowed 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.419
 prp 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.819
 i.e. he is a game close 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.550
 precisely Kolbin 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.909
 the battlefield percentage and here remains m long 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.910
 physics is rather awkward income 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.289
 shackled children 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.319
 ran out of video stream me 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.509
 Well, actually, thank you all for all 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:39.360
 Attention 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.909
 happily
