00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
I think it has some awesome potential

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.810 
I think it has some awesome potential
and<00:05:33.150> I'm<00:05:33.240> also<00:05:33.539> very<00:05:34.200> excited<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.950> see<00:05:35.160> what

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
and I'm also very excited to see what

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.879 
and I'm also very excited to see what
Apple<00:05:36.240> does<00:05:36.389> in<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.870> wearable<00:05:37.320> industry<00:05:37.740> if

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
Apple does in the wearable industry if

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.560 
Apple does in the wearable industry if
they<00:05:38.099> decide<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.400> even<00:05:38.760> enter<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.360> do

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
they decide to even enter it and do

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.270 
they decide to even enter it and do
anything<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.199> first<00:05:40.380> place<00:05:40.620> but<00:05:41.190> of

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
anything in the first place but of

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.350 
anything in the first place but of
course<00:05:41.310> like<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.760> said<00:05:41.910> before<00:05:42.000> I<00:05:42.210> definitely

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
course like I said before I definitely

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.240 
course like I said before I definitely
think<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:42.810> has<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.960> lot<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.260> potential<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.949> it

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
think it has a lot of potential and it

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.920 
think it has a lot of potential and it
almost<00:05:44.400> seems<00:05:44.729> easier<00:05:45.210> just<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.660> check

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
almost seems easier just to check

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.080 
almost seems easier just to check
notifications<00:05:46.199> on<00:05:47.010> your<00:05:47.310> wrist<00:05:47.580> rather<00:05:47.910> than

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
notifications on your wrist rather than

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.790 
notifications on your wrist rather than
having<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.449> pull<00:05:48.720> out<00:05:48.840> your<00:05:49.020> phone<00:05:49.050> every<00:05:49.410> time

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
having to pull out your phone every time

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.350 
having to pull out your phone every time
because<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.490> course<00:05:50.760> isn't<00:05:50.940> sure<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.180> lot<00:05:51.300> of

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
because of course isn't sure a lot of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.969 
because of course isn't sure a lot of
you<00:05:51.479> already<00:05:51.570> know<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:51.990> some<00:05:52.349> notifications

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
you already know this some notifications

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.980 
you already know this some notifications
are<00:05:53.160> more<00:05:53.430> important<00:05:53.910> than<00:05:53.940> others<00:05:54.449> so<00:05:54.930> it

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
are more important than others so it

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.089 
are more important than others so it
definitely<00:05:55.139> helps<00:05:55.530> when<00:05:55.590> you<00:05:55.710> can<00:05:55.860> kind<00:05:56.039> of

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
definitely helps when you can kind of

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.400 
definitely helps when you can kind of
screen<00:05:56.520> them<00:05:56.699> in<00:05:56.910> advance<00:05:57.030> prior<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.960> checking

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
screen them in advance prior to checking
