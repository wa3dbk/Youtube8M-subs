00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.320
 okay i said five principles 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.920
 get successful positive attitude in life after the first run 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.070
 is what I actually already have for the British Empire 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 is that you have to deal differently with the circumstances you have to go differently 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.010
 look at the circumstances in the other interpretation year 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.660
 circumstances 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.490
 for example, if you are in a traffic jam 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.500
 then you can and elections to disappoint 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.490
 of those fell 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.400
 here I have the agreements 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 stand up and you may come and leave and you can sit there groaning in it 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.700
 that car you can there 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.050
 I know a lot about where you are eating at your hotel 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.030
 what it is it doesn't take you a meter further 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.560
 You honestly don't get to your destination quickly 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.410
 so the only thing you are doing is eating up inside yourself 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.210
 and that only makes music and that only makes you irritated and makes it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.920
 you only pessimistic and negative 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 so why would you choose that you have nothing 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.500
 there you can do better what the bible says the bible says 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.750
 this grateful under all circumstances be happy and start thanking you 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 in that vision that sounds stupid but you can't change anything about the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.550
 situation and you know the best moment that your thoughts are going to focus on 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.610
 the things of god 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.149
 the moment you start thinking about the positive things 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.560
 then also staying in that fell at that time being at a given time 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.409
 less to the pleasant 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 at the moment you can still enjoy the people around you look at 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 your neighbors in the car and you look the more you look at the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.219
 at the sky above to the sky 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.229
 and it becomes a very different situation 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.770
 well the circumstances are the same 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.729
 but the point is this you have made a choice 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.350
 to deal with positively 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.560
 so it meant god meant that we would learn to be the every one 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.189
 to be positive 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.360
 I have her story 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.620
 it really happened 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.790
 and the one told someone who was also in a traffic jam and that person is that himself 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.360
 terrible to eat 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930
 what the agreements are important agreements 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.089
 and that all continues to go wrong 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:27.109
 and he he was getting so angry but he believes in god and on one 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.810
 given moment 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.579
 she god against a stone are people inside that she junked 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.379
 by what my word say do what the bible says 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.680
 but what does the bible say both say be happy and grateful in all 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.889
 circumstances 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.819
 and he thought yes then it can do well I am going wrong how can I now happy and 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 be thankful while everything goes wrong the way 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.719
 he decided and there 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.649
 so a very important one he made a decision 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.619
 not to be negative and he recently started that he was in that file and 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.240
 recently their problems were under control 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.070
 the threatened to come that day of mourning I'm just going to thank god 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.939
 and he started to thank well now to make a long story short he is 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.599
 eventually come across his job and let things happen 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.089
 may not have gone quite the way I wanted but he heard later 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.659
 a few 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.659
 miles away there was a very bad accident 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.619
 which even killed people 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.559
 he saw that as he 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.569
 he could have just kept on driving himself in that accident 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.360
 beatty himself sat in the dark but because he came to be in the final 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.700
 it is that guarded 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.379
 the same is true of many things in life 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.189
 and I don't know why certain things sometimes go the way they do 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.459
 And you can only do that you can put a lot of pressure on you can make it difficult for him 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.889
 to do 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.770
 but the atmosphere is now a boat and saved for something 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.810
 maybe it's the right thing to close the door 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.099
 The company you want builds at that time 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.869
 but because he opens the other doors 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.249
 where you have much more 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.079
 achieve more success and happiness and prosperity 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.859
 so this first principle 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.259
 is very clear 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:11.639
 I have to go and learn everything if you want to read it in the Bible 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.040
 maybe i'll say yes but where is that dad ma 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.310
 the point to read longer in a holiday 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.919
 5 verse 20 a party of 20 ponds should be at ease 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.770
 looking in the bible and the state 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.500
 very clear god principles gives how you can be positive to the fear 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.930
 negative circumstances 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.140
 but I have another one 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.360
 Basically another point that I give a picture 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.900
 this is a very important one 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 starts every day with positive influence 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.810
 if you get up in the morning before you start doing things 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.440
 make sure you feel positive that the law filled your mind 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.210
 be with positivity 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.699
 but what should you think about but I would say 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.610
 take the bible because god is positive he is england positivity 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.070
 his word the bible 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.040
 that that it infuses only positivity from that is a source of 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.550
 inspiration I want it myself 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.949
 no matter how i am looking for sometimes i was a rabbit so expensive it took 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.440
 packing the bible and then start reading 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.939
 and maybe that doesn't happen at that time 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.439
 but as time goes on and the morning starts to bite, they start 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.180
 words of goldie suddenly start flowing in my inside and then one comes 

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:23.179
 more positive view of the world I look at things differently 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.729
 so i want to advise you of want to be a positive in life 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.020
 start the day with positive input 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.680
 read the reading and extract from the bible 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.729
 and then you will see 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.700
 just as you meditate there, he will think about it during the day 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.420
 that it is always a tremendous force directed inside 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.490
 and whatever may happen the rest of the day 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.199
 you already have a good start, so to speak 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.610
 we often see commercials saying they sometimes start well there 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.380
 with a good breakfast or something 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.080
 but that's just the outside is that body 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.139
 I would say we go one step further and not just start a good one 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:57.710
 breakfast 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.930
 also start with a good word from god 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.509
 the date city centers 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.479
 your thoughts are filled with the positive things of god 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.069
 you know what the point is god is 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:09.879
 good 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.449
 as a good god, only my thoughts of salvation remain 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.770
 goodness forwards 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.300
 he wants it to go well now that is the intention of god 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.810
 therefore if you god 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.819
 in the first place she will learn to put into your life 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:28.159
 then would see that that goes with all the good work of god 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.470
 can now really make you happy 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.930
 the point is this 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.890
 god don't demand that we put him first he invites you and says 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.260
 of job if you put me first, if you were the first thing you were looking for 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.639
 be it up with your time with me 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.800
 we will see 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.259
 that my lines of energy 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.540
 though a positive power of god applied 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.860
 that he is in your life 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.069
 will start flowing 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.080
 and you look at the world differently 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.440
 They actually become a bit like those Saudi Arabia people when it rains 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.139
 that you are no longer depressed 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.050
 and 19 for nine starts right in jupille and jumps almelo it's raining you 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.470
 After other settings, it gets those circumstances and that it is well understood 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:10.619
 after a third point I want to give it 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.729
 of negative messages 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.740
 make sure you close for negative messages 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.439
 when i watch the television after the news every 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.800
 evening 8 o'clock news 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.819
 I don't know how they make it up but it is almost only negative now 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.250
 of course a lot of junk and misery happens in the world 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.870
 but the rumors but also so many good things in the world and why 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.280
 we don't take the time to broadcast that 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000
 9 we are bombarded with negativity with the with for the with the 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.759
 killings 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.310
 with the theft with 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.110
 orloog and you name it but this is a good thing that takes place there though 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.180
 You almost don't get through the duration of not responding to the news 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.159
 you can let that come over you every day 

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.599
 and by looking at it 

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.020
 but you can also choose more 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.749
 positively influenced 

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:03.259
 that you no longer look everywhere, but that you are sending out the negative message 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:03.769
 the way goes
