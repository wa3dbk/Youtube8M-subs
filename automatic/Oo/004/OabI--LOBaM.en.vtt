 【How to make radish】 STEP1 How to peel Katsura-eel, how to make 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.000
 You can change the language of the subtitles 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Or, please look at the English version 

00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:10.893
 I cut the top and bottom 

00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:13.733
 Cut so that the radish is parallel 

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.133
 Make a beautiful cylinder 

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.653
 Thin blade knife is the easiest in basics 

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:26.453
 Hold the radish with your left hand and turn down the longer diameter radish 

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:29.053
 Radishes and knives are at 90 degrees 

00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:31.793
 The bottom is also 90 degrees 

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:35.453
 Make the radish 90 degrees to the knife (diagonal part) of the kitchen knife 

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:40.273
 The key to Katsura-Muki is the ability to maintain the angle 

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:46.894
 Cut at the root of the kitchen knife 

00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:50.114
 With the cutting edge facing forward, make the radish and knife 90 degrees 

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:53.114
 Then it peels from the long bottom of the diameter 

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.114
 Always place your right thumb on the cutting edge 

00:00:56.114 --> 00:01:01.014
 Adjust the thickness with this thumb 

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.014
 How to move the kitchen knife 

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:07.474
 It is not a sense to cut, it is a sense to slide up and down 

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:11.494
 Slide the kitchen knife up and down and turn it by turning the radish 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 Make sure your left hand puts your thumb in front of the cutting edge 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 If the upper and lower diameters match, it will cut to the top 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.154
 Please make sure that the radish looks like a clean circle from above 

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:33.760
 Start from here 

00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:38.473
 Let's check if the upper and lower diameters are the same 

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:42.193
 Cut at the cutting edge 

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:51.714
 At first please cut when you move the kitchen knife up 

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:55.274
 Make the radish and cutting edge come under the thumb 

00:02:02.693 --> 00:02:06.873
 When you get used to it, let's cut it when lowering the kitchen knife 

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:16.814
 The thumb of the right hand is the best point 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.580
 Adjust the bottom thickness in the sense of the thumb 

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:27.433
 The upper side is thin and see through 

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.773
 You can adjust the thickness by changing the angle of the knife 

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:54.733
 If you want to thicken. Let's be careful not to break 

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:07.394
 The goal is to be able to adjust thick and thin, thin and adjust 

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:25.473
 If you get used to it, you can cut it at a stretch when you move the knife 

00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:32.293
 At first we slide small, but let's slide kitchen knife widely if used 

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:55.014
 It will end when the diameter of the radish is about 2 cm 

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:01.873
 I will roll from the peeled part 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.800
 Let's wind tightly 

00:04:27.993 --> 00:04:32.853
 Those cut in this state are called [swirl] or [Naruto] 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.940
 Let's divide again when making a sashimi garnish 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.920
