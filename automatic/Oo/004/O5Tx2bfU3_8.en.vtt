00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
low-cut filter as well right and you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
low-cut filter as well right and you
know<00:00:53.550> shotgun<00:00:54.300> mics<00:00:54.510> typically<00:00:55.020> emphasize

know shotgun mics typically emphasize

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.970 
know shotgun mics typically emphasize
bass<00:00:56.190> response<00:00:56.430> play<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:58.350> male<00:00:58.739> voices

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
bass response play and make male voices

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
bass response play and make male voices
kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> heavy<00:00:59.670> sound<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.300> we've

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
kind of heavy sound and so we've

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
kind of heavy sound and so we've
developed<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.949> nice<00:01:02.219> low-cut<00:01:02.789> filter

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
developed on this a nice low-cut filter

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
developed on this a nice low-cut filter
that<00:01:03.329> starts<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.080> higher<00:01:04.290> than<00:01:04.530> our

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that starts a little bit higher than our

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
that starts a little bit higher than our
competitors<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.400> rolls<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.880> more

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
competitors that rolls off more

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
competitors that rolls off more
gradually<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> give<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.409> natural<00:01:07.439> sound

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
gradually to give a more natural sound

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
gradually to give a more natural sound
quality<00:01:08.520> excellent<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> powering<00:01:10.049> obviously

it's<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.830> run<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.250> phantom<00:01:11.880> power<00:01:12.030> 48<00:01:12.600> volts

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it's gonna run on phantom power 48 volts

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's gonna run on phantom power 48 volts
they<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:13.470> will<00:01:13.740> run<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.070> battery<00:01:14.490> power<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
they also will run on battery power is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
they also will run on battery power is
right<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> dual<00:01:16.110> powered<00:01:16.650> shotgun

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
