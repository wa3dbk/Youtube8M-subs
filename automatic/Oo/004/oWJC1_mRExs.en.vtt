you do the outcome of the game as good
as<00:00:24.720> LSU<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.410> will<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.039> determined<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:27.210> we

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
as LSU was will be determined by how we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
as LSU was will be determined by how we
play<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
play in what we do and I think the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640 
play in what we do and I think the
players<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.179> responded<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.320> that

to<00:00:35.940> anybody<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.860> those<00:00:38.040> guys<00:00:38.250> as

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
to anybody but you know those guys as

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970 
to anybody but you know those guys as
motto<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.329> last<00:00:39.510> plane<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.410> last<00:00:40.649> bullet

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
motto was the last plane the last bullet

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
motto was the last plane the last bullet
the<00:00:41.250> last<00:00:41.460> man<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> last<00:00:42.239> minute<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.870> fight

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the last man the last minute we fight

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650 
the last man the last minute we fight
and<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.190> always<00:00:44.610> stay<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> mission<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and we always stay with the mission and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.569 
and we always stay with the mission and
I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.920> described<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I think that kind of described the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
I think that kind of described the
spirit<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.510> group<00:00:48.750> extremely<00:00:49.379> well<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
spirit of that group extremely well but

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
spirit of that group extremely well but
it<00:00:49.980> also<00:00:50.129> describes<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> spirit<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.050> know

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it also describes the spirit of you know

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
it also describes the spirit of you know
the<00:00:52.260> group<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> players<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.520> our

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the group of players that we have on our

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
the group of players that we have on our
team<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> year<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> takes<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.770> tremendous

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
team this year and takes a tremendous

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
team this year and takes a tremendous
amount<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.520> resiliency<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:58.109> come<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.010> was

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
amount of resiliency to come back it was

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
amount of resiliency to come back it was
tougher<00:00:59.640> losing<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> game<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
tougher losing the game and I think that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.439 
tougher losing the game and I think that
demonstrates<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> character<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> people

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
demonstrates the character of the people

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
demonstrates the character of the people
in<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> locker<00:01:04.049> room<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.830> come<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.189> from

and I think that was we certainly didn't

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.110 
and I think that was we certainly didn't
play<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.930> perfect<00:04:07.169> game<00:04:07.579> we<00:04:08.579> got<00:04:08.729> a<00:04:08.759> field<00:04:09.030> goal

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
play a perfect game we got a field goal

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.879 
play a perfect game we got a field goal
blocked<00:04:09.419> we<00:04:10.139> couldn't<00:04:10.379> score<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.650> touchdown

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
blocked we couldn't score a touchdown

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.789 
blocked we couldn't score a touchdown
for<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.340> long<00:04:11.519> time<00:04:11.819> but<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:13.109> guys<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.590> kept

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
for a long time but the guys just kept

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.399 
for a long time but the guys just kept
playing<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.370> never<00:04:14.819> never<00:04:15.359> once<00:04:15.750> was<00:04:16.019> anybody

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
playing and never never once was anybody

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.080 
playing and never never once was anybody
ever<00:04:16.620> discouraged<00:04:17.220> about<00:04:17.400> anything<00:04:17.759> that

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.480 
think that attitude prevailed for us as
a<00:04:21.959> team<00:04:22.049> we<00:04:22.590> were<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:22.830> going<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.039> play<00:04:23.250> one

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
a team we were just going to play one

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
regardless of what the circumstance was

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.360 
regardless of what the circumstance was
on<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.610> play<00:04:27.790> before<00:04:28.140> have<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.260> sort<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> an<00:04:30.250> I
