00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
nice I've only used this product twice

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.900 
nice I've only used this product twice
and<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.020> used<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.440> two<00:02:47.740> ways<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.700> under

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
and I used it two ways I use that under

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.370 
and I used it two ways I use that under
the<00:02:49.030> steamer<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.540> then<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.750> use<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> under<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
the steamer and then I use it under the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.890 
the steamer and then I use it under the
heating<00:02:50.680> cap<00:02:50.890> because<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.940> believe<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.870> be

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
heating cap because I believe that to be

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540 
heating cap because I believe that to be
most<00:02:53.200> effective<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.890> should<00:02:54.130> always<00:02:54.370> use

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
most effective you should always use

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.250 
most effective you should always use
heat<00:02:54.940> when<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.240> have<00:02:55.450> your<00:02:55.690> hair<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.080> deep

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
heat when you have your hair is deep

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.780 
heat when you have your hair is deep
conditioning<00:02:56.710> which<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.190> my<00:02:57.280> personal<00:02:57.700> belief

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
conditioning which is my personal belief

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.320 
conditioning which is my personal belief
and<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.530> will<00:02:59.890> say<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.400> under<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.730> steamer

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
and so I will say that under the steamer

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.620 
and so I will say that under the steamer
you<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.620> sort<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.100> amplifies<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.030> feeling<00:03:04.450> of

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
you it sort of amplifies that feeling of

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.740 
you it sort of amplifies that feeling of
timeliness<00:03:05.530> on<00:03:05.860> your<00:03:06.010> scalp<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:07.510> because

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
timeliness on your scalp I think because

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.150 
timeliness on your scalp I think because
the<00:03:07.870> air<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.200> hitting<00:03:08.320> your<00:03:08.560> scalp<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.070> then

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the air is hitting your scalp and then

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.830 
the air is hitting your scalp and then
you<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> steam<00:03:09.760> whereas<00:03:10.209> when<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> went

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
you have the steam whereas when I went

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.449 
you have the steam whereas when I went
under<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> shower<00:03:11.410> cap<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:12.070> under<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
under a shower cap and then under the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.400 
under a shower cap and then under the
heating<00:03:12.760> cap<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.209> still<00:03:13.720> felt<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.110> tingling

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
heating cap I still felt the tingling

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.920 
heating cap I still felt the tingling
but<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.130> wasn't<00:03:15.459> as<00:03:15.670> strong<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.420> prefer<00:03:16.720> to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
but it wasn't as strong so I prefer to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.740 
but it wasn't as strong so I prefer to
be<00:03:17.200> under<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.530> steamer<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.970> product<00:03:19.570> left

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
be under the steamer this product left

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.729 
be under the steamer this product left

very very well moisturized I was very

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.490 
very very well moisturized I was very
impressed<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:27.600> how<00:03:28.600> well<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:29.020> worked<00:03:29.200> for<00:03:29.320> my

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
impressed with how well it worked for my

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.949 
impressed with how well it worked for my
hair<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:30.430> does<00:03:30.730> contain<00:03:31.180> mineral<00:03:31.690> oil<00:03:31.870> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
hair it does contain mineral oil and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.820 
hair it does contain mineral oil and
typically<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:34.989> try<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.440> stay<00:03:35.620> away<00:03:35.800> from

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
typically I try to stay away from

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.520 
typically I try to stay away from
products<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.520> mineral<00:03:36.880> oil<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.270> them

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
products that have mineral oil in them

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.830 
products that have mineral oil in them
but<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.560> gave<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.950> try<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:40.269> will<00:03:40.480> say<00:03:40.630> that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
but I gave it a try and I will say that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.080 
but I gave it a try and I will say that
I<00:03:40.900> liked<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:42.040> gave<00:03:42.220> my<00:03:42.340> hair<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.550> lot<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.790> slip

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
I liked it it gave my hair a lot of slip

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.449 
I liked it it gave my hair a lot of slip
when<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.690> was<00:03:43.930> detangling<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.709> was<00:03:44.830> able<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.160> go

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
