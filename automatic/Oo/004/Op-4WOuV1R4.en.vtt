00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.820 
computer that allows you to create iso
files<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.290> i'm<00:04:36.380> going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.560> go<00:04:36.620> ahead<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
files so i'm going to go ahead and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.150 
files so i'm going to go ahead and
capture<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.310> iso<00:04:38.470> see<00:04:39.470> where'd<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.830> put<00:04:39.860> my<00:04:40.130> eye

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
capture the iso see where'd I put my eye

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.710 
capture the iso see where'd I put my eye
so<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.790> my<00:04:40.910> backup<00:04:41.590> partition<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.940> it's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
so it's on my backup partition and it's

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.020 
so it's on my backup partition and it's
right<00:04:45.170> here<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.590> can<00:04:45.740> see<00:04:45.920> a<00:04:45.950> dose<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:46.670> if<00:04:46.880> I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
right here you can see a dose I so if I

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.620 
right here you can see a dose I so if I
want<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> click<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.650> click<00:04:48.650> open<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.630> now

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
want to click that click open and now

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.870 
want to click that click open and now
I'm<00:04:50.990> going<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> have<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.680> reboot<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.430> virtual

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
I'm going to have to reboot this virtual

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.580 
I'm going to have to reboot this virtual
machine<00:04:53.240> in<00:04:53.390> order<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.660> do<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:53.990> come<00:04:54.320> up<00:04:54.440> here

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
machine in order to do that come up here

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.670 
machine in order to do that come up here
to<00:04:54.650> action<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.450> click<00:04:56.450> on<00:04:56.660> control<00:04:57.350> alt

to action and click on control alt

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.040 
to action and click on control alt
delete<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:58.580> will<00:04:58.790> reboot<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.720> virtual

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
delete this will reboot the virtual

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.190 
delete this will reboot the virtual
machine<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.760> it<00:05:01.760> will<00:05:01.970> use<00:05:02.180> my<00:05:02.510> little<00:05:02.780> iso

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
machine and it will use my little iso

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.980 
machine and it will use my little iso
file<00:05:03.470> which<00:05:04.460> is<00:05:04.490> going<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.790> start<00:05:05.090> windows<00:05:05.480> 98
