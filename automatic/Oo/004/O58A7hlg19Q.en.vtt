quality plastic I was expecting to be a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970 
quality plastic I was expecting to be a
bit<00:00:41.610> cheap<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> runs<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.200> four<00:00:43.680> AAA

hot<00:00:54.000> shoe<00:00:54.210> adapter<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.199> I'll<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.620> top

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
hot shoe adapter there so I'll go on top

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.060 
hot shoe adapter there so I'll go on top
with<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> camera<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> biggest<00:00:58.170> drawback

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
with a camera the biggest drawback

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
with a camera the biggest drawback
probably<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> on/off<00:01:00.210> switch<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
probably is the on/off switch it's so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.270 
probably is the on/off switch it's so
easy<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> actuate<00:01:03.470> let's<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.920> demo
