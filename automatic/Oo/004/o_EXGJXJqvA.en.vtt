hey wassup everybody its sauce and

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey wassup everybody its sauce and
there's<00:00:04.080> been<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.259> lot<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.529> hype<00:00:04.770> lately<00:00:05.190> about

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
there's been a lot of hype lately about

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.690 
there's been a lot of hype lately about
this<00:00:05.990> permanent<00:00:06.990> Juggernog<00:00:07.230> perk<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.220> have

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
this permanent Juggernog perk and have

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.490 
this permanent Juggernog perk and have
actually<00:00:09.000> been<00:00:09.120> doing<00:00:09.389> some<00:00:09.570> researching<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
actually been doing some researching and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.740 
actually been doing some researching and
it's<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:10.950> really<00:00:11.250> permanent<00:00:11.580> because<00:00:12.179> when<00:00:12.630> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it's not really permanent because when I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.330 
it's not really permanent because when I
turned<00:00:13.049> off<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.200> xbox<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.950> went<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.190> did

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
turned off my xbox and went and did

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
turned off my xbox and went and did
something<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:15.000> came<00:00:15.269> back<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:16.170> will<00:00:16.289> be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
something and then came back it will be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.859 
something and then came back it will be
gone<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.920> i<00:00:17.699> think<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.750> get

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
gone and i think it's just when you get

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.310 
gone and i think it's just when you get
passed<00:00:19.170> around<00:00:19.380> 15<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> goes<00:00:20.490> away<00:00:20.840> because<00:00:21.840> if

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
passed around 15 it goes away because if

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.279 
passed around 15 it goes away because if
you're<00:00:22.949> dying<00:00:23.490> around<00:00:23.850> 15<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> lot<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.019> i

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you're dying around 15 a lot then i

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
you're dying around 15 a lot then i
guess<00:00:25.619> they'll<00:00:25.949> give<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> permanent<00:00:26.699> jug<00:00:26.910> or

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
guess they'll give you permanent jug or

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
guess they'll give you permanent jug or
a<00:00:27.390> consistent<00:00:28.080> joke<00:00:28.380> i<00:00:28.560> could<00:00:28.710> i<00:00:28.920> should<00:00:29.130> say

so then after this I went and tried it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
so then after this I went and tried it
in<00:01:04.710> die<00:01:04.979> rise<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
in die rise and it did work you see I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.920 
in die rise and it did work you see I
can<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.189> hits<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> third<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.450> get

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can take two hits and on the third I get

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
can take two hits and on the third I get
pretty<00:01:10.110> injured<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> fourth

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
pretty injured and then on the fourth

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
pretty injured and then on the fourth
I'm<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.960> doubles<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.500> health<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'm down so it doubles your health and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
I'm down so it doubles your health and
then<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.030> jug<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
then when you do get jug I think you can

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.760 
then when you do get jug I think you can
take<00:01:16.590> six<00:01:16.950> hits<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:18.049> one<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
take six hits which is one more than you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
take six hits which is one more than you
could<00:01:19.890> take<00:01:20.270> I'm<00:01:21.270> sorry<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.900> too

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
could take I'm sorry I think it's too

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
could take I'm sorry I think it's too
more<00:01:22.290> than<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.650> regularly<00:01:23.159> take<00:01:23.549> with

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
more than you could regularly take with

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
more than you could regularly take with
a<00:01:23.909> jug<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.049> very<00:01:25.320> very<00:01:25.680> useful<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a jug so it is very very useful but you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
a jug so it is very very useful but you
have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
have to basically do this thing and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
have to basically do this thing and
transit<00:01:29.400> every<00:01:29.640> time<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> use<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
transit every time you want to use it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
transit every time you want to use it
and<00:01:30.750> die<00:01:31.020> rise<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and die rise but that's not really a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
and die rise but that's not really a
problem<00:01:32.579> because<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.750> difficult

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
problem because it's not very difficult

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
problem because it's not very difficult
to<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.430> usually<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.210> your

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to do and you can usually get it on your

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.660 
to do and you can usually get it on your
first<00:01:36.630> try<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.710> does<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.310> work<00:01:38.640> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
first try and this does also work for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.420 
first try and this does also work for
ps3<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> fooling

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
ps3 so here I'm just kind of fooling

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
ps3 so here I'm just kind of fooling
around<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.820> transit<00:01:42.240> after<00:01:43.049> I've<00:01:43.229> gotten<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
around and transit after I've gotten it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.050 
around and transit after I've gotten it
and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.340> kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.939> myself

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and then I'm just kind of down on myself

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then I'm just kind of down on myself
after<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.680> anyway<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
after this I think but anyway so if it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.490 
after this I think but anyway so if it
does<00:01:47.970> work<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> die<00:01:48.509> rise<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.079> i'm<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
