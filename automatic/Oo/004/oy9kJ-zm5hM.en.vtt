00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.040
 iris gt today will be a creative block and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 Although my favorite jeans that is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 just my super favorite jeans for 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.520
 the summer and had two holes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 the front push the relatively nice way 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.029
 certain things were as I like that very much 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 but now they are striving for me or 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 everything has worked out and the holes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.980
 are getting bigger and I like that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 I do not feel young for it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 So that's how they came up and me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.829
 I have a patch under there now 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.079
 set and how to do that I want 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
 Show you tomorrow with yes 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.750
 to get to know so yes the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.730
 Sewing machine not ran 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.219
 Often it is the narrow spot of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 fine no chance because somehow with the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.329
 Sewing machine outside to take so what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 we have to do it is one side 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.800
 Although one jeans always has two 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 pages 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.460
 So you see two culprits, one approaching 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.949
 is always sewn twice and the others 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.250
 Art is normal and the normal 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.490
 that just goes genetically when I go on 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 and so in the height where just this 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 hole is now I separate times as a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 knife and go there carefully between 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:26.090
 the stitching is easy 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 divide 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.840
 that would have to do a whole bit 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 then again with the machine and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.040
 Rhein comes as carefully as possible then 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.730
 again the night does not tear up like that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.770
 washed and already too thin there if you 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.770
 once inside is broken 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.450
 So it's enough , I still have it now 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.450
 what I like 25 cm 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.770
 I am now mend my jeans 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.760
 says it over there and puts it 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:27.760
 firmly and then simply the mend was 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.320
 sewn in and looks it over now 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.440
 now norisbank must rise again 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.390
 thereby, it is because it is repeated 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.780
 and put it exactly on the seam and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.700
 slippery just over it 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.090
 the seam meets the one who has separated 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.950
 then it looks like you can see it at all 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.370
 not that something had been done to it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.580
 so and my hole is to it though 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.470
 still, of course, but the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.230
 this time we are the teenagers theirs 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.209
 I have to trust jeans wide open 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 not that 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.060
 So I'm going to be my favorite jeans 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.910
 put it on again and that 's it quick and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.200
 easy today in the creative block up 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.200
