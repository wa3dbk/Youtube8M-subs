00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:40.249 

Oh<00:01:34.229> each<00:01:35.229> item<00:01:35.710> has<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.890> different<00:01:36.250> point<00:01:36.400> value

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:50.639

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
enemies by running into them I think

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.630
