tutorial<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.650> today<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.089> how<00:00:06.569> to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
tutorial and today is going to be how to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.970 
tutorial and today is going to be how to
create<00:00:07.440> ghost<00:00:08.280> platforms<00:00:09.269> now<00:00:09.750> if<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.320> if<00:00:10.860> you

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
create ghost platforms now if you if you

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.680 
create ghost platforms now if you if you
don't<00:00:11.099> know<00:00:11.190> ghost<00:00:11.519> platforms<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.240> basically

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
don't know ghost platforms are basically

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
don't know ghost platforms are basically
if<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.990> ever<00:00:13.170> play<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> doodle<00:00:13.920> jump<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.480> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
if you ever play a doodle jump on the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960 
if you ever play a doodle jump on the
iPod<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.289> something<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.760> can

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
iPod or something like that you can

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.070 
iPod or something like that you can
actually<00:00:18.150> jump<00:00:18.690> through<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:21.000> block<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.779> up

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
actually jump through the block going up

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.269 
actually jump through the block going up
but<00:00:22.890> when<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.160> come<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.850> uh<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.740> can't

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but when you come back down uh you can't

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.019 
but when you come back down uh you can't
go<00:00:26.340> through<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.930> um<00:00:28.400> yeah<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.760> pretty

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
go through it um yeah so that's pretty

uh so what I've done is I went ahead and
created<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.559> simple<00:00:37.040> platformer<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
created a simple platformer and if you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
created a simple platformer and if you
don't<00:00:39.149> know<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> platformer<00:00:40.290> go

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
don't know how to do a platformer go

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.690 
don't know how to do a platformer go
ahead<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.680> check<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> link<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.670> the

ahead and continue so let me just name
this<00:00:50.460> player<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> don't<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.180> why<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> didn't<00:00:52.110> do

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
this player I don't know why I didn't do

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.310 
this player I don't know why I didn't do
that<00:00:52.379> before<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> we're<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.199> ahead

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that before so we're going to go ahead

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
that before so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:55.649> create<00:00:55.860> our<00:00:55.949> ghost<00:00:56.190> platform<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.820> now

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and create our ghost platform here now

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
and create our ghost platform here now
what<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> did<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.170> went<00:00:58.199> ahead<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> created

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
what I did is I went ahead and created

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
what I did is I went ahead and created
the<00:00:59.010> sprite<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> 32<00:01:00.030> by<00:01:00.180> 8<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.739> could

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the sprite it's a 32 by 8 and it could

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
the sprite it's a 32 by 8 and it could
be<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.100> any<00:01:02.430> size<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.899> picked

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
be any any size really I just picked

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.299 
be any any size really I just picked
that<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.250> different

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that just because they look different

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
that just because they look different
than<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> other<00:01:06.119> blocks<00:01:06.530> or<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.860> other

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
than the other blocks or this other

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.350 
than the other blocks or this other
block<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.869> didn't<00:01:10.260> Center<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
block here and I didn't Center it so

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
block here and I didn't Center it so
that's<00:01:12.360> something<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.850> now

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that's something to think of there now

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.039 
that's something to think of there now
it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.150> matter<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> Center<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> or

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it doesn't matter if you Center it or

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
it doesn't matter if you Center it or
not<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> yeah<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.450> ahead<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
not so yeah so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
not so yeah so I'm going to go ahead and
create<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.500> ghost<00:01:20.270> platform<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:23.430> ahead

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
create the ghost platform and go ahead

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
create the ghost platform and go ahead
and<00:01:23.640> give<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> sprite<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and give it the sprite and I'm going to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.749 
and give it the sprite and I'm going to
make<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> solid<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:28.159> basically<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.549> our

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
make it solid and basically with our

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.300 
make it solid and basically with our
collision<00:01:30.329> code<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> we're<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.530> has

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
collision code that we're using it has

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
collision code that we're using it has
to<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> solid<00:01:34.130> type<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> block<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.850> order<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to be a solid type of block in order to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
to be a solid type of block in order to
actually<00:01:36.869> land<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.520> jump

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
actually land on it and not just jump

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
actually land on it and not just jump
through<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.320> idea<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:41.040> we're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
through it so the idea of what we're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
through it so the idea of what we're
going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.360> going

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
going to be doing here is we are going

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
going to be doing here is we are going
to<00:01:42.810> check<00:01:43.229> whether<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.250> player<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to check whether or not our player is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
to check whether or not our player is
going<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.200> direction<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
going in the up direction and if it is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.780 
going in the up direction and if it is
then<00:01:48.180> we're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> switch<00:01:49.049> solid<00:01:49.799> off<00:01:49.979> on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
then we're going to switch solid off on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
then we're going to switch solid off on
the<00:01:50.970> ghost<00:01:51.149> platform<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.990> he's<00:01:52.170> coming

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the ghost platform and if he's coming

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.499 
the ghost platform and if he's coming
down<00:01:52.740> we're<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> switch<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:56.509> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
down we're going to switch it on so in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.109 
down we're going to switch it on so in
our<00:01:58.500> obj<00:01:58.979> player<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.549> we're<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.850> do<00:01:59.969> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
our obj player what we're going to do is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
our obj player what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.689> say<00:02:00.899> well<00:02:01.200> first<00:02:01.619> off

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
we're going to just say well first off

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
we're going to just say well first off
let<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.219> show<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> obj

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
let me just show you that in the obj

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.880 
let me just show you that in the obj
block<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> collision<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.740> we're

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
block this is the collision that we're

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.779 
block this is the collision that we're
using<00:02:05.070> move<00:02:05.880> contact<00:02:06.329> solid<00:02:06.810> direction<00:02:07.590> 12<00:02:08.310> V

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
using move contact solid direction 12 V

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.449 
using move contact solid direction 12 V
speed<00:02:09.090> equals<00:02:09.539> zero<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.310> be

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
speed equals zero and that's going to be

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.390 
speed equals zero and that's going to be
the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.990 
the
the<00:02:13.400> closure<00:02:13.670> code<00:02:13.910> we're<00:02:14.030> using<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
the closure code we're using for the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.090 
the closure code we're using for the
ghost<00:02:17.300> platform<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.380> let<00:02:18.470> me<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:19.010> ahead

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
ghost platform so let me just go ahead

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.380 
ghost platform so let me just go ahead
and<00:02:19.400> press<00:02:19.580> ok

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
and press ok

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.960 
and press ok
there<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:22.430> ahead<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.670> put<00:02:22.880> in

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
there all right so go ahead and put in

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.460 
there all right so go ahead and put in
some<00:02:23.000> code<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:24.110> make<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> little

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
some code here just make it a little

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.420 
some code here just make it a little
bigger<00:02:27.190> there<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.340> go<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.650> again<00:02:30.650> what<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.100> said

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
bigger there we go and again what I said

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.730 
bigger there we go and again what I said
is<00:02:31.550> we're<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.970> check<00:02:32.570> whether<00:02:33.230> or<00:02:33.380> not

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
is we're going to check whether or not

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.530 
is we're going to check whether or not
we<00:02:34.190> are<00:02:34.220> going<00:02:34.370> up<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:34.940> down<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.420> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
we are going up or down and that is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.020 
we are going up or down and that is
going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.990> on<00:02:36.230> V<00:02:36.650> speed<00:02:37.010> vertical<00:02:37.760> speed

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
going to be on V speed vertical speed

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.140 
going to be on V speed vertical speed
and<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.020> just<00:02:39.920> checking<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.520> up<00:02:40.760> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and that is just checking the up and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.030 
and that is just checking the up and
down<00:02:41.450> speed<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.380> negative<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.980> means

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
down speed if it's negative that means

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.949 
down speed if it's negative that means
we're<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.610> up<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.209> positive<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
we're going up if it's positive that

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.729 
we're going up if it's positive that
means<00:02:45.140> we're<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:45.709> down<00:02:46.300> okay<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.989> what

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
means we're going down okay so what

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.290 
means we're going down okay so what
we're<00:02:48.860> going<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.070> be<00:02:49.190> doing<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.670> first<00:02:50.090> off

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
we're going to be doing is first off

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.210 
we're going to be doing is first off
we're<00:02:50.510> going<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.810> check<00:02:51.380> whether<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:52.100> are

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
we're going to check whether we are

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.710 
we're going to check whether we are
going<00:02:52.370> down<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.000> if<00:02:53.239> V<00:02:53.800> speed<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:55.480> greater<00:02:56.480> than

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
going down so if V speed is greater than

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.050 
going down so if V speed is greater than
or<00:02:56.930> equal<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.560> zero<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.580> number<00:02:58.820> he<00:02:58.940> can

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
or equal to zero because number he can

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.650 
or equal to zero because number he can
land<00:02:59.269> on<00:02:59.510> it<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:02.180> we're<00:03:02.269> going<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.420> go<00:03:02.540> and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
land on it then we're going to go and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.780 
land on it then we're going to go and
put<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.019> rackets<00:03:03.380> here<00:03:03.610> we're<00:03:04.610> going<00:03:04.730> to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
put in some rackets here we're going to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.860 
put in some rackets here we're going to
say<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.709> obj<00:03:06.850> ghost<00:03:07.850> platform<00:03:10.870> goes

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
say with obj ghost platform goes

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:22.150 
say with obj ghost platform goes
platform<00:03:16.930> solid<00:03:18.519> equals<00:03:19.519> true<00:03:20.650> okay<00:03:21.650> that's

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
platform solid equals true okay that's

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.650 
platform solid equals true okay that's
all<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.459> really<00:03:22.610> have<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.940> do<00:03:23.060> for<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.450> and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
all you really have to do for that and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.319 
all you really have to do for that and
we<00:03:24.590> obviously<00:03:24.799> have<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.310> put<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.940> our<00:03:26.860> our

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
we obviously have to put in our our

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.350 
we obviously have to put in our our
direction<00:03:29.329> or<00:03:29.720> our<00:03:30.400> collision<00:03:31.400> methods<00:03:32.209> here

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
direction or our collision methods here

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.380 
direction or our collision methods here
and<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:32.690> be<00:03:32.870> speed<00:03:33.140> equals<00:03:33.440> zero<00:03:34.360> okay<00:03:35.360> so

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
and then be speed equals zero okay so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.660 
and then be speed equals zero okay so
that<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.019> if<00:03:36.290> you're<00:03:36.440> going<00:03:36.650> down<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:37.489> is

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
that is if you're going down that is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.910 
that is if you're going down that is
going<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.000> happen<00:03:38.170> okay<00:03:39.170> now<00:03:39.590> we're<00:03:39.739> going<00:03:39.829> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
going to happen okay now we're going to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.390 
going to happen okay now we're going to
say<00:03:40.070> else<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.350> else<00:03:42.350> if<00:03:43.600> V<00:03:44.600> speed<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.200> less<00:03:46.130> than

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
say else so else if V speed is less than

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.569 
say else so else if V speed is less than
zero<00:03:46.700> which<00:03:46.790> means<00:03:47.030> we're<00:03:47.239> going<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:49.430> put

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
zero which means we're going up and put

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.650 
zero which means we're going up and put
in<00:03:49.670> some<00:03:49.790> brackets<00:03:49.940> here<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:52.090> obj<00:03:53.090> ghost

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
in some brackets here with obj ghost

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.350 
in some brackets here with obj ghost
platform

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360

solid equals come on guess it false

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.790 
solid equals come on guess it false
there<00:04:03.290> we<00:04:03.470> go

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
there we go

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.170 
there we go
and<00:04:05.590> basically<00:04:06.590> that's<00:04:06.950> about<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.610> here<00:04:08.000> let

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
and basically that's about it here let

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.920 
and basically that's about it here let
me<00:04:08.210> go<00:04:08.360> ahead<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.630> put<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.200> in<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.440> room<00:04:09.620> here

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
me go ahead and put it in the room here

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.260 
me go ahead and put it in the room here
just<00:04:11.930> put<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.140> couple<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.590> room<00:04:14.980> okay<00:04:15.980> and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
just put a couple in the room okay and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.870 
just put a couple in the room okay and
I'm<00:04:17.270> going<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.780> go<00:04:17.840> ahead<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.110> play<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.320> here
