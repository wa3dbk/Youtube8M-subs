00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.860
 very good kids here you have another 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.540
 myth that I know you love and this time 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.669
 is related to the amount of combis 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.290
 that come by round you know that I have 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.179
 some tablets in which the 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.769
 zombies that come and such but is 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.389
 discovering after recording all this 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.129
 that are not completely accurate what I 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.650
 I did for myself yes because that also 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.330
 I was checking myself and such but those that 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.830
 I took the internet for four players not 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.840
 they are precise at all so those who 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.720
 are using them keep it in mind 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.269
 that are not going to be precise at all anymore or 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.630
 less yes but ojito is worth saying 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.800
 this the myth to see when you can 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 make a record for example of three 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.680
 beaches and one goes the connection by 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.420
 put an example in round 20 then there's 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 many people who believe that from that 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.180
 round the other two that remain in the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.970
 departure are going to have to eat all 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.560
 the combis of three players and it's not like that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.170
 it's worth what I've said it ever in 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.310
 some direct and such but never had 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.440
 confirmed he had never shown 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.110
 well in this video you are going to see what are you going 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 see it pretty clear 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.790
 whenever someone leaves the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.830
 commission a round of such that round will 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.320
 will end the zombies that touch the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.710
 remaining zombies are already up to the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.300
 order 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.920
 sent as if we said by the game 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.170
 ok but when the next one starts 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.970
 round the marker is changed instead of 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.860
 four players or three nodes that are 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.300
 one less something the people who have 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.120
 fallen as if two people fall 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 they will be for everyone for the players 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.600
 less well well said that first nothing 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.890
 explain if you drop the game 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.410
 before starting that you have seen that I 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.759
 there it gave him initiate and we were four and 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.780
 now we are three is worth because one is 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.509
 it freezes the play 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.040
 well, being that way, it also counts as 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.360
 that we have started with three beaches 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.890
 valencianas the comics that are going to come 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.680
 now they are the three players who were 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.720
 If I remember correctly, it's ok and today I was 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.790
 pointing to everything and everything I realized 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.940
 then I knew there's detail 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.010
 that out there next we cut this in 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.190
 the next 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.870
 ok here you see that we went to round 6 and 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.940
 we are three beaches you have left us in 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.180
 none of the game and we have then 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.550
 as you see there 32 zombies 26 and 36 that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.030
 we killed so well do this 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.490
 total of 94 zombies and when the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.700
 round that I'm going to stick around here will be 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.940
 more or less here here when the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.190
 round we have this we have 43 41 and 48 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 it's worth a total of 132 zombies 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.860
 which means that they have come 38 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.190
 zombies in round 6 of 3 players worth 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.730
 Well, here I have all these cuts 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.040
 here we have you see how we have there 25 47 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.380
 21 and such and that is going to come out I think it's 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.630
 also the one that will be in this case and we 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 we are going to be with 25 and 21 that when 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.640
 die the last zombie are going to be 26 and 21 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.260
 worth a total of 47 zombies well al 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.730
 end of this round you see how I was 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 coming out we were debating who was 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.470
 went out and going then at the end of this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.130
 round that I'll have it around here pretty much 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.750
 there is already coming and such 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.040
 we made the round between us 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.980
 players and that and there was a total of 41 37 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.580
 of 78 zombies what you want to say is that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.320
 in being 41 plus 37 if what you want 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.390
 to say is that in this round damage 31 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.690
 valuable zombies round 6 of two beaches 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.160
 has been 31 zombies being round 5 of 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.310
 three valuable beaches having been before 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.290
 to start the round and the one before 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.620
 had changed or they had come 36 in 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.080
 summary that is a bit of a mess if there is no 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.170
 in the previous parliament by not getting out 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.400
 nobody comes out in 38 zombies in total 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.960
 ok and in this one when leaving round 5 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.210
 then start the 6 with only two 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.980
 players come 31 are visual what 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.050
 it means that yes they subtract that 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.660
 stop running that hoax that there is 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.190
 there that of that not of that it touches you 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.480
 eat you are digital everything because 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.310
 will take us here what you just saw 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.110
 although we have made the cuts and such but 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.010
 let's go or do not need no need 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.439
 see everything from the pull 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.090
 and finally tell you that it cost me 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.680
 pretty much record this or achieve 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.290
 some subscribers that were the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.030
 true good people thank all of you 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
 I do not remember the name exactly but 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.290
 you are not seeing it there 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.180
 markers and that and tell you that ya 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.370
 I wanted to bring him a little deeper and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.840
 such but you really did not see anything else and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.909
 every time I tried to record something else 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
 I ate a cape worth because we have to 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.930
 be very careful not to eat 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.489
 no end because if you could not 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.989
 count well then every time I wanted 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 re -record something to make it 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.370
 more clear something like that I ate a more corporal 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.199
 so I said look here as it is 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.240
 Of course I'm going to leave me nonsense and so 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.220
 least I think that people then always 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.900
 another myth any myth that you know 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.130
 I have several vouchers I have several that I 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.479
 you have put in previous videos but 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.520
 good new one that comes to mind 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.990
 even if it interests you or is simply 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.090
 a curiosity because it really is 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.760
 series also these curiosities me the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.750
 you put out there what we found out it's worth nothing 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.750
 more laura kids
