00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.650
 to a new video from the game with 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.410
 toys 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.230
 Now that I sand the kinetics 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.969
 I have made a sign of baff 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 times a direct comparison to the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 super sand I have right now a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.539
 bit the bottled and going now 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 just the same shape 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 use as we did in the last video 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.670
 Studying at the rate of sand 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.470
 so have the great sand here in the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.470
 Fill brandenburg gate 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.809
 what does not it notice the great sand so 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 sticky is still in total 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 kind of a bit drier and somehow 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 dusty of the rate was seen 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 somehow a bit moister I have 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 the feeling does not stay that much either 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.579
 The hands stick to the residues 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.079
 if you are here now 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:58.289
 kneads so I think now we have the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.190
 super sand pressed firmly and now 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.539
 you will overthrow the brandenburger tor 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.299
 so we make a direct comparison on 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.270
 now crashes the great sand 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.240
 brandenburg gate next to the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 kinetik sand or burgert watch what me 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 noticed at the kinetik sand 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 you could somehow easier the sand 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.659
 support it now as the super sand it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 took a bit longer but 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.320
 all the details are the same 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 beautiful from both sand variants 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 we just look like that now 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 keep working that way next 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.409
 then we make the reichstag with the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.409
 are super 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.460
 I believe our super sanders now 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 pressed hard enough and now the will 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.250
 Reichstag crashed so now ours 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.670
 great sound Reichstag I find it 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 She looks really good like her 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.079
 here 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.640
 the dome and something then signs off 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.970
 It looks quite natural in snow-white 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.880
 also a bit more chic 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.980
 Finally we try ours now 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.540
 tv tower and then we are as 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090
 Last we'll try ours 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 tv tower and then we are with the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.340
 compare as far as already finished and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.790
 then the evaluation comes as well 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:35.860
 had the topping with the super sand 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:39.959
 fill the top I forget and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.959
 now rush the alex 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.990
 I think it looks really great 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 do you guys here you see ours now 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.660
 results from the direct comparison 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.930
 from super sand left and right next 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.550
 kinetik sand i think the two can 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.840
 really let themselves be seen 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.170
 you barely see one 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 difference except in the color finds 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.510
 on the left the super santos knows he is working 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.020
 so a bit of plaster and right of the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.459
 kinetics sand is brown 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.489
 otherwise the one to be super 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.040
 a bit drier I think and 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.000
 dusty and kinetics sand is in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.830
 like a bit of water and wetter 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 So more like real sand, I think 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.630
 and now if you look at the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.540
 can shift two is the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.950
 work so unstable are the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.690
 Both sands are not included 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.520
 We now have the Brandenburg Gate 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.340
 already worked out the differences 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.950
 at the Reichstag, that behaves 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.010
 Actually you can already see a few here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.420
 tears but the kinetics of his team have 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.650
 I made it first too 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.519
 some crazy times 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.600
 probably also the list and here 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.000
 you really do not see any 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.769
 great difference 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.870
 I would say the great sand and the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.560
 kinetics sand and definitely too 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.700
 recommend 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.040
 I can actually 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.299
 decide which one is better except that 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.579
 Maybe if you want more 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.100
 he also wants to have the country feeling 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.709
 kinetik attacks first because the sand 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.440
 second, it has a bit of color 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.190
 It feels more like sand, but that's just it 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.989
 a matter of taste 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.540
 I have of my video has you 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.370
 please give me a thumbs up 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.650
 leave me a nice comment 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.490
 of course not in channels 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.639
 to subscribe 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.569
 See you next time 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.569
 bye
