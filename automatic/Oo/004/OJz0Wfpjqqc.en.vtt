00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.800
 unboxing a phone for everyone 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.900
 known I imagine in the world of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 technology and notice them 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.520
 penetrated in technology is the iphone 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.520
 5 s 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.270
 iphone 5 is 16 gigs with color 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.840
 silver white with silver 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.300
 let's see a little the unboxing and the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.730
 characteristics of the latest model 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.010
 iphone that has taken out that took out apple in 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.140
 October and that comes to my hands by the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.720
 assignment of a friend who will be bought and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.250
 lets you do the unboxing with which 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.990
 we go there and we are going to comment on a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.990
 little features 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.380
 plastic outside 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.750
 we go there minimalist hunting as always 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 those of apple white boxes 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.180
 and the first thing we find is the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.159
 terminal the terminal as I said 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.720
 White 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.800
 the silver model 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.800
 silver from behind 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 silver edges then we'll see more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.980
 near 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.520
 and this is a bit 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.649
 the terminal is worth 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 let's keep taking out the things that are 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.200
 inside and then we will analyze the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.530
 characteristics that brings more then the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.240
 cable 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.390
 lighting on this side usb in this vale 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 to connect to the computer or if it does not stop 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.550
 load it as is this extreme case 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.750
 charger or with usb 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.320
 we plug in here and we load the phone 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.820
 more things pot for me one of the 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.910
 best headphones there today 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.340
 for for my super comfortable ears you hear 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 very well I have tried different models and 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.950
 I see them super comfortable, I do not know 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.319
 they fall from my ear they do not hurt me 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.080
 and besides they are not not studied so easy 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.750
 like those of the iphone4 4s that still 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.120
 I have and they are automatic after 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 have the materials in the washing machine 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.200
 wanting and staying clean right away 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.670
 they get dirty again good 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.510
 then this is what we have iphone 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.860
 airports cable light in usb and charger 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.150
 let's go now a little to see the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.750
 phone features of this 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 phone is worth 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 and that has brought us back the company 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.990
 of cupertino 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.940
 well once we got it out of the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.150
 box we go with the features 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:35.420
 high measures 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:41.740
 12 38 centimeters wide 5 86 only 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.680
 thickness width 586 thickness 0 76 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.980
 and weight 112 grams light where there are 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.710
 it is very light it takes a processor to 7 the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.690
 same that I have mounted the ipad the only 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.960
 movement processor in 7 that 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:01.350
 still have to see what utility is 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.350
 will be able to give wifi bluetooth 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:10.740
 the entire quadband camera of 8 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.370
 Megapixels and side with a 15% sensor 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.430
 larger and the pixels capture 30% 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.970
 more light than the iphone 5 to dry a 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.250
 totally renovated flash that gets 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.320
 some super natural skin tones in the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.800
 scale if you search in google see the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.490
 differences with respect to 5 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.889
 final iphone 5 plus things 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.210
 the opening of the lens I forgot 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.210
 tell you is f 22 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.980
 has autofocus stabilizer 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.040
 a stabilizer that improves it a lot 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.050
 recorded video 1080 36 per second and 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.150
 the face and the novelty in the video is to 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.510
 720 we got slow motion at 120 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.510
 frames per second 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.780
 12 megapixel front camera for 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.570
 do face time or sky for whatever you want 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 what more good does he bring from 27 with 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.990
 yes or to the head and a little what is the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.600
 botonera because here is the novelty 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.190
 touch side and the fingerprint detector for 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.580
 the unlocking and even buying of 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.000
 applications we will see how you configure it and 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.970
 how does the button work to go down and 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.970
 turn up volume this lever to 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.120
 remove the sound from the mobile band we have 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.720
 said rear camera with its flash camera 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.720
 lead 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.780
 microphone speaker jack connector and the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.590
 lighting connector 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.810
 and in principle this is all about this 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.600
 terminal now what I have left is 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.200
 understand it set up with my account 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.380
 iTunes and appstore as you want to call it 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.620
 and give it a shot and see what it is that we 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.990
 gives battery level performance and 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.970
 especially how are the applications that 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.669
 they are adapting to ios 7 in this 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.550
 terminal that is receiving by parts 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.440
 equal praise and criticism 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.530
 different sectors as this has been 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.530
 everything up to the next video a greeting
