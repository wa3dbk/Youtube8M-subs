00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 how long has it been since 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 he lost his name his ruinous mind no longer 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 they remember it vaguely is capable of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 remembering standard armor and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.629
 comrades with somber faces 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.110
 riding by his side he also remembers 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.420
 a hard battle pain and fear when 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 pale hands pulled him from his 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.089
 mount 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 remember the terror of when it was 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.409
 thrown into the abyss of the dead god together 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.290
 to his brothers to listen to the singing 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.840
 funeral and be consumed by nothing in 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.350
 the dark depths lost the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 notion of time your thoughts them 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.619
 they abandoned sanity left them 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.940
 they attacked each other with their nails 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.550
 shattered and their teeth shattered 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:34.320
 then an instant came at the beginning 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.140
 a fragile note barely perceptible 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.560
 followed by another and other impossible 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.710
 ignore 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.140
 the choir grew until it became a 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.270
 pure living of sounds that echoed 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 in your mind until no other 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.090
 thought could survive while the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.729
 funeral dirge consumed him he opened his 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.970
 arms to the dead god and I accept his 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.100
 publication although its destruction was not 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.070
 what he had planned for him 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.619
 dead god asked for war in the womb 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.229
 from the great nothing a new purpose will 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.080
 was assigned to spread the funeral dirge 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.989
 throughout the earth and make the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.330
 dead will rise against the living 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.260
 was predestined to become a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.950
 dying herald of the dead god for 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.530
 rise and fall and rise again when 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.459
 your body will fail him to walk 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.790
 painfully through eternal death 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:38.670
 so that the funeral song never ceases and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.670
 that's how he was born and 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.290
 and
