00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.160
 what happened 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.310
 every time you participate in a 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 seminar of a lecture 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.840
 well aware of how much new information 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.150
 are important to your work 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 participate in meetings such as 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.190
 course on systems management 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.340
 harvesting and logistics that 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.110
 happened here in mato grosso do sul is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.360
 fundamentally a good professional should 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.220
 always be updated and in the sector 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.140
 is no different. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 therefore costs such as forestry 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.309
 carried out by the association 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.300
 agronomists field-grandense 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.120
 intend to offer good opportunities 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 for those who wish to specialize and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.470
 meet market demands 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.750
 The goal is really that it was in the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 together with the reforestation 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.880
 promote the qualification of our 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 technicians and professionals in the field is 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.260
 state of mato grosso do sul 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.510
 and then it was the success in fact we 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.690
 we have here people of several others 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.900
 States participating with us then coming 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.030
 really seeking this information is 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.260
 an area is actually expanding 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.670
 it was then we are enough to 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.100
 happy with the results we are 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.960
 achieving good professional 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 the task of those who believe that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.860
 information is the way to good 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.470
 forestry sector 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 What is missing is quite in the bush 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.790
 wholesale is still technical training 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.340
 because in practice what we have 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.380
 perceived is that there are still some 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.690
 information that is mismatched mato 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.180
 and this is extremely important. 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.640
 harmful to the planting of forests 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 because in fact the correction of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.820
 problems becomes very 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 difficult from next year ended 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.160
 the initial part what we come 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.210
 training with 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.920
 is wide 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.750
 the wide range of information in the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.930
 forest so the person can mansion 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 of the entire forest production chain 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.550
 from choice of species to management 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.410
 of the forest as a whole 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.990
 with the launching of the state plan of 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.090
 sustainable development of forests 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.590
 there are an estimated 200 thousand jobs 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660
 to the sector 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.070
 with this, the professional already thinks about 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.590
 prepare for the market 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.530
 the market requires professionals to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.670
 update right to be able to provide the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.500
 maximum profitability to whom it is paid 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.580
 for this service then the need 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.130
 qualification and the professional 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 he is charged more then he needs to 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.030
 to get acquainted with all matters to 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.300
 able to pass on information with 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.730
 credibility to the producer in the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.620
 field so competitive the professional 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.870
 should be concerned about the vacancies in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.820
 the labor market but there are still those who 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.060
 say that competition is a factor 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.160
 positive this competition I believe 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.460
 which is only positive because of the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.410
 qualification el come these 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.450
 the professionals here will have to 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.560
 qualify to be in the same position 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.350
 level and then it will only be this 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.970
 benefits to the entry of these 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.340
 our state and the countryside has 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.530
 much area for the performance of all of them 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.160
 whether environmental or forestry 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.970
 environmental engineers or engineers 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.000
 agronomists 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.660
 looks at the competition is always salutary her 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.740
 awakens some that perhaps 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 are drowsy in their profession or 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.900
 in your field of activity and the competition 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.460
 To me, it's always beneficial. 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.040
 What makes us offer our work 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.190

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.900
