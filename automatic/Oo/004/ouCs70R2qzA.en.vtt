probably<00:00:12.990> more<00:00:13.200> mid<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.710> guess<00:00:15.740> on<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.699> premise

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

this up you can see there's no flaking
not<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.530> lie<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> wax<00:00:37.920> does<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> little

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
not gonna lie the wax does get a little

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.500 
not gonna lie the wax does get a little
bit<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> head<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.940> not

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
bit on the head like but it's really not

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.360 
bit on the head like but it's really not
bad<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> wax

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
bad it just has a little bit of a wax

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
bad it just has a little bit of a wax
feel<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> sticky<00:00:46.980> wax

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
feel and it's not like a sticky wax

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
feel and it's not like a sticky wax
video<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.969> sometimes<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
video it's just like sometimes if you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
video it's just like sometimes if you
keep<00:00:49.230> rubbing<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> it'll<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
keep rubbing it it'll get on your

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.979 
keep rubbing it it'll get on your
fingers<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.660> bit<00:00:52.489> but<00:00:53.489> um<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.570> came

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
fingers a little bit but um it just came

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.150 
fingers a little bit but um it just came
out<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.350> sick<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> channel<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
out so sick look at the channel on that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.969 
out so sick look at the channel on that
it's<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.309> bright<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.910> can't<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> crims

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
it's so bright I can't the crims

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:16.999 
it's so bright I can't the crims
it<00:01:07.979> brightens<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:16.350> hardly<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it brightens it can hardly see the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.899 
it brightens it can hardly see the
mashed<00:01:17.280> potato<00:01:17.700> frame<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.650> makes<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> white

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.210 

it's<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.110> perfect<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.950> straight

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's just perfect it's got to straight

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's just perfect it's got to straight
and<00:01:29.630> afford<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.939> I'll<00:01:32.939> run<00:01:33.119> over

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and afford I'm in you and I'll run over

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
and afford I'm in you and I'll run over
the<00:01:33.450> pattern<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.920> 10<00:01:35.310> diamond

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the pattern for you so it's a 10 diamond

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
the pattern for you so it's a 10 diamond
top<00:01:36.420> string<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> such<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> wide<00:01:38.400> head<00:01:40.310> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
top string this is such a wide head you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
top string this is such a wide head you
did<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> came<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.560> happy

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
did that came out really nice I'm happy

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.719 
did that came out really nice I'm happy
with<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.810> don't<00:01:45.810> typically<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:47.130> when

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
with it don't typically do that but when

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.010 
with it don't typically do that but when
it<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.450> live<00:01:48.600> head

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it with a really live head

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
it with a really live head
I<00:01:49.049> consider<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.950> did<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.460> one

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
I consider it and I did it on this one

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.569 
I consider it and I did it on this one
that's<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> first<00:01:51.960> hole<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.399> did

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that's in the first hole and then I did

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
that's in the first hole and then I did
a<00:01:53.610> double<00:01:53.909> loop<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> keep<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:55.110> sure

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
a double loop just to keep make sure

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
a double loop just to keep make sure
that's<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.590> tight<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.939> skipped<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that's really tight then I skipped the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.920 
that's really tight then I skipped the
hole<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.979> did<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> loop<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.610> started<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.180> first

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
hole I did a loop and started this first

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.600 
hole I did a loop and started this first
sidewall<00:02:02.149> string<00:02:04.100> there's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> shooter<00:02:05.460> right

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
sidewall string there's a shooter right

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
sidewall string there's a shooter right
nearby<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.420> hard<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.840> but

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
nearby so it's kind of hard to see but

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
nearby so it's kind of hard to see but
skip<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.399> start<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> sidewall<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.209> do

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
skip and then start the sidewall and do

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.960 
skip and then start the sidewall and do
a<00:02:09.390> loop<00:02:09.720> there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
a loop there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.310 
a loop there
I'm<00:02:12.360> gonna<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.630> without<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.960> cheers<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:15.320> then

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
I'm gonna do without the cheers and then

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.670 
I'm gonna do without the cheers and then
after<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.570> skip<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.110> loop<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.530> did

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
after that skip and the loop I did

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.310 
after that skip and the loop I did
another<00:02:19.950> skip<00:02:21.110> skip<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> hole<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:23.760> there

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
another skip skip the hole right there

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.460 
another skip skip the hole right there
didn't<00:02:25.320> interlock<00:02:26.720> skip<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> hole<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.320> then

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
didn't interlock skip the hole and then

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.440 
didn't interlock skip the hole and then
I<00:02:28.500> did<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.420> single<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.720> over<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.200> span<00:02:31.530> of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
I did a single actually over the span of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.570 
I did a single actually over the span of
that<00:02:33.450> two<00:02:33.960> whole<00:02:34.320> thing<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.400> did<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that two whole thing so I just did a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.030 
that two whole thing so I just did a
really<00:02:36.570> wide<00:02:36.810> single<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.650> make<00:02:37.770> sure<00:02:37.890> it's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
really wide single to make sure it's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
really wide single to make sure it's
pulling<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.490> down<00:02:38.700> without<00:02:39.570> actually

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
pulling it down without actually

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.420 
pulling it down without actually
interlocking<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.860> pulled<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.160> top

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
interlocking that just pulled that top

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
interlocking that just pulled that top
to<00:02:41.520> channel<00:02:41.820> really<00:02:41.910> tight<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
to channel really tight there and then I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.810 
to channel really tight there and then I
did<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.960> ripple<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.920> got<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> triple<00:02:47.460> over<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
did a ripple you got a triple over the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.960 
did a ripple you got a triple over the
span<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> two<00:02:48.270> holes<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.710> did<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> skip<00:02:50.760> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
span of two holes so I did a skip and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
span of two holes so I did a skip and
then<00:02:51.060> three<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.970> did<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> double<00:02:54.980> over

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
then three and then I did a double over

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.410 
then three and then I did a double over
the<00:02:56.010> span<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.520> one<00:02:56.970> hole<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.680> just

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the span of just one hole so it was just

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
the span of just one hole so it was just
just<00:03:00.420> starting<00:03:00.720> from<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> top<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.710> I'll

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
just starting from the top or I'll

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.310 
just starting from the top or I'll
finish<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.120> off<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> single<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.140> then

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
finish it off and then a single and then

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.680 
finish it off and then a single and then
a<00:03:04.380> single<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.860> finish<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:06.120> starting<00:03:06.510> from<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690

because like when you're doing some
really<00:04:00.290> yep<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.590> have<00:04:01.680> all<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:01.950> tour<00:04:02.220> from

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
really yep you have all that tour from

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.330 
really yep you have all that tour from
the<00:04:02.610> from<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.410> chest<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.680> then<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.010> takes

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the from the chest and then it takes

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.640 
the from the chest and then it takes
it's<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:05.820> such<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> long<00:04:06.420> release<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.470> it

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
it's just such a long release that it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.710 
it's just such a long release that it
helps<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.160> little<00:04:08.220> width<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.540> it's

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
helps to have a little width so it's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.320
