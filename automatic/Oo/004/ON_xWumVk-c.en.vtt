 we go cord tendinous threads you are one and 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 associated with papillae by their muscles 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.420
 endless blood turbulent motion 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.570
 blood flow turns out to be the cause 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 the appearance of the fleshy trabeculae trabeculae 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.689
 Carnot and repeat the trabeculae of the carne 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.760
 gasoline chords repeat chlorine for this 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.059
 the length of his al bobiku aids fox

 butterfly valve in Lviv + pedals 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.700
 but we also see powerful muscles about 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.690
 left ventricle open the wall 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.289
 right ventricle right ventricle 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.989
 on the right is always the most so here 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 tricuspid valve struggle 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.480
 tricuspid look here sashes 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 they consist of endocardial duplicators 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.440
 arranged of course very difficult then 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.430
 tendon threads and 3 papillary muscles 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.330
 core data in vienna 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 and again we see fleshy trabeculae 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 trabeculae carnot and go back front 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.990
 surface of the heart and the level of the beginning 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.689
 aorta so now those who have come here 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.680
 chatting all went here come in two times 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.970
 three 4 5 I quickly parted 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.080
 put me 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.810
 I will even become someone 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.950
 miss four people here will become 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.960
 so i see you now we will check that 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 they know which vessel is fast 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.300
 call 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:52.000
 suggest and such a vessel oort what u 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.090
 Oort mouth is worth a close look at 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 exam too video toorta stands from 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.210
 bulbs round at this level a have mouth 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.970

 coronary artery 1 coronary artery 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.670
 went to what edge goes around some 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.680
 right some kind of artery true single 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.830
 or called latin rob and not 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.430

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.810
 The lymph nodes 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.360
 biological filters will be all 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.319
 ask by heart now take what 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.150
 artery 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.329
 start losing i go here well yes what 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.959
 the vessel was quickly called 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.959

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.370
 I now again ten times show 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.360
 all then just ask let's sound 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.940
 stand next and take as much 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.270
 us the desire to convey the forms of knowledge and these 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.880
 knowledge will then intensify in the clinic for those 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.000
 who wants to become a successful doctor gentlemen 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.520
 you must listen carefully

 carefully what happened to her she gave 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.890
 two branches what is this ramus and 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:35.290
 and walked with the hotel which anastomose 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.800
 arteries where the anastomosis occurs on 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.370
 the apex of the heart and the second artery goes around 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.290

 anastomose dextra crane outhouse 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.200
 it means two blood circulation 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.930
 formed on the heart 2 anastomosis one 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.620
 along the coronary sulcus and the other at the top 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.750
 hearts 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.990
 heart gets gorgeous 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.480
 blood supply magnificent venous here 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.340
 but the heart is a special organ dependent on 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.790
 our emotions as well and all 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.969
 diseases and now science has come to 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.489
 this many scientific articles 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.829
 which bind features 

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:24.809
 human disease with character 

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:26.909

 score so here we have learned the heart 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.499
 and you see that the frontal condition 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.709
 the plane can be practically divided 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.629
 heart on the front back front 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:18.119
 the department is just the ventricles and vessels 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:21.689
 which go out and the stomachs which vessels 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:24.409
 pulmonary and aorta where levichev begins 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.409
 quickly 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.850
 take away silent this unsuccessful enemies 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.120
 geography which is nothing new its 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.770
 lives so swapped to me 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.770
 Those who did not see quickly approached
