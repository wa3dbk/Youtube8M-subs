them then that gets boosted to twice as
strong<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.200> 100<00:01:43.560> power<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.460> better

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
strong so be 100 power so it's better

second move slot you have either toxic
or<00:01:48.990> willow<00:01:49.229> whisk<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.149> prefer<00:01:51.149> toxic<00:01:51.840> because

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
or willow whisk I prefer toxic because

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
or willow whisk I prefer toxic because
the<00:01:52.380> accuracy<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.040> better<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> plus<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the accuracy is better and plus that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.850 
the accuracy is better and plus that
damage<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.140> gets<00:01:55.380> built<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:55.920> time

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
damage also gets built up over time

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.470 
damage also gets built up over time
whereas<00:01:57.190> if<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.400> want<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.610> do<00:01:57.700> will<00:01:57.880> OS<00:01:58.150> that's

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
whereas if you want to do will OS that's

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.300 
whereas if you want to do will OS that's
cool<00:01:58.750> too<00:01:58.930> as<00:01:59.170> long<00:01:59.410> as<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.740> inflict<00:02:00.130> some

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
cool too as long as you inflict some

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
kind of status on them and then the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.770 
kind of status on them and then the
hacks<00:02:02.320> will<00:02:02.680> get<00:02:02.920> will<00:02:03.490> also<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.150> stronger<00:02:04.600> and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
then for the other two moves we have

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.990 
then for the other two moves we have
water<00:02:07.540> spouts<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:07.960> recover<00:02:08.500> water<00:02:09.340> spout<00:02:09.670> is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
water spouts and recover water spout is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.260 
water spouts and recover water spout is
an<00:02:10.179> awesomely<00:02:10.810> powerful<00:02:11.670> 150<00:02:12.670> power<00:02:12.910> water

an awesomely powerful 150 power water
attack<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.170> can<00:02:14.290> learn<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.190> want<00:02:15.460> to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
attack that it can learn so you want to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.790 
attack that it can learn so you want to
do<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.090> get<00:02:16.210> stronger<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.990> more<00:02:17.170> HP<00:02:17.410> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800
