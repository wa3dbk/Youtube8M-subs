00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800 
figured out here in a minute that
there's<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.580> easier<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there's an easier way to do this and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's an easier way to do this and

in a minute
I<00:02:28.410> believe<00:02:29.070> it's<00:02:29.220> actually<00:02:29.580> once<00:02:29.790> we<00:02:29.880> get<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I believe it's actually once we get to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.680 
I believe it's actually once we get to
the<00:02:30.510> actual<00:02:31.140> land<00:02:31.650> vehicles<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.270> might<00:02:33.570> be

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the actual land vehicles but it might be

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.850 
the actual land vehicles but it might be
right<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.490> depends<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.620> might

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
right now just all depends this might

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.020 
right now just all depends this might
have<00:02:37.980> been<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.400> when<00:02:38.520> he<00:02:38.610> was<00:02:38.760> telling

very last one but we made sure that we
didn't<00:03:08.910> use<00:03:09.030> any<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.510> these<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.350> can

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
didn't use any of these so that we can

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.870 
didn't use any of these so that we can
come<00:03:10.680> back<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.220> video<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.730> guys

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
so it made the most sense and it wasn't

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.580 
so it made the most sense and it wasn't
out<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.650> order<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.900> what<00:03:16.140> it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
out of order and you know what it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.170 
out of order and you know what it
actually<00:03:16.740> worked<00:03:17.070> out<00:03:17.250> sometimes<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.000> doesn't

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
actually worked out sometimes it doesn't

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.980 
actually worked out sometimes it doesn't
