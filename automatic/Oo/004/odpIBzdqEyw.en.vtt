00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
generations so that was probably one of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.140

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you can't like spam your jutsu and also

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.520 
you can't like spam your jutsu and also
your<00:01:34.520> your<00:01:35.520> chakra<00:01:36.119> takes<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.869> while<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
your your chakra takes a while to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
your your chakra takes a while to
recharge<00:01:38.040> after<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:39.750> think

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
recharge after that so i don't think

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
recharge after that so i don't think
it's<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.200> too<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.740> issue<00:01:40.939> i

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's going to be too much of an issue i

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's going to be too much of an issue i
think<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> demo<00:01:42.720> looks<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.259> cool<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
think the demo looks really cool I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
think the demo looks really cool I
honestly<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.689> storm<00:01:46.079> 3

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
honestly was not going to get storm 3
just<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.310> figured<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.060> I'll

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just because I figured I was like I'll

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
just because I figured I was like I'll
just<00:01:48.630> save<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:48.960> money<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.770> maybe

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310

get something else or something like

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.490 
get something else or something like
that<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.329> gotta<00:01:54.329> admit<00:01:54.750> storm<00:01:55.200> 3<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that but i gotta admit storm 3 is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.990 
that but i gotta admit storm 3 is
looking<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:55.979> nice<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.610> i'm<00:01:56.759> probably

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
looking pretty nice so i'm probably

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490 
looking pretty nice so i'm probably

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to get that on launch and probably

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
going to get that on launch and probably
going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> playthrough<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> story

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
going to do a playthrough of the story
