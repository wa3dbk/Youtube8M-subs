 registered in Ukraine and so 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.590

 stumbling block just said that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 you need a dazzle 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.020
 on the part of Ukraine, but we cannot 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.090
 take for what reasons that we do not 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.410
 We are citizens of Ukraine and transport

 the tool is registered Russian 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.160
 federations then there are two contradictions 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 which we can not deal with

 something is known in this situation 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.090
 advise and only here what something or 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 say within that framework the legislator 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.450
 which the studio started man that is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.370
