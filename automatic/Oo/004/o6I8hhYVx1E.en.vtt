00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.679 
thick I guess it's because it looks
photoshopped<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> mention

reason people are seeing is Vic is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
reason people are seeing is Vic is
because<00:01:38.939> they've<00:01:39.270> never<00:01:39.630> encountered<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
because they've never encountered this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.550 
because they've never encountered this
in-game<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.240> shadow<00:01:42.630> animatronics

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in-game but these shadow animatronics

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.670 
in-game but these shadow animatronics
appear<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.970> rare<00:01:45.240> occasions<00:01:46.110> I've

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
appear in really rare occasions I've

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.730 
appear in really rare occasions I've
spent<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> hours<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> game<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
spent a lot of hours on the game but I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.609 
spent a lot of hours on the game but I
still<00:01:50.189> haven't<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.909> saw<00:01:51.329> any<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.350> shallow

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
still haven't one saw any of the shallow

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.660 
still haven't one saw any of the shallow
and<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.070> Tronics

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and the Tronics

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
and the Tronics
I<00:01:53.729> believe<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.990> less<00:01:55.200> people<00:01:55.470> who<00:01:55.829> have

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I believe there are less people who have

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
I believe there are less people who have
played<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> Android<00:01:57.119> version<00:01:57.390> than<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> PC

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
played the Android version than the PC

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
played the Android version than the PC
version<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.250> even<00:01:59.579> though<00:01:59.729> most<00:01:59.909> people

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
version so even though most people
