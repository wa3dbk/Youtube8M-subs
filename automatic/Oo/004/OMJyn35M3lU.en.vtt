your own right so he's done a bunch of

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.970 
your own right so he's done a bunch of
times<00:02:17.780> already<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.620> yeah<00:02:18.830> this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
cliche that if you dry if you're driving

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.809 
cliche that if you dry if you're driving
you're<00:02:23.209> more<00:02:23.330> likely<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.660> die<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:24.530> you

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
you're more likely to die then if you

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.400 
you're more likely to die then if you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800

chance of dying on a run
thanks<00:02:34.400> guys<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:34.790> people<00:02:35.180> people<00:02:35.360> think

thanks guys I think people people think
about<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:35.750> right<00:02:36.110> especially<00:02:36.739> if<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:36.980> are

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
about that right especially if you are

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.800 
about that right especially if you are
someone<00:02:37.519> who<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.640> prone<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> seizures<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.510> lot

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
someone who is prone to seizures a lot

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.030 
someone who is prone to seizures a lot
of<00:02:38.900> people<00:02:39.110> with<00:02:39.230> seizures<00:02:39.560> either<00:02:39.800> don't

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
of people with seizures either don't

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.070 
of people with seizures either don't
drive<00:02:40.340> unless<00:02:40.370> they're<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.060> medication<00:02:41.780> or<00:02:41.959> if

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
drive unless they're on medication or if

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.930 
drive unless they're on medication or if
they<00:02:42.230> haven't<00:02:42.739> had<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> seizure<00:02:43.340> for<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.760> long

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
they haven't had a seizure for a long

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700 
they haven't had a seizure for a long
time<00:02:44.240> but<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.840> think<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:45.200> cool<00:02:45.440> that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
time but I think it's cool that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.010 
time but I think it's cool that
regardless<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.940> risks<00:02:47.390> which<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.840> guess

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
regardless of the risks which I guess

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.670 
regardless of the risks which I guess

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
whatsoever and so if I'm gonna put

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:08.949 
whatsoever and so if I'm gonna put
myself<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.389> harm's<00:03:08.599> way

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
myself in harm's way

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.349 
myself in harm's way
it's<00:03:09.349> got<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.799> real<00:03:10.219> good<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:11.000> has<00:03:11.150> to

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
it's got to be real good like it has to

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.640 
it's got to be real good like it has to
be<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.719> something<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.319> like

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
be for something that is like

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.550 
be for something that is like
irresistible<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.519> me<00:03:13.639> right<00:03:14.439> but<00:03:15.439> I<00:03:15.469> think

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
irresistible to me right but I think

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.140 
irresistible to me right but I think
skydiving<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.069> viscerally<00:03:16.549> scary<00:03:16.849> because

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
skydiving is viscerally scary because

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.110 
skydiving is viscerally scary because
it's<00:03:17.299> it's<00:03:17.629> it's<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.379> preys<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:18.799> all<00:03:19.120> natural

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
it's it's it's it preys on all natural

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.550 
it's it's it's it preys on all natural
it<00:03:20.420> goes<00:03:20.540> against<00:03:20.810> our<00:03:20.870> natural<00:03:21.230> survival

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it goes against our natural survival

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.809 
it goes against our natural survival
instincts<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:21.980> fall<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.189> the<00:03:22.280> ground<00:03:22.310> right

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
instincts to fall to the ground right

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.819 
instincts to fall to the ground right
put<00:03:23.090> yourself<00:03:23.389> you<00:03:23.989> know<00:03:24.049> in<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:24.530> situation

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
put yourself you know in that situation

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.710 
put yourself you know in that situation
whereas<00:03:25.819> if<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> horse<00:03:26.329> riding<00:03:26.540> or

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
whereas if you a horse riding or

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.000 
whereas if you a horse riding or
swimming<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.139> don't<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.470> think<00:03:27.680> well<00:03:27.859> yeah

it's fine but I mean if you if you had
the<00:03:30.260> seizure<00:03:30.409> while<00:03:30.620> swimming<00:03:31.090> probably<00:03:32.090> a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the seizure while swimming probably a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.300 
the seizure while swimming probably a
worse<00:03:32.329> situation<00:03:32.569> then<00:03:33.139> yeah<00:03:33.349> if<00:03:33.680> doing<00:03:34.099> that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
worse situation then yeah if doing that

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.770 
worse situation then yeah if doing that
because<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.519> is<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.849> guys<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.569> save

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
because this is the guys that can save

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.089 
because this is the guys that can save
them<00:03:35.870> whatever<00:03:36.019> yeah<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.439> a<00:03:36.500> good<00:03:36.620> point<00:03:36.829> I'm

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
still not convinced that's a good idea

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
things that I know are reasonably safe

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.599 
things that I know are reasonably safe
like<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.169> know<00:04:09.229> that<00:04:09.620> has<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:10.010> there<00:04:10.459> has<00:04:10.579> a

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
like I know that has that there has a

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.159 
like I know that has that there has a
very<00:04:10.879> small<00:04:11.419> chance<00:04:11.599> but<00:04:11.750> everything<00:04:12.079> went

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
very small chance but everything went

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.750 
very small chance but everything went
wrong<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.650> things<00:04:13.099> which<00:04:13.220> are<00:04:13.310> regulated

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
wrong and things which are regulated

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.339 
wrong and things which are regulated
like<00:04:13.849> if<00:04:13.939> it's<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.090> business<00:04:14.269> I'm<00:04:14.900> not<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.229> type

whatever the calculator making sure he's

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.129 
whatever the calculator making sure he's
fine<00:04:25.400> where<00:04:25.580> else<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.940> some<00:04:26.240> partying<00:04:26.630> yeah

and<00:04:27.289> make<00:04:27.409> sure<00:04:27.530> everything's<00:04:27.830> as<00:04:27.919> safe<00:04:28.070> as<00:04:28.190> it

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
and make sure everything's as safe as it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.680 
and make sure everything's as safe as it
could<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.639> before<00:04:28.789> I<00:04:28.940> did<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.389> probably

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
could be before I did it and I probably

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.839 
could be before I did it and I probably
be<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.840> first<00:04:30.050> person<00:04:30.289> either<00:04:30.560> but<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.610> think

that's my limit is doing something which
I<00:04:33.349> know<00:04:33.409> is<00:04:33.710> safe<00:04:33.919> rather<00:04:34.759> than<00:04:34.940> or<00:04:35.360> at<00:04:35.570> least

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750
