our artist Joe De Pere is going to show
us<00:00:08.880> how<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> sketch<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> female<00:00:10.110> body

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.920 

step<00:00:13.509> one<00:00:13.990> you<00:00:14.830> will<00:00:15.009> need<00:00:15.840> pencils<00:00:17.490> paper<00:00:18.490> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
step one you will need pencils paper and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.740 
step one you will need pencils paper and
a<00:00:19.930> ruler<00:00:21.150> step<00:00:22.150> 2<00:00:22.419> make<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.470> scale<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:25.630> we

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
a ruler step 2 make a scale when we

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.120 
a ruler step 2 make a scale when we
think<00:00:25.990> of<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.259> human<00:00:26.470> body

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
think of a human body

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.980 
think of a human body
we<00:00:27.460> generally<00:00:27.789> imagine<00:00:28.239> it<00:00:28.329> as<00:00:28.480> larger<00:00:28.960> than

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
we generally imagine it as larger than

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.589 
we generally imagine it as larger than
it<00:00:29.199> actually<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.670> if<00:00:30.849> you<00:00:30.880> divide<00:00:31.269> it<00:00:31.420> up

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
it actually is but if you divide it up

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.660 
it actually is but if you divide it up
you<00:00:32.349> will<00:00:32.500> actually<00:00:32.619> find<00:00:33.070> that<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.250> head<00:00:33.489> will

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
you will actually find that a head will

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.450 
you will actually find that a head will
fit<00:00:33.850> into<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.360> eight<00:00:34.540> times<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.949> first<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.370> all

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
fit into it eight times so first of all

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.939 
fit into it eight times so first of all
to<00:00:36.670> help<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:37.030> draw<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.360> body<00:00:37.600> draw<00:00:38.589> a<00:00:38.620> line

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.560 
to help you draw the body draw a line
down<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.250> left<00:00:39.580> hand<00:00:39.820> side<00:00:40.089> of<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.330> page<00:00:40.540> and

using a ruler if necessary you now have

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.640 
using a ruler if necessary you now have
eight<00:00:54.250> sections<00:00:54.879> on<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> page<00:00:55.420> if<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.260> look

at<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.860> finished<00:00:57.189> drawing<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:58.360> will<00:00:58.479> see

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
at the finished drawing you will see

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.570 
at the finished drawing you will see
that<00:00:58.960> each<00:00:59.140> guideline<00:00:59.500> correlates<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.489> a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
that each guideline correlates to a

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.660 
that each guideline correlates to a
different<00:01:01.089> part<00:01:01.299> of<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.570> body<00:01:02.129> step<00:01:03.129> four<00:01:03.430> the

different part of the body step four the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.380 
different part of the body step four the
head<00:01:04.650> heads<00:01:05.650> are<00:01:05.860> never<00:01:06.010> circular<00:01:06.610> they<00:01:07.270> are

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
head heads are never circular they are

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.890 
head heads are never circular they are
always<00:01:07.540> oval<00:01:08.110> shaped<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.979> an<00:01:09.130> egg<00:01:09.900> so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
always oval shaped like an egg so

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.359 
always oval shaped like an egg so
