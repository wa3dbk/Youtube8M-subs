00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.810
 Hi, I'm Antonio García from the star point 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.700
 is in today's video we're going to work 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.370
 with a picture of maría josé aparicio la 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.639
 I appreciate that has served 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.930
 because it has a series of circumstances 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.849
 very concrete that we are going to solve 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.320
 On the one hand we have a few 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.619
 tufts of hair part of hairs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 that escape that we want to eliminate and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.700
 we are going to eliminate them very easily with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.640
 two tools the clone buffer and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 the history brush 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 and we also have 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.410
 a small a small tuft here that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.060
 those who bother us in distracts or 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.750
 that rather lets us see the ear 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.160
 so here we have a problem of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 retouching that forces us to take a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.809
 decision we have two options keep 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 the ear and erase the lock or cover 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 the hair covering the covering of the ear 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.840
 second option is the simplest and it is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.280
 what we're going to do is what we're going to do 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 then let's go step by step doing 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.479
 these two of touches for this then good 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.180
 I think that in some other video I already 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.640
 I had commented we work with the tampon 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.370
 to clone over the image to remove 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.510
 this tuft cited that we fall here 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:29.350
 Normal fusion mode 40% opacity 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 and we can go very easily through 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.800
 the picture 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.770
 let's use the history brush 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.280
 so it is not necessary for us to be 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.460
 excessively neat 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 do not eliminate 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.909
 skin areas because we're going to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.999
 recover very easily later 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.819
 ok according to this area with this is 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.499
 enough and now we're going to use the 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.859
 history brush the history brush 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:03.409
 is a tool that returns us the 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.640
 image where we paint the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.289
 state of history that we 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 select by default comes 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.760
 selected the image as we opened it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 then try we can paint 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 we are recovering 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.580
 the parts of 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.170
 the chin that we had deleted from here 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.170
 we can simply continue 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.350
 to recover from those 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.660
 that we let ourselves that we uncover again 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 to some darker area more marked 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.940
 Cloner buffer 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.290
 a little thinner and we can already here 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 go over a lot more 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.730
 subtle and much more accurate 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.730
 what we have left 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.470
 this on the one hand let's do a before 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 after 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.890
 and now let's go to the part of the lock 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.239
 here as you see we could try to remove 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.099
 the lock of hair but we will have to 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.360
 invent parts of the ear and it's 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.030
 quite complicated there is one more solution 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.549
 effective that would be to catch strands of 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.549
 hair from this area here and 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.160
 clone them towards the ear we're going to catch 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.370
 the tie 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.720
 we select a lock 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.080
 large 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.200
 let's go let's try it here and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.630
 we use duplicate this selection in 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.510
 a new rat a control jack and with the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.840
 tool move this silicon or shortcut 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.360
 of keyboard uve move the layer 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.840
 as far as we want, I have caught 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.310
 a Cape 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.959
 so big notes that I have a huge 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.849
 so we can see how the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.400
 next lock because we are going to use 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.160
 at least one more the next 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.220
 mention will be more will be shorter then 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.530
 we can move it to where we see that 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.310
 you can melt it well we can use the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.420
 free transformation control t for 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.640
 move it 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.640
 and so also avoid a bit the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.930
 sensation of chlorinated lock around here more 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.930
 or less could we 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.920
 melt ok and now we apply the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.530
 layer mask 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.640
 and what we have to do is paint with 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.289
 a soft brush in black areas where 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.509
 let's see transitions 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.440
 and then you see that now that we're going 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:52.340
 painting 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.340
 let eliminating the borders so marked 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.460
 and our hair melts in a way 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.620
 much softer 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.870
 and it is much more integrated 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.870
 we can eliminate this area from here 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.889
 as you see 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.150
 we are adding hair 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:17.840
 but it is integrating quite well 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.449
 we can we can attach the image but 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.580
 we will select an area more hair 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.160
 in this case we will also add the 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.650
 hair that we have 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.650
 we have created us 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.490
 ce capital control to take everything 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.169
 that we have here the control view v not 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.139
 just have a new stage and with the 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:45.030
 move tool and here we are going to cover 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.810
 most of the 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.810
 let's find 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.919
 a union a fusion 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.919
 that can us 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.700
 integral 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.930
 here in maybe around here 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.180
 and is finding 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.810
 perfect this may not do the same 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.810
 layer mask 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.690
 Y 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.130
 we melted 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.290
 of steps backwards 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.620
 this better with a bigger brush and 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.100
 The bigger the brush is, you know 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.680
 the transition is smoother and the 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.210
 incorporates better integrates again what 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.980
 same as always has to be clean 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.580
 does not have to be perfect has to 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.300
 be clean and here then if we make 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.440
 again a before after this area 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.480
 we see what 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.480
 we have cleared a little 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:18.779
 the area of ​​the ear does not mark us so much 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:26.030
 and we also have the part of the lock 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.560
 of hair that showed us around here behind 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.889
 cleaner 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.040
 and nothing else this is all thank you very much and 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.040
 a greeting
