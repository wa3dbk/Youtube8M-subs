00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.960
 and with one more part and you know 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.939
 that we are still in the world 1 we no longer 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.140
 play the last four phases of the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.189
 I do not know that we do not get anything 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.099
 quickly and r-15 basically the tips 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.869
 they are the fat one like a house plus I put 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.029
 and what he was explaining to us is that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.070
 we can throw boxes to objects beyond 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.770
 from above a platform jumping a 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.649
 little bit and so on and there are some 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.719
 tell you about how long the video is going to 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.820
 be it is forgiveness that part to be very but 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.980
 that very short because it happens that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.230
 that we have to make the map of the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.060
 toys and the boss and within what 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.970
 It fits at least the first ones are very 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.650
 very very very fast and very simple 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.350
 so he asks us for a bit of 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.810
 patience you already know that I do it if 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.730
 I do one in a way the videos is by 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.590
 something and this is more than anything for 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.600
 prevent in the future because I already know what 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.570
 that will bring me in the future that is going 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.770
 to be much longer maps already 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 that I'm seeing right now in reality 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.600
 his short maps are short phases is a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.630
 passed unlike the others 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.680
 forward are very short and apart 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.090
 risks and so on as they are 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.160
 It is the first world expected that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.870
 it has to be rather the first world 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.900
 as a tutorial for a little more you can 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.180
 ask the mind we take the toy and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.710
 with this we complete the phase and 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.570
 surely we reach the record but 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.760
 let's go for sure 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 this is also a clear example this 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.720
 map of that making it fast and caught 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.640
 quickly the toy plus the gifts 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.290
 you can easily reach the record 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.790
 although there is a lot of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.740
 enemies by the way we can 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.740
 quickly kill and see 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 let's defend the queen first 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.479
 come to see the next 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.740
 it's been another thing I say it in advance 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.399
 pure another because it is I hope there is no 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:14.350
 human way of seeing almost the fist of gift 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.240
 that they go down very fast they continue to 16 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.130
 and in this phase you will see it is also very 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.720
 simple and good there the advice that we 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.790
 dan is that we put ourselves with the palms 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.500
 with mario 'on the floor and the objects that 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 they hit us on the top part, not us 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.270
 they hurt is more what repels moss and good 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 As you can see we do not climb on the palms 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.080
 to be able to jump much more you see the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.670
 block cited black below by 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.540
 basically there is the tip that they give us 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.660
 that with putting your hands on the ground and 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.580
 jumping pretty with the jump button 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.050
 we reach a greater height and good then 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.460
 it's easier when it comes to getting to 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.950
 sites 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.420
 I advise you completely that you take 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.790
 before the gift and now we go 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.460
 quietly to fight for the key 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.040
 golden 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.080
 the important thing that you do not forget to give 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.230
 to the button more than anything because it is that if 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.570
 the key with blocks will not be wrapped 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.650
 reds and you can access it and something 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.910
 bad is this that we're going to have to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.980
 lose here a little time but it's going 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.440
 nothing happens either, you see that it is very 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.910
 simple but we go more or less 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.740
 they choose a little the subject of 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.350
 colors and more 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.460
 here for example it is very simple but 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.160
 is that later on it is a 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.420
 barbarity is set as bad host 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.420
 I know it has to be said 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.290
 but it is more of the same if you are disgusted 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.120
 I already tell you in advance to see here what 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.710
 I do not want to eat salt, come out and this 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.380
 from the noses 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.780
 let's kill him with this one 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.000
 and you are going to take the gift there and well then 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.650
 this are extra points or we're going 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.150
 I think we're super lean but good 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.070
 it never hurts 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.780
 if you can kill the enemies of 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.210
 way because even though they look simple 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.460
 you can put it together and I've eaten 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.190
 silly ostias but when you say stupid 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.530
 fools because of trust you look like 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.120
 enemies that are in the plan of 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.970
 very simple but then you arm it is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.440
 what do you think? 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.440
 let's try one thing 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.700
 and we are not going to move anything 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.769
 this is this is amazing let's try 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.220
 one thing and we're not going to touch anything and just 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.020
 today bomb that breaks those that are a 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.200
 shit and let me the good and good the 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.940
 maps that are called m / m are maps of 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.770
 the toys that basically what 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 we have to do is escort everyone 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.390
 the toys that we have rescued in the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.950
 previous phases up to the box and once 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.080
 They are in the box because they are safe and 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.020
 we complete the map so each one 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.970
 of toys is paramount for the 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.420
 record so I shit on milk for 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.420
 this silly 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.390
 young is what happens by having the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.050
 fingers so huge fall up champion there 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.120
 we are why it is very important 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.550
 two keys of these maps catch all 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.050
 the letters and bring all the toys 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.610
 safe and sound you can see that the first 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.729
 map is 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.180
 it is very simple be simple not to be able 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.939
 more see now comes a very big snag 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.460
 to get the golden star in the 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:22.250
 map of the boss previously you have to 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.169
 take over the previous map and 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.330
 get to the boss's map and you do not get 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.390
 hit no blow let's say every life 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.820
 also part of the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:38.670
 in which I do not know the points basically 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.980
 more than if we repeat it is not to remove 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.600
 one life and those were about five thousand 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.760
 Oddly enough points Attach 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.560
 will take life and others and then over 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.830
 is that they are five thousand points and it is a 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.380
 Annoyance of no no you do not expect 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.570
 there is quickly we give you why this one 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.210
 get the golden star in the boss 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.550
 It's always going to be very difficult but good 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.920
 with patience we can not see that the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.640
 First, it is extremely simple 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.620
 guys is the simplest thing that 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.090
 destroyed in my life but of course then 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.340
 later on you will see that it will not be 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.200
 so simple and good apart from defeating 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.820
 to don that there are 5,000 points you see 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.310
 that all lives except the 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.490
 last that is another five thousand points and 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.730
 with the fifteen thousand plus the basics 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.380
 we come too close to the record I think 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.300
 Super Mario 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.460
 there we are 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.110
 cn surplus for fuck but plenty of 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.270
 and with these guys we have already 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.669
 completed the first world with all the 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.979
 stars all the gifts and all the 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.349
 toys so now we're going to the 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.349
 second world and here to start what 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.569
 well here the puzzle starts a little 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.190
 more elaborate enemies much more 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.259
 difficult , you will see everything 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.400
 continue to the following parts as well 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.169
 that nothing fourth that I hope that I have 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.729
 liked and if so, you know you will comment 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.699
 subscribe and those things all the more 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.000
 for following goodbye important to be 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.000
 happy
