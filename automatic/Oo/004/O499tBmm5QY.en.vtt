00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.940
 Argentinian and pause did Alba jumped 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.160
 the ball passed between the legs of the defender 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.880
 barcelona goalkeeper leopards pint not 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.350
 rescued 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.350
 as a result of 10 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 showed us several times repeating this 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 episode however spanish colleagues 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.509
 so they have a camera that is not clear 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.570
 honestly was the position of the game here 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.000
 here or out was from this point so 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.300
 like you look it seems that there was nâ€™t 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.379
 again, the camera needs to be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 another point of the field 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.970
 and then it was possible to judge that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.970
 great played be winter of course 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.610
 away the corner is this touch penta 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.530
 what a blow and barcelona compares the score 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.530
 bartra 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.110
 we drove above all and into the far nine 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.430
 despite all the problems the leopards squeezes 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.430
 maximum of standard 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 here you are and angles here are you and canopy but 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 the truth here is another completely veda 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.220
 moved the ball to the far corner of the axis of the faces not 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.060
 reach out 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 near the bar in the middle of the second half 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 eleven 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 here's the whole bale 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.180
 mail 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 bale mortra he put the case and all 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.310
 it was equal to him running near the gates of others 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.310
 gareth bale 21 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.239
 fantastically athlete gareth bale just 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.239
 fantastic 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.580
 that already just did not shoved 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.810
 threw out of the fields anyway was 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.300
 first I ran to the ball more 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.849
 there were attempts to quit today and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.940
 now realized you to the fullest 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.940
 the program 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.780
 look again at the whole attack 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.420
 everything seemed to end episode 6 as 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.420
 He was running 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 as if only rewind 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.360
 killed 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.360
 and he began to move faster than all 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.090
 and here is this desperation of bartr or anyone not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.090
 It was 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.460
 valar morghulis gate aerys 21 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.989
 real breaks ahead of course 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.989
