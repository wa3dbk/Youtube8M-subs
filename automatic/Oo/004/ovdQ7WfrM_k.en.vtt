station<00:00:38.370> um<00:00:38.579> what's<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.450> guess<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.020> will

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
station um what's your guess when will

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.869 
station um what's your guess when will
you<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:43.550> what<00:00:44.550> would<00:00:44.700> be

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you will be there I think what would be

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.500 
you will be there I think what would be
nice<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.750> Thursday<00:00:46.289> heating<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> guess

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
nice would be Thursday heating the guess

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.270 
nice would be Thursday heating the guess
is<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.530> hard<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> guess<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is it's a bit hard to guess at the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
is it's a bit hard to guess at the
moment<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:50.969> different<00:00:51.300> models

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
moment because there's different models

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.529 
moment because there's different models
and<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> weather<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.449> could

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and the weather and it could be it could

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.450 
and the weather and it could be it could
be<00:00:54.780> easily<00:00:55.079> add<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.559> difference<00:00:55.980> depending<00:00:56.129> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
be easily add a difference depending on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.670 
be easily add a difference depending on
what<00:00:56.610> model<00:00:57.000> comes<00:00:57.629> through<00:00:57.840> obviously<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
what model comes through obviously I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
what model comes through obviously I
would<00:00:58.859> hope<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.399> fast<00:00:59.670> race<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.690> then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
would hope for a fast race but then

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
would hope for a fast race but then
again<00:01:01.280> at<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> moment<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
again at the moment really can just

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.039 
again at the moment really can just
guess<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.680> sometime<00:01:05.189> between

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
guess something will be sometime between

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.710 
guess something will be sometime between
Thursday<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.080> Friday<00:01:08.119> all<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.299> thank<00:01:09.659> you
