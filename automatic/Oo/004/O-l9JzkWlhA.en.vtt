00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.320 
good question and I think that we are
seeing<00:03:15.540> sort<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.560> trend<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.760> minimalist

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
seeing sort of this trend of minimalist

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.500 
seeing sort of this trend of minimalist
design<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:19.260> interfaces<00:03:20.070> but<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.390> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
design in interfaces but I do think that

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.990 
design in interfaces but I do think that
the<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:21.860> let's<00:03:22.860> say<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.489> iphone

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the reason let's say the iphone

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.970 
the reason let's say the iphone
originally<00:03:24.690> had<00:03:24.930> all<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.320> these<00:03:25.530> sort<00:03:25.920> of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
originally had all of these sort of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.820 
originally had all of these sort of
skeuomorphic<00:03:26.820> designs<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.540> made<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.650> think

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
skeuomorphic designs that made you think

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.320 
skeuomorphic designs that made you think
you<00:03:29.010> were<00:03:29.130> using<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.820> an<00:03:29.940> office

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you were using you know an office

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.970 
you were using you know an office
desktop<00:03:30.780> calendar<00:03:31.230> or<00:03:31.530> anything<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:31.830> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
desktop calendar or anything like that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.790 
desktop calendar or anything like that
was<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.239> could<00:03:33.390> get<00:03:33.630> people<00:03:34.080> used<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
was so that we could get people used to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.130 
was so that we could get people used to
using<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.280> smartphone<00:03:35.700> or<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.060> touchscreen<00:03:36.540> so

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
using a smartphone or a touchscreen so

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.449 
using a smartphone or a touchscreen so
these<00:03:37.260> are<00:03:37.320> things<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.770> people<00:03:38.340> weren't

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
these are things that people weren't

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.340 
these are things that people weren't
really<00:03:38.760> used<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.360> beforehand<00:03:40.050> if<00:03:40.200> they

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
really used to beforehand if they

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.160 
really used to beforehand if they
weren't<00:03:40.560> mired<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.790> technology<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.750> now

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
weren't mired in technology so now

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.100 
weren't mired in technology so now
people<00:03:43.800> are<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.550> used<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:45.060> iPads<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:45.780> used<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
people are so used to iPads so used to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.140 
people are so used to iPads so used to
iphone<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.650> used<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:46.980> HTC<00:03:47.459> wants<00:03:47.730> Android

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
iphone so used to HTC wants Android

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.020 
iphone so used to HTC wants Android
Windows<00:03:48.450> Phone<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.290> three-year-old<00:03:50.070> babies

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
Windows Phone that three-year-old babies

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.780 
Windows Phone that three-year-old babies
are<00:03:51.330> using<00:03:51.720> iPads<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.040> easy<00:03:53.400> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
are using iPads so it's so easy and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.630 
are using iPads so it's so easy and
really<00:03:54.570> kind<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.290> our<00:03:55.440> collective<00:03:55.890> DNA<00:03:56.250> at

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
really kind of in our collective DNA at

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.340 
really kind of in our collective DNA at
this<00:03:56.820> point<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.510> most<00:03:57.810> part<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.290> think

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
this point for the most part I think

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.530 
this point for the most part I think
that<00:03:58.890> minimalist<00:03:59.610> design<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.390> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that minimalist design is really the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.240 
that minimalist design is really the
future<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.170> because<00:04:01.440> we<00:04:01.590> don't<00:04:01.860> have<00:04:02.070> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
future of it because we don't have to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
future of it because we don't have to
get<00:04:02.459> people<00:04:02.790> used<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.420> using<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.930> technology

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
get people used to using the technology

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.830 
get people used to using the technology
so<00:04:04.830> if<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.130> makes<00:04:05.370> any<00:04:05.459> sense<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:06.239> know<00:04:06.570> how

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
so if that makes any sense we know how

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.540 
so if that makes any sense we know how
to<00:04:06.900> use<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.230> touch<00:04:07.650> screen<00:04:07.800> we<00:04:08.070> know<00:04:08.220> how<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.489> use

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
to use a touch screen we know how to use

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.060 
to use a touch screen we know how to use
gestures<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.080> that<00:04:10.290> way<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.470> don't<00:04:10.800> think<00:04:10.980> it

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
gestures so in that way I don't think it

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.170 
gestures so in that way I don't think it
will<00:04:11.130> hinder<00:04:11.280> usability<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.060> actually

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
will hinder usability and I actually

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.900 
will hinder usability and I actually
think<00:04:12.480> it'll<00:04:12.690> open<00:04:12.810> some<00:04:13.140> doors<00:04:13.380> as<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.910> kind

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
think it'll open some doors as to kind

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.940 
think it'll open some doors as to kind
