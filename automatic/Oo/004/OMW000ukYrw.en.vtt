00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello guys the one you saw is the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 macadamia macadamia is a nut taken 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 from a tree from which an oil is extracted 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.619
 I speak to you today is this nut this 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 tree live in the south east of the Pacific 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.630
 macadamia belongs to the family 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.880
 protea c is only two species are 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 edibles are found in Australia and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.640
 are the macadamia intact leaf and the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.980
 macadamia de trafila because it is called 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 Macadamia nuts as a tribute to John 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 mcadam which is the first botanist he has 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.629
 described this plant from the thousand 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 virtue Macadamia nuts are toxic 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 for dogs they are used to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.760
 extract macadamia oil from 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 nascent griffonia this oil is can 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.649
 be used both for food and for use 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.690
 for cosmetic uses for food uses yes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 can be used especially for frying 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.850
 because it has resistance to the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.970
 very high temperature up to 200 degrees 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.220
 210 degrees plus or minus centigrade for which 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 this oil is also very well preserved 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.810
 open for two years 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.970
 naturally without heat sources 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 near and without light to a resistance 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.549
 excellent for heat and then used for use 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.340
 cosmetic for cosmetic use is used for 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.520
 mature dry skin irritated for 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.369
 prevent stretch marks and then how 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.619
 carrier for essential oils because 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.250
 it has a very very similar composition 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.490
 to human sebum and this makes it of a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.200
 power this makes it very penetrating 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.620
 with a penetrating power in the skin 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.410
 very high so it is widely used 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.370
 for cosmetic use both for the skin and 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.220
 for the hair 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.340
 the hair in fact if you make a compress with 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.600
 macadamia oil remains shiny 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.150
 soft and really much if you drown yours 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.030
 composition is made 60 percent of 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.920
 oleic acid and at 19 percent from 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.440
 Palmitoleic acid and is the concentrate 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.110
 highest in nature of this acid has the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 typical characteristics of very oils 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.290
 rich in triglycerides 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.959
 what is the macadamia oil I use myself 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.560
 I use this macadamia oil which is that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.200
 akamuti you see are almost in the middle is a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.340
 really fantastic oil that has a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.000
 incredible absorbing power for 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.190
 which I use as a hair pack but 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.489
 especially in the evening on the face like 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.049
 make-up remover is enough to moisten the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.150
 facial skin with some water 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.250
 spa or simply with a peer 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 tap water and then take a 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:05.110
 cotton pad and do two or three 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.670
 zhik of macadamia oil and then pass it 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.760
 for example on the eyes or on the contour 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 eyes the extraordinary absorbing power 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.329
 of the makeup that bought mixed oil has a 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.610
 the delicious smell of roasted peanuts 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.519
 make the makeup remover better than me 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.470
 have i ever tried i tried several at 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.030
 coconut I do not even make-up with 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.400
 the oil 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.640
 vat goes well any oil for 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.050
 take off but with this it really is a 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.350
 task easier and faster between 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.330
 the other has an emollient property yes 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.550
 immediately melts a little with the skin 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.220
 sweet the smooth and also goes very well 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.489
 later when you finish untangling yourself 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.440
 for example for the eye contour 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.250
 I really tried to find a side 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.010
 negative of this oil that is absorbed 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.620
 so easily and that it lifts the makeup 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 so good without creating create that 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.810
 annoying patina of opacity that a 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.700
 sometimes it is in front of the eyes after 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.140
 who lived rigged precisely with the oil of 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.410
 coconut with others 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.200
 anyway, this oil is not a nuisance 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.160
 check because it is so high 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.970
 the absorbing power that really the 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.870
 moment of removing make-up becomes a pleasure 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.780
 also because the smell so much 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.150
 inviting that really the time to 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.060
 make-up becomes becomes just one 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 joy so I had never found 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.110
 macadamia oil I was very curious 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.540
 because I knew it was a light oil 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.910
 for mature skin but that was fine 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.510
 even for mixed skin it is 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.330
 confirmed and always have been 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.430
 cute trees coming 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.410
 from Australia so I also had a lot 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.450
 curiosity to try this oil that you don't 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.570
 it is expensive but the same characteristics 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.700
 of oils much much more expensive indeed 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.820
 perhaps best features for 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.740
 example of argan oil then lo 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.650
 I recommend a lot but I recommend it 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.370
 very much especially for those who do 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.310
 often removes thick or all 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.250
 then of course to take it away 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.980
 layer of oil and makeup that has absorbed 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.660
 all the makeup I use my soap 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.810
 African black that forms that foam 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.690
 creamy so I then take away the oil from 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.320
 macadamia and I'm ready to spray a 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.080
 idol side is simply so go 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.570
 to sleep with bare skin because in fact a 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.669
 at night the skin regenerates ee 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.070
 so then you wake up the next morning 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.910
 to be removed with macadamia oil 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.190
 and black soap with really leather 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.970
 fantastic this is my routine and to 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.430
 the make up 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.530
 if you want to write under the video 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.590
 your make up routine 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.419
 or the oils you tried bye 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.419
 see you at the next video
