as<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.610> said<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> pure

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
as I said this is going to be the pure

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.359 
as I said this is going to be the pure
rushing<00:01:35.790> class<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.380> first<00:01:37.650> part<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
rushing class so our first part is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.539 
rushing class so our first part is
lightweight<00:01:39.380> helping<00:01:40.380> us<00:01:40.500> move<00:01:40.740> faster<00:01:41.369> we

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
lightweight helping us move faster we

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
lightweight helping us move faster we
can<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.850> into<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> enemy<00:01:42.540> spawn<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.229> kill

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
can get into the enemy spawn and kill

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
can get into the enemy spawn and kill
them<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.189> quicker<00:01:44.520> than<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.299> able

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
them much quicker than we would be able

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
them much quicker than we would be able
to<00:01:45.600> without<00:01:46.110> lightweight<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.610> our

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to without lightweight then for our

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.050 
to without lightweight then for our
second<00:01:48.240> park<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> scavenger<00:01:50.280> scavenger

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
second park we have scavenger scavenger

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.510 
second park we have scavenger scavenger
is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> great<00:01:51.840> part<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.530> class<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.040> we

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is a great part for this class as we

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.550 
is a great part for this class as we
will<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:54.450> will<00:01:54.570> never<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> worry<00:01:55.409> about

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
will we will never have to worry about

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800 
will we will never have to worry about
our<00:01:55.860> ammo<00:01:56.299> especially<00:01:57.299> since<00:01:57.570> we'll<00:01:57.780> be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
our ammo especially since we'll be

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
our ammo especially since we'll be
gunning<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> enemy<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.219> running

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
straight over their body to get where we

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.609 
straight over their body to get where we
need<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:03.329> third<00:02:03.689> perks<00:02:04.110> we

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
need to be and for our third perks we
