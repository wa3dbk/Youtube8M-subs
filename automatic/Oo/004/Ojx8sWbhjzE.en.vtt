00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:17.210
 Thank you. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.689
 Hello . This is three or four. Today. 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.520
 When I was dating before today 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:44.090
 I prepared the pattern make-up. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.500
 I have a boyfriend, a little boy, a little bit younger, Jonathan's saving a little difference 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.970
 It's me. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:58.910
 So when I go out on a date, I do not have a lot of makeup. 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.629
 I mean, we burned more when we burned . 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:09.050
 Well not just be a bit casual makeup danineunge 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:11.660
 I gathered when I was there, but it was the smallest because I had a picture. 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.610
 It's a commemoration. 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:21.610
 It's a bit different from usual, but it's special . 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 Oh, so what kind of makeup do you want? 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.080
 Not too heavy, but a little 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.720
 I wonder if there is a sporty Decake makeup 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:42.520
 I've done make-up myself. 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 Uh yellow color is not going to use the red color I see coming 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.040
 Which yellow and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 I used the same pitch color in two VIPS. 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.189
 I think I'm putting yellow on the overall lover bass color.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:10.109
 I have a cream blusher out of a little methane gas pitch 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.099

 In the morning, with makeup, I had to fix it in the evening, so the skin was a concealer. 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 I'll use only a little bit of the cleared part. 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:03.900
 You can look at your eyebrows with your eyebrows. 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.680
 Instead, I heard it more widely. 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:14.480

 Because the autonomous load can be seen, only the double color line of wood color 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.459
 I'm going to paint the shadows. 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.459
 Instead, this is not a problem . I'd like you to use a matte crutches shadow.
