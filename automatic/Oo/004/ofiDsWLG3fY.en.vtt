 kennedy 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.280
 is planning to turn in this program yes sir 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.380
 there's nothing you can not do for this 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.920
 country you have everything you need to 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.920
 to get it 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.170
 as they are prepared will have 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.190
 He healed very well what he thinks of what

 Jason Bourne was the tip of the iceberg 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.309
 and sharon cross 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.020
 we had never seen results like 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.380
 these 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.750
 ton stress without imperfections there was no 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.460
 known to anyone from the program and how many 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 we are 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.750
 you ask too many questions 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 confirmed and said that it should be hung 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.150
 well listening is an emergency of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.550
 national security the fbi is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 investigating connections between Trenton and 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.969
 this man Jason Bourne 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.189
 I will fall because of this you 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.270
 They gave away a Ferrari and your people treated it 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.270
 as if it were a tractor 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 you are asking me to address the map to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.980
 our most valuable agents 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 let's start to consider the magnitude of 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.430
 what falls on us if this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.430
 splashes what do you mean 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.530
 let's reduce the program to ashes 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530
 yes 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.550

 I want to live, you thought everything was over 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.390
 with borg here many more things happen 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.990
 they modified two different chromosomes is 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.160
 the most spectacular advance of science 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.160
 I'm not just a scientific project 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.240
 I gave it all for them and anybody 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.450
