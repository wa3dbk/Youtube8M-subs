00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 of how to play dead island but low 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 the minimum requirements I can play to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.960
 dead island with normal requirements 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.960
 but many people want to play it and not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
 can for the performance of your pc like this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.440
 here is a tutorial on how to play it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.020
 without the minimum requirements 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.500
 obviously close to him do not expect that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.360
 a PC of less than 256 mb of video a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 fairly decent processor or 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 empowered them to run here goes the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 good tutorial the first thing we have 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 what to do is go to the folder where we have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 installed the game in my case I'm going to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.540
 team then to local disk then to the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.340
 dead island folder the second already inside 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.800
 from the dead install folder 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.300
 island there are two options the first is to go 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 to the folder called out 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 and they enter you there if they do not find a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.649
 file called video is because it is not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.080
 there the second option is to go back and go 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.150
 of the folder and enter there then 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.460
 we headed out 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 we enter you and we will get audio and video 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 in some case if they have windows 7 they do not 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.730
 will allow opening the file what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.160
 we will make it in that folder to create a 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.290
 text document after this 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.210
 we support the file that we will occupy 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.160
 which will be the video by any type 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.260
 of inconvenience ready that now 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.810
 we drag the folder called video the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.630
 original not supported we drag 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.640
 to the text document then it will come out 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 this now has already opened this what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.870
 we will review and we will realize that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.119
 is how to edit the resolution of 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.090
 graphic potential of the game do not 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.160
 nothing yet now after revised 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 we will edit the following points of this 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.780
 folder that I will show you on the screen 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.140
 with the designated values ​​on the screen 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 we will copy them exactly the same then 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 they keep it with what they edited they go back to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 check it to see if it was saved if you did not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.150
 kept make another with the values 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.369
 indicated on the screen and replace it 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 by the original already done that they close and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.630
 they go to the game if you do not run them yet it's 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.610
 because the pc is not able to run it with 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 no possibility or if it does not follow 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.020
 trying to lower more and more those 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.660
 levels without my responsibility 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 remember to always back the files 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.010
 that edit do not change so as not to commit 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 errors do not edit in the values ​​within 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.880
 of the game because it will cancel what they have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 edited in the folder that we use called 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.830
