00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.899
 so hello to everyone and immediately want to say 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.599
 what is the first video we have and such a plan 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.610
 the new ones probably understood it this way 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 I promised my public VKontakte long ago 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 us to do something like that now 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.510
 finally decided and recorded because u 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 I have no time there parents in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 next few minutes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 it will go to the guitar playing or rather 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 about the basics of playing the guitar 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 with this video i want to push you to start 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.949
 play this musical instrument and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.469
 tell you more precisely tell what's in it 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.630
 There is nothing terrible or difficult many 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030
 people want to learn how to play the guitar but 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 do not want to start doing it because 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 they think that they will not turn out well 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 go to some classes section with them 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 just not possible knees such 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 people are greatly mistaken since I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 for example, learned to play without any 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 using of course my level of play on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 guitar 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 I am a master pro but I am pleased with him and he 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.949
 no longer needed in the basics of playing the guitar 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 nothing is heavy and as soon as you 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.439
 You will be able to teach them immediately. 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.049
 decide whether you need to continue or 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.330
 stay at this level so 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.990
 the first thing to start is to take in 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.479
 hands guitar 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860
 well done the floor and now I 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.320
 show you the most basic chords 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.000
 which occur most often and which 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.000
 you need a hundred pounds to know about 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.870
 so if you give the day at least 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.970
 half an hour to honing these chords 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.100
 on the transition from one chord to another 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.510
 soon you will be able to play tunes when 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.340
 acting out these chords they 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.980
 fundamentally the main thing here is filled with rub a 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.630
 then pick a fight on it all 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.550
 I hope this video a little you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.440
 helped and prompted to 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.540
 learn to play the guitar or at least 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.710
 just start somehow che quit skills and 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 radio skill over time 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.710
