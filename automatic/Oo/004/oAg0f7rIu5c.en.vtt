00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.300 
Sun and Moon travel within the firmament
it's<00:03:46.120> where<00:03:46.420> God<00:03:46.450> lives<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.290> birds<00:03:47.950> travel

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310

and<00:03:55.060> night<00:03:55.269> were<00:03:55.480> created<00:03:55.930> before<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.319> Sun

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
and night were created before the Sun

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
and Moon and the moon was a light just

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.349
