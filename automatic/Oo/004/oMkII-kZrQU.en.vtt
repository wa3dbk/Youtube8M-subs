introduction<00:00:12.209> video<00:00:12.980> I've<00:00:13.980> talked

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
introduction video I've talked

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.060 
introduction video I've talked
whenever<00:00:15.700> you<00:00:15.970> do<00:00:16.180> those<00:00:16.810> movements<00:00:17.500> you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
whenever you do those movements you

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.290 
whenever you do those movements you
should<00:00:18.250> always<00:00:19.470> visualize<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.740> joint<00:00:21.300> opened

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
should always visualize the joint opened

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.720 
should always visualize the joint opened
and<00:00:22.660> also<00:00:23.260> fill<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.619> joints<00:00:23.950> with<00:00:24.130> it<00:00:24.250> opened

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
and also fill the joints with it opened

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.960 
and also fill the joints with it opened
and<00:00:25.050> extend<00:00:26.050> in<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.560> directions<00:00:27.220> that<00:00:27.610> you're

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
and extend in a directions that you're

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.210 
and extend in a directions that you're
moving<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.630> words<00:00:28.869> for<00:00:29.680> example<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.099> this

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
moving to words for example in this

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.260 
moving to words for example in this
movements<00:00:31.320> disappear<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.440> joints<00:00:33.030> open<00:00:34.030> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
movements disappear the joints open and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.200 
movements disappear the joints open and
extend<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.770> this<00:00:36.010> direction<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:37.110> said<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.910> you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
extend in this direction I said when you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.490 
extend in this direction I said when you
do<00:00:41.020> all<00:00:41.260> those<00:00:41.559> movements<00:00:41.949> this<00:00:42.850> way

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
do all those movements this way

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.259 
do all those movements this way
eventually<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:45.129> will<00:00:45.370> develop<00:00:45.760> some

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
eventually you will develop some

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.280 
eventually you will develop some
internal<00:00:46.870> power<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:49.030> this<00:00:49.270> video<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:50.230> would

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
internal power and in this video I would

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.180 
internal power and in this video I would
like<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:51.540> show<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.809> simple<00:00:53.230> way<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.649> test

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
like to show you a simple way to test

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.299 
like to show you a simple way to test
whether<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.360> have<00:00:55.510> developed<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.320> internal

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
whether you have developed this internal

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.420 
whether you have developed this internal
power<00:00:57.489> or<00:00:57.969> not<00:00:58.270> okay<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.260> for<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.829> test<00:01:00.070> you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
power or not okay so for the test you

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.299 
power or not okay so for the test you
would<00:01:00.969> need<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.239> partner<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:02.050> help<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.100> what

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
would need a partner to help you so what

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.660 
would need a partner to help you so what
you<00:01:03.340> do<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.760> first<00:01:03.969> you<00:01:04.210> extend<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.930> arms

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you do is first you extend your arms

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.359 
you do is first you extend your arms
okay<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:08.200> partner<00:01:08.560> will<00:01:08.740> try<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:08.979> bend

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
okay and your partner will try to bend

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.570 
okay and your partner will try to bend
your<00:01:09.970> arm<00:01:10.240> from<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.570> elbow<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.860> try<00:01:12.280> your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
your arm from the elbow so you try your

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.490 
your arm from the elbow so you try your
best<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:13.000> resist<00:01:13.539> ok<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:15.070> extend<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.210> arm<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
best to resist ok so extend the arm and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.999 
best to resist ok so extend the arm and
I'll<00:01:18.340> try<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.580> bend<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.899> from<00:01:20.289> Pena<00:01:20.740> bomb

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
I'll try to bend and you from Pena bomb

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.529 
I'll try to bend and you from Pena bomb
from<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.250> parallel<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.940> then<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.330> try<00:01:22.509> to

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
from the parallel and then you try to

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.320 
from the parallel and then you try to
resist<00:01:25.319> okay<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:26.380> I'm<00:01:26.800> stronger<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:27.850> easy

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
resist okay so I'm stronger so it's easy

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.859 
resist okay so I'm stronger so it's easy
for<00:01:28.509> me<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.690> pan<00:01:29.110> up<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.599> next

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
for me to pan up so and then the next

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.020 
for me to pan up so and then the next
time<00:01:33.179> when<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:34.330> do<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.340> keep<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.729> silk

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
time when you do this you keep the silk

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.210 
time when you do this you keep the silk
willing<00:01:37.509> exercise<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.319> way<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.590> do<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.979> in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
willing exercise the way you do it in

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.130 
willing exercise the way you do it in
mind<00:01:39.459> so<00:01:39.849> when<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.179> extend<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.720> arms

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
mind so when you extend your arms

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.580 
mind so when you extend your arms
visualize<00:01:42.130> all<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.729> joints<00:01:43.030> open<00:01:43.840> open<00:01:44.440> open

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
visualize all the joints open open open

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.580 
visualize all the joints open open open
and<00:01:45.009> then<00:01:45.130> your<00:01:45.280> arms<00:01:45.520> extend<00:01:46.179> we<00:01:47.050> saw<00:01:47.229> us<00:01:47.410> and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
and then your arms extend we saw us and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.070 
and then your arms extend we saw us and
-<00:01:47.740> your<00:01:47.890> arms<00:01:48.250> extend<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.360> weather<00:01:49.599> father

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
- your arms extend to the weather father

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.089 
- your arms extend to the weather father
of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:52.000> groom<00:01:52.270> ok<00:01:53.819> so<00:01:54.819> this<00:01:55.599> time<00:01:55.869> when<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:56.979> do

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
of the groom ok so this time when you do

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.510 
of the groom ok so this time when you do
this<00:01:57.750> visualize<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.959> joints<00:01:59.349> open<00:01:59.830> open<00:02:00.310> and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
this visualize the joints open open and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.460 
this visualize the joints open open and
then<00:02:00.640> your<00:02:00.759> palms<00:02:01.000> extend<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.200> wedding

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
then your palms extend to the wedding

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.500 
then your palms extend to the wedding
file<00:02:02.709> and<00:02:03.539> try<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:04.569> bend<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.289> elbow

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.199 

it<00:02:11.510> becomes<00:02:11.810> much<00:02:12.200> harder<00:02:12.590> okay<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
it becomes much harder okay so this is

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.320 
it becomes much harder okay so this is
the<00:02:14.390> internal<00:02:14.840> power<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.950> talked<00:02:16.220> about

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the internal power that I talked about

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.289 
the internal power that I talked about
just<00:02:17.330> whenever<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.260> do<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:18.530> visualize<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
just whenever you do this visualize the

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.020 
just whenever you do this visualize the
joints<00:02:20.810> open<00:02:21.650> open<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.519> then<00:02:22.640> your<00:02:22.819> arms

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
joints open open and then your arms

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.410 
joints open open and then your arms
extend<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.110> when<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.769> do<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.129> also<00:02:25.879> keep

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
extend and when you do this also keep

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.949 
extend and when you do this also keep
your<00:02:26.569> arms<00:02:26.959> relaxed<00:02:27.709> okay<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:29.060> use<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
your arms relaxed okay don't use the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.839 
your arms relaxed okay don't use the
muscle<00:02:30.319> gonna<00:02:30.470> fall<00:02:30.709> okay<00:02:31.129> keep<00:02:31.370> your<00:02:31.400> arms

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
muscle gonna fall okay keep your arms

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.750 
muscle gonna fall okay keep your arms
relaxed<00:02:32.750> just<00:02:33.049> feel<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.410> joints<00:02:33.860> open<00:02:34.549> and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
relaxed just feel the joints open and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:45.610 
relaxed just feel the joints open and
then<00:02:34.970> your<00:02:35.120> arms<00:02:35.330> extend
