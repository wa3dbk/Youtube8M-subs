here cheer for her for her for her most

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.719 
here cheer for her for her for her most
likely<00:06:06.180> for<00:06:07.180> her<00:06:07.659> sees<00:06:08.229> this<00:06:08.379> like<00:06:08.439> spells<00:06:09.219> and

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
likely for her sees this like spells and

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.589 
likely for her sees this like spells and
counters<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:12.460> I<00:06:12.550> think<00:06:12.699> these<00:06:12.819> are<00:06:12.879> the<00:06:13.030> costs

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
counters and I think these are the costs

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.219 
counters and I think these are the costs
or<00:06:13.870> levels<00:06:14.319> you<00:06:14.800> only<00:06:15.009> play<00:06:15.279> these<00:06:15.490> when

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
or levels you only play these when

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.749 
or levels you only play these when
because<00:06:17.229> these<00:06:17.529> are<00:06:17.889> a<00:06:17.919> particular<00:06:18.430> level<00:06:18.580> to

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
because these are a particular level to

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:24.029 
because these are a particular level to
play<00:06:18.939> them<00:06:20.129> so<00:06:21.129> that's<00:06:21.219> pretty<00:06:21.490> cool<00:06:22.979> how<00:06:23.979> the

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
play them so that's pretty cool how the

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:32.249 
play them so that's pretty cool how the
whole<00:06:24.189> back<00:06:24.400> was<00:06:24.550> English<00:06:24.909> to<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.930> see<00:06:32.080> that

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
whole back was English to you see that

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.659 
whole back was English to you see that
you<00:06:32.469> pause<00:06:32.889> the<00:06:32.919> screen<00:06:33.099> here<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:33.460> read<00:06:33.550> that

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
you pause the screen here and read that

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.029 
you pause the screen here and read that
so<00:06:34.509> this<00:06:34.750> is<00:06:34.779> we<00:06:34.990> cross<00:06:35.259> I'm<00:06:35.469> probably<00:06:35.680> of

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
so this is we cross I'm probably of

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.010 
so this is we cross I'm probably of
