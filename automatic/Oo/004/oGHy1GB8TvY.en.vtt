00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
think

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.730 
think
the<00:02:47.970> first<00:02:48.209> time<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.569> drove<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.319> came<00:02:49.530> in

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
the first time I drove it when I came in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.830 
the first time I drove it when I came in
the<00:02:49.830> booth<00:02:49.980> felt<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.240> one<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.540> spend

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the booth felt like it was one to spend

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.570 
the booth felt like it was one to spend
and<00:02:52.349> second<00:02:52.800> year

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
and second year

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.890 
and second year
war<00:02:54.880> planning<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.690> rolled<00:02:55.930> into<00:02:56.140> it

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
war planning I kind of rolled into it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.810 
war planning I kind of rolled into it
did<00:02:58.900> feel<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.590> mean<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.040> track<00:03:00.370> or<00:03:00.640> anything

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
did feel I mean it in track or anything

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.910 
did feel I mean it in track or anything
in<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.330> would<00:03:01.690> straight<00:03:02.050> could<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.830> of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
in this would straight could be of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.450 
in this would straight could be of
course<00:03:02.950> constants<00:03:04.080> 85<00:03:05.080> degrees<00:03:05.470> yeah<00:03:05.890> right

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
course constants 85 degrees yeah right

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.970 
course constants 85 degrees yeah right
now<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.640> don't<00:03:07.030> know<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.990> does<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.530> heat<00:03:08.740> and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
now I don't know this does the heat and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.440 
now I don't know this does the heat and
the<00:03:09.130> temperature<00:03:09.310> affect<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.970> way<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.210> car

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the temperature affect the way this car

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.920 
the temperature affect the way this car
runs<00:03:10.690> yeah<00:03:11.110> oh<00:03:11.370> yeah<00:03:12.400> at<00:03:12.550> night<00:03:12.730> intake<00:03:13.630> temps

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
runs yeah oh yeah at night intake temps

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.540 
runs yeah oh yeah at night intake temps
to<00:03:14.020> drop<00:03:14.140> about<00:03:14.380> forty<00:03:14.800> fifty<00:03:15.070> degrees<00:03:15.340> which

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
to drop about forty fifty degrees which

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.220 
to drop about forty fifty degrees which
is<00:03:15.610> about<00:03:15.820> thirty<00:03:16.210> five<00:03:16.390> horsepower<00:03:16.750> forty

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
is about thirty five horsepower forty

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.290 
is about thirty five horsepower forty
horsepower<00:03:17.550> sorry<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.640> think<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.140> significant

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
horsepower sorry I think it significant

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.720 
horsepower sorry I think it significant
not<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.750> much<00:03:20.930> like<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.140> he<00:03:21.980> had<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.550> much

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
not so much like a he had that so much

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.640 
not so much like a he had that so much
one<00:03:22.940> actually<00:03:23.720> has<00:03:23.870> credit<00:03:24.140> cards<00:03:24.410> what<00:03:24.530> you

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
one actually has credit cards what you

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.020 
one actually has credit cards what you
have

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
have

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.210 
have
not<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:27.050> I<00:03:27.200> don't<00:03:27.320> really<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:27.860> as<00:03:28.070> much

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
not really I don't really see it as much

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.830 
not really I don't really see it as much
maybe<00:03:28.550> in<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.790> biana<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> have<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.720> know

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
maybe in that biana that I have you know

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.230 
maybe in that biana that I have you know
a<00:03:29.870> little<00:03:30.140> bit<00:03:30.260> you'll<00:03:30.710> tell<00:03:30.980> but<00:03:31.370> yeah<00:03:31.760> for

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
a little bit you'll tell but yeah for

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.840 
a little bit you'll tell but yeah for
the<00:03:32.360> most<00:03:32.570> part<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.370> same<00:03:34.580> it's

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
the most part it's not the same it's

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.010 
the most part it's not the same it's
slow<00:03:35.320> it's<00:03:36.320> hot<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:36.680> lower<00:03:36.920> right<00:03:40.810> yeah<00:03:41.810> this

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
slow it's hot it's lower right yeah this

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.390 
slow it's hot it's lower right yeah this
thing's<00:03:42.260> pretty<00:03:42.470> awesome<00:03:42.620> I'm<00:03:43.070> gonna<00:03:43.130> try

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
thing's pretty awesome I'm gonna try

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920 
thing's pretty awesome I'm gonna try
that<00:03:43.580> again<00:03:43.640> I'm<00:03:44.120> gonna<00:03:44.240> do<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> third<00:03:44.690> gear

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
that again I'm gonna do a third gear

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.980 
that again I'm gonna do a third gear
here<00:03:45.230> now

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
here now

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.990 
here now
and<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> third<00:03:46.860> year<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.340> roll<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.880> at

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
and it's the third year just roll in at

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:05.610 
and it's the third year just roll in at
60<00:03:48.390> miles<00:03:48.570> an<00:03:48.780> hour

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:17.229 

so<00:04:05.800> it's<00:04:06.069> all<00:04:06.160> factory<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:06.910> all<00:04:07.030> fact

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.230 

yep<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.479> factory<00:04:20.840> suspension<00:04:21.019> is<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:22.069> mean<00:04:22.940> it

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
yep the factory suspension is I mean it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.909 
yep the factory suspension is I mean it
was<00:04:23.389> they're<00:04:23.600> considered<00:04:24.590> they're<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.740> race

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
was they're considered they're a race

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.390 
was they're considered they're a race
car<00:04:25.330> it's<00:04:26.330> got<00:04:26.479> r1<00:04:26.960> suspension<00:04:27.500> on<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.740> which<00:04:28.039> I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
car it's got r1 suspension on it which I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.189 
car it's got r1 suspension on it which I
mean<00:04:28.819> even<00:04:29.210> factory<00:04:29.539> suspension<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:30.020> pretty

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
mean even factory suspension is pretty

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.340 
mean even factory suspension is pretty
stiff<00:04:30.440> so

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
stiff so

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.200 
stiff so
failing<00:04:32.920> butter<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.490> little<00:04:33.520> bit<00:04:33.820> what<00:04:34.000> why

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
failing butter and a little bit what why

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.870 
failing butter and a little bit what why
does<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.480> do<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:35.050> secondary<00:04:35.860> injectors<00:04:36.340> its

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880
