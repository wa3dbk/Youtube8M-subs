clearly<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.619> used<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> working<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.520> this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
clearly as I'm used to working with this

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.769 
clearly as I'm used to working with this
material<00:00:14.850> I<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.139> some<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.350> fine

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
material I can see some very fine

bubbles<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.199> won't<00:00:19.380> worry<00:00:19.529> too<00:00:19.800> much

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
bubbles but we won't worry too much

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.240

about<00:00:20.339> that<00:00:21.170> my<00:00:22.170> preference<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> put<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
about that my preference is to put it on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
about that my preference is to put it on
by<00:00:23.400> hand<00:00:23.720> some<00:00:24.720> people<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.259> have<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
by hand some people like to have it

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
by hand some people like to have it
rotating<00:00:26.810> just<00:00:31.160> enough<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.430> cover<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
rotating just enough to cover it and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.310 
rotating just enough to cover it and
cover<00:00:34.560> the<00:00:34.770> edge<00:00:38.600> we're<00:00:39.600> putting<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> finish

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
cover the edge we're putting the finish

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.849 
cover the edge we're putting the finish
on<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:42.390> first<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.230> doing<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> side

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
on the first of all we're doing the side

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.610 
on the first of all we're doing the side
which<00:00:44.219> has<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:45.680> two<00:00:46.680> coats<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:48.620> color

which has got two coats of color

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
which has got two coats of color
preserve<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.570> doing<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> side<00:00:52.170> which

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
preserve then we're doing the side which

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
preserve then we're doing the side which
has<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.769> no<00:00:53.129> color<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.769> expecting

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
has got no color and I'm expecting

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.670 
has got no color and I'm expecting
completely<00:00:59.969> different<00:01:00.329> results

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the rise here nope just here in this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.770 
the rise here nope just here in this
corner<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:36.680> there's<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.070> hollow<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:38.600> you

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
want is the mix to actually go down that

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.330 
want is the mix to actually go down that
hollow<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:48.140> don't<00:01:48.320> want<00:01:48.440> any<00:01:48.680> air<00:01:48.830> trapped<00:01:49.160> in

there if you can help it put that in

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.609 
there if you can help it put that in
move<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.979> finish<00:01:55.550> out<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.000> way<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:57.410> now

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
move the finish out of the way and now

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.140 
move the finish out of the way and now
I'm<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.010> start<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.490> rotary<00:01:58.880> dryer

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
I'm going to start the rotary dryer

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.530 
I'm going to start the rotary dryer
without<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.170> turning<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.880> can<00:02:02.060> see<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
without it turning you can see the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.170 
without it turning you can see the
teardrop<00:02:03.110> just<00:02:03.650> starting<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.369> form<00:02:04.760> on<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
teardrop just starting to form on the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.290 
teardrop just starting to form on the
underside<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.690> this<00:02:05.990> one<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.090> leave

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
underside of this one and if you leave

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.530 
underside of this one and if you leave
it<00:02:08.479> without<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.959> turning<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:10.369> gradually<00:02:11.060> all

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
it without it turning then gradually all

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.380 
it without it turning then gradually all
the<00:02:11.930> resin<00:02:12.290> will<00:02:12.709> come<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> one<00:02:13.220> side<00:02:13.550> some

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the resin will come to one side some

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
the resin will come to one side some
will<00:02:14.570> drop<00:02:14.810> off<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.860> ilium<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> bulge<00:02:16.700> on

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
will drop off the ilium with a bulge on

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.020 
will drop off the ilium with a bulge on
one<00:02:17.420> side<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.310> let's<00:02:19.489> get<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.760> turning<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
one side so let's get it turning and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.800 
one side so let's get it turning and
that<00:02:23.180> ensures<00:02:23.360> even<00:02:24.019> distribution<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:26.630> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
that ensures even distribution as you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.540 
that ensures even distribution as you
look<00:02:27.019> at<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:27.680> well<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.400> no

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
look at it you think well there's no

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.430 
look at it you think well there's no
bubbles<00:02:29.769> from<00:02:30.769> my<00:02:30.980> experience<00:02:31.610> with<00:02:31.970> my<00:02:32.150> eye

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
bubbles from my experience with my eye

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.560 
bubbles from my experience with my eye
yes<00:02:33.440> there<00:02:33.650> are<00:02:33.680> bubbles<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.150> need<00:02:35.360> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
yes there are bubbles so you need to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.790 
yes there are bubbles so you need to
apply<00:02:35.810> heat

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.680 

some<00:02:39.800> people<00:02:40.070> say<00:02:40.190> use<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> hairdryer<00:02:40.760> well

you'll<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.860> whisk<00:02:58.190> or<00:02:58.459> two<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:59.180> sticking

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
you'll have a whisk or two just sticking

you'll have a whisk or two just sticking
up<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.320> will<00:03:00.410> spoil<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.950> finish<00:03:01.840> probably

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

the<00:03:02.989> easiest<00:03:03.290> way<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.769> say<00:03:04.040> well<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.489> use<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
the easiest way is to say well I use the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.370 
the easiest way is to say well I use the
nightlight<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.930> help<00:03:06.410> heat

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.330 

the<00:03:11.380> hot<00:03:11.560> melt<00:03:11.830> glue<00:03:11.920> could<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.730> use<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:14.340> well

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the hot melt glue could I use that well

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.750 
the hot melt glue could I use that well
you<00:03:15.430> could<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.450> problem<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.020> candle<00:03:17.760> once

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
you could the problem is a candle once

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.710 
you could the problem is a candle once
it<00:03:18.940> starts<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> perm<00:03:19.950> will<00:03:20.950> give<00:03:21.220> off<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.790> black

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
