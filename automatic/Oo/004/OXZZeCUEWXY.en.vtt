spooky<00:00:23.599> because<00:00:24.079> the<00:00:25.040> best<00:00:25.310> prove<00:00:25.640> i<00:00:25.759> have<00:00:26.029> at

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
spooky because the best prove i have at

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.080 
spooky because the best prove i have at
the<00:00:26.239> moment<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:26.840> just<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.259> landline<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.160> should

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
the moment is just a landline so should

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.520 
the moment is just a landline so should
be<00:00:29.210> nice<00:00:30.220> checking<00:00:31.220> out<00:00:31.340> this<00:00:31.489> length<00:00:31.790> for<00:00:32.060> her

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.530 
be nice checking out this length for her

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:48.600 
be nice checking out this length for her
but<00:00:33.530> only<00:00:33.890> heard<00:00:34.850> good<00:00:34.880> things<00:00:35.149> about<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:39.280> so

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
what oh it's not my type c 2 by 2 it is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.850 
what oh it's not my type c 2 by 2 it is
the<00:00:54.760> 2<00:00:55.760> x<00:00:56.000> 2<00:00:56.270> x<00:00:56.690> 3<00:00:56.720> talc<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:58.810> okay<00:00:59.810> so<00:01:00.200> I'm<00:01:00.440> I

the 2 x 2 x 3 talc you okay so I'm I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.950 
the 2 x 2 x 3 talc you okay so I'm I
wasn't<00:01:01.250> expecting<00:01:01.400> us<00:01:01.790> to<00:01:01.910> come<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:02.270> quickly<00:01:02.570> I

wasn't expecting us to come so quickly I

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.609 
wasn't expecting us to come so quickly I
totally<00:01:03.680> around<00:01:04.129> pretty<00:01:04.460> fast<00:01:05.200> this<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.350> this

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
totally around pretty fast this is this

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.149 
totally around pretty fast this is this
looks<00:01:06.799> really<00:01:06.979> nice<00:01:07.159> n<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.869> straight<00:01:09.200> away

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:22.109 

okay<00:01:16.159> cool<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:20.210> feel<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:20.869> very<00:01:21.350> loose

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
okay cool and what feel it's very loose

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.910 
okay cool and what feel it's very loose
just<00:01:23.119> holding<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:24.999> very<00:01:25.999> loose<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.479> fact

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
just holding it and very loose in fact

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.779 
just holding it and very loose in fact
and<00:01:27.920> but<00:01:28.249> anyway<00:01:28.689> I'm<00:01:29.689> getting<00:01:30.079> into<00:01:30.700> what<00:01:31.700> it

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
and but anyway I'm getting into what it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.730 
and but anyway I'm getting into what it
looks<00:01:31.999> like<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.600> 2<00:01:32.929> x<00:01:33.139> 2<00:01:33.619> x<00:01:34.399> 3<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:35.740> also

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
looks like it is a 2 x 2 x 3 and also

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.889 
looks like it is a 2 x 2 x 3 and also
known<00:01:36.859> as<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.100> slim<00:01:37.369> tower<00:01:37.609> and<00:01:38.479> i'm<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:38.810> going

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
known as a slim tower and i'm just going

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.569 
known as a slim tower and i'm just going
to<00:01:39.079> quickly<00:01:39.380> come<00:01:39.709> right<00:01:39.889> to<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.159> three<00:01:40.399> by

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
to quickly come right to it three by

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.419 
to quickly come right to it three by
three<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.749> q<00:01:42.049> bees<00:01:42.229> are<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.530> same<00:01:42.740> size<00:01:43.039> as

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
three so the q bees are the same size as

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.629 
three so the q bees are the same size as
a<00:01:43.459> 3<00:01:43.759> by<00:01:43.939> 3<00:01:43.969> it's<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:44.810> missing<00:01:45.369> quite<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.429> few

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
a 3 by 3 it's just missing quite a few

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.910 
a 3 by 3 it's just missing quite a few
pieces<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:50.060> let's<00:01:50.990> see<00:01:51.200> how<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.380> turns

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
pieces of it so let's see how it turns

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.800 
pieces of it so let's see how it turns
is<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:53.659> pretty<00:01:54.279> nice<00:01:55.279> turn<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:58.600> it's<00:01:59.600> very

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
is it's pretty nice turn and it's very

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.989 
is it's pretty nice turn and it's very
loose<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:00.829> i<00:02:00.889> can<00:02:01.069> feel<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.609> it's<00:02:01.670> loose

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
loose so and i can feel that it's loose

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.919 
loose so and i can feel that it's loose
as<00:02:02.209> well<00:02:03.069> but<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.189> doesn't<00:02:04.579> look<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:05.719> it's

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
as well but it doesn't look like it's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.460 
as well but it doesn't look like it's
gonna<00:02:06.259> pop

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
gonna pop

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.230 
gonna pop
so<00:02:10.000> mmm<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:12.230> i<00:02:12.260> want<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.740> feel<00:02:13.610> about<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:13.910> at

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
so mmm but i want to feel about this at

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.570 
so mmm but i want to feel about this at
the<00:02:14.300> moment<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:17.630> kind<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:19.250> kind<00:02:19.460> of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the moment is it's kind of it's kind of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.900 
the moment is it's kind of it's kind of
weird<00:02:19.970> i'm<00:02:20.120> not<00:02:20.270> sure<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.940> um<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.760> it's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
weird i'm not sure I like it um so it's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.640 
weird i'm not sure I like it um so it's
very<00:02:26.060> loose<00:02:26.360> i<00:02:26.540> hope<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.960> song<00:02:27.260> who<00:02:27.530> I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
very loose i hope this song who I

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.270 
very loose i hope this song who I
contention<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.840> apparently<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:31.220> you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
contention this but apparently if you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.280 
contention this but apparently if you
can<00:02:31.520> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.300> solve<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.570> 2<00:02:32.720> by<00:02:32.900> T<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.140> can

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
can if you can solve a 2 by T you can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.560 
can if you can solve a 2 by T you can
solve<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.950> guess<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:35.090> need<00:02:35.240> some<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
solve this and guess in you need some of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.420 
solve this and guess in you need some of
the<00:02:35.630> two<00:02:35.840> by<00:02:36.050> two<00:02:36.110> algorithms<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:37.040> order<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the two by two algorithms in order to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.410 
the two by two algorithms in order to
solve<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.160> should<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.310> interesting

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
solve this so it should be interesting

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560 
solve this so it should be interesting
and<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.430> know<00:02:43.520> i<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.760> solve<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.360> i'm

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and you know i can solve it so i'm

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.050 
and you know i can solve it so i'm
actually<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.110> scramble<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:49.060> when

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
actually going to scramble it now when

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:01.930 
actually going to scramble it now when
you're<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.210> try<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.050> use<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> tutorial<00:02:51.740> oh<00:03:00.940> my

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you're a try not to use a tutorial oh my

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.670 
you're a try not to use a tutorial oh my
gosh<00:03:02.240> it's<00:03:02.600> quite<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:03.860> i<00:03:04.010> was<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> turn<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.150> like

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
gosh it's quite if i was to turn it like

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.370 
gosh it's quite if i was to turn it like
that<00:03:06.680> much<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.280> alignment<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:09.110> see

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
that much out of alignment you can see

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.480 
that much out of alignment you can see
that<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.840> piece<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.650> plastic<00:03:13.040> has<00:03:13.220> come<00:03:13.370> up

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
that the piece of plastic has come up

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.690 
that the piece of plastic has come up
here<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.760> give<00:03:14.060> your<00:03:14.180> Foresight's<00:03:14.780> gonna<00:03:15.110> pop

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
here and give your Foresight's gonna pop

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.410 
here and give your Foresight's gonna pop
so<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.030> make<00:03:17.180> really<00:03:17.600> precise<00:03:17.990> to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.850 

well<00:03:23.420> yeah<00:03:23.540> apart<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.020> that<00:03:24.110> it's<00:03:24.470> quite

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
well yeah apart from that it's quite

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.550 
well yeah apart from that it's quite
nice<00:03:25.190> I'm<00:03:25.610> going<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.820> see<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.840> reckon<00:03:28.540> might

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
nice I'm going to see I reckon might

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.850 
nice I'm going to see I reckon might
just<00:03:30.560> be<00:03:30.770> like<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:32.230> solve<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.350> middle<00:03:33.680> bun

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
just be like a solve the middle bun

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.800 
just be like a solve the middle bun
house<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.370> maybe<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.240> two<00:03:35.600> by

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
house so maybe it's just like a two by

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.200 
house so maybe it's just like a two by
two<00:03:35.840> from<00:03:36.380> here<00:03:39.670> set<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.910> fat<00:03:41.120> i<00:03:41.270> can<00:03:41.300> only<00:03:41.540> do

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
two from here set the fat i can only do

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.030 
two from here set the fat i can only do
well<00:03:44.210> maybe<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.480> use<00:03:44.780> yeah<00:03:45.290> I'm<00:03:45.680> going<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:45.890> see

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
well maybe I use yeah I'm going to see

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.190 
well maybe I use yeah I'm going to see
what<00:03:46.190> can<00:03:46.340> use<00:03:47.830> some<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.100> M<00:03:50.020> some<00:03:51.020> of<00:03:51.110> the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
what can use some of the M some of the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:05.830 
what can use some of the M some of the
cuboid<00:03:51.590> algorithms<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.400> solve<00:03:52.610> this

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.420 

so<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:06.990> video's<00:04:07.620> gonna<00:04:07.830> bit<00:04:08.040> tedious<00:04:08.280> for

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
so this video's gonna bit tedious for

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.940 
so this video's gonna bit tedious for
you<00:04:08.640> guys<00:04:08.790> oh<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.540> I've<00:04:10.050> kind<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.500> solved<00:04:10.830> it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you guys oh and I've kind of solved it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.900 
you guys oh and I've kind of solved it
already<00:04:12.950> apart<00:04:13.950> from<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.370> middle<00:04:14.700> part

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
already apart from the middle part

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.569 
already apart from the middle part
Stella<00:04:15.630> silicon<00:04:17.390> solve<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.600> part<00:04:18.930> oh<00:04:19.579> so

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
Stella silicon solve that part oh so

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.830 
Stella silicon solve that part oh so
there<00:04:20.730> just<00:04:20.880> seemed<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.060> be<00:04:21.269> some<00:04:21.510> kind<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
there just seemed to be some kind of

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.740 
there just seemed to be some kind of
pirate<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.230> like<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.590> get<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.750> but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
pirate you like you can get on this but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.460 
pirate you like you can get on this but
problem<00:04:25.230> at<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.500> was<00:04:25.620> pretty<00:04:25.860> easy<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.400> solve

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
problem at it was pretty easy to solve

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.900 
problem at it was pretty easy to solve
pretty<00:04:28.470> much<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:29.120> two-book<00:04:30.120> 3<00:04:30.420> x<00:04:30.540> 3<00:04:30.570> x<00:04:30.780> 4

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
pretty much like a two-book 3 x 3 x 4

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.210 
pretty much like a two-book 3 x 3 x 4
set<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.270> middle<00:04:34.020> part<00:04:34.200> cancels<00:04:34.530> one<00:04:34.920> block

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
set this middle part cancels one block

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.480 
set this middle part cancels one block
so<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.210> 2<00:04:36.390> x<00:04:36.510> 2<00:04:36.540> x<00:04:36.810> 3<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:37.770> kind<00:04:37.980> of<00:04:38.010> nice<00:04:38.130> guy

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
so the 2 x 2 x 3 it's kind of nice guy

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.320 
so the 2 x 2 x 3 it's kind of nice guy
