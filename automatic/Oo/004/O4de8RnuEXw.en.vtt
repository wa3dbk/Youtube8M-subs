that<00:02:04.880> looks<00:02:05.120> like<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.170> hunters

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
that looks like and a lot of hunters

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.410 
that looks like and a lot of hunters
will<00:02:06.650> think<00:02:06.890> that's<00:02:07.100> good<00:02:07.310> enough<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.790> then

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
will think that's good enough and then

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.759 
will think that's good enough and then
after<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.840> I'm<00:02:09.049> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> stubble<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.649> up

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
after that I'm going to stubble it up

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.680 
after that I'm going to stubble it up
how<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.610> hunt<00:02:10.819> with<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.239> that<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.510> just

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
how I like to hunt with and that is just

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.449 
how I like to hunt with and that is just
packed<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.440> gills<00:02:12.530> with<00:02:12.860> natural<00:02:13.250> cover

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
packed to the gills with natural cover

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.309 
packed to the gills with natural cover
and<00:02:13.940> I'll<00:02:14.360> show<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.780> difference<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.260> I

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
and I'll show you the difference and I

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.350 
and I'll show you the difference and I
think<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.739> your<00:02:15.920> start<00:02:16.220> putting<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.090> lot<00:02:17.239> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
think that your start putting a lot of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.119 
think that your start putting a lot of
cover<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.659> your<00:02:17.690> blind<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.290> making<00:02:18.830> yourself

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
cover on your blind and making yourself

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.160 
cover on your blind and making yourself
blend<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.709> difference

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.960 

now<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.890> here<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.250> kind<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.670> halfway

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
now this here is kind of that halfway

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.430 
now this here is kind of that halfway
point<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.690> was<00:02:26.870> talking<00:02:27.080> about<00:02:27.260> earlier

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
point that I was talking about earlier

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.410 
point that I was talking about earlier
this<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> lot<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.880> hunters<00:02:29.090> will<00:02:29.270> do

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
this is what a lot of hunters will do

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
this is what a lot of hunters will do
they<00:02:29.900> put<00:02:30.140> on<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.620> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:32.170> cover<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
they put on a little bit of cover in the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.920 
they put on a little bit of cover in the
morning<00:02:33.470> they're<00:02:33.950> running<00:02:34.280> late<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:34.970> miss

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
morning they're running late they miss

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720 
morning they're running late they miss
their<00:02:36.110> alarm<00:02:36.410> clock<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.040> they're<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.640> to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
their alarm clock and they're going to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.750 
their alarm clock and they're going to
shortchange<00:02:38.000> themself<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.459> then<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.610> first

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
shortchange themself and then that first

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
shortchange themself and then that first
flock<00:02:41.060> comes<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:41.990> sometimes<00:02:42.560> I'm<00:02:42.740> early

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
flock comes in one sometimes I'm early

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.160 
flock comes in one sometimes I'm early
flocks<00:02:43.220> finish<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:43.970> well<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.390> then<00:02:44.930> once

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
flocks finish really well and then once

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.840 
flocks finish really well and then once
it<00:02:45.320> gets<00:02:45.350> daylight<00:02:45.860> out<00:02:46.070> they<00:02:46.430> can't<00:02:46.670> figure

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
it gets daylight out they can't figure

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.460 
it gets daylight out they can't figure
out<00:02:47.000> why<00:02:47.209> those<00:02:47.450> geese<00:02:47.690> aren't<00:02:47.930> finishing<00:02:48.320> and

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
out why those geese aren't finishing and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.530 
out why those geese aren't finishing and
it's<00:02:48.800> because<00:02:49.010> their<00:02:49.220> blinds<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.300> not

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's because their blinds are just not

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.840 
it's because their blinds are just not
camouflaged<00:02:51.110> enough<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.130> just<00:02:52.310> cannot<00:02:52.610> get

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
camouflaged enough you just cannot get

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.690 
camouflaged enough you just cannot get
covered<00:02:53.239> up<00:02:53.300> enough<00:02:53.630> if<00:02:54.440> there's<00:02:54.830> two<00:02:55.430> things

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
covered up enough if there's two things

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.040 
covered up enough if there's two things
you<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:55.880> take<00:02:56.090> away<00:02:56.239> from<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.570> video<00:02:56.870> it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
you can take away from this video it's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.260 
you can take away from this video it's
number<00:02:57.290> one<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:58.010> yourself<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.459> an<00:02:58.580> incredible

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
number one get yourself in an incredible

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.750 
number one get yourself in an incredible
location<00:02:59.810> location<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.470> key<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.400> kill<00:03:01.610> and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
location location is key to kill and

location location is key to kill and
snow<00:03:01.940> geese<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:02.750> after<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.920> sure

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
snow geese and then after that make sure

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.930 
snow geese and then after that make sure
you're<00:03:04.280> concealed

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
you're concealed

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.270 
you're concealed
if<00:03:05.030> those<00:03:05.330> geese<00:03:05.600> see<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.739> lights<00:03:07.070> out

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
if those geese see you it's lights out

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.610 
if those geese see you it's lights out
and<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.030> geese<00:03:08.209> wind<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.080> make<00:03:09.260> sure<00:03:09.290> you're

and the geese wind so make sure you're
camouflaged<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.489> I'm<00:03:11.030> gonna<00:03:11.150> get<00:03:11.330> back<00:03:11.360> to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
camouflaged so I'm gonna get back to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.540 
camouflaged so I'm gonna get back to
cutting<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.019> camouflaging<00:03:12.709> this<00:03:12.860> blind<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.340 
cutting that camouflaging this blind and
I'm<00:03:13.640> gonna<00:03:13.790> show<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.060> what<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.690> completely

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
I'm gonna show you what a completely

I'm gonna show you what a completely
camouflage<00:03:15.890> blind<00:03:16.220> looks<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:31.060> think

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
camouflage blind looks like I think

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.970 
camouflage blind looks like I think
that's<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.870> what<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.260> would<00:03:33.470> call<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
that's it this is what you would call a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
that's it this is what you would call a
completely<00:03:34.579> concealed<00:03:35.030> blind<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.290> start

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
completely concealed blind if you start

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
portions I guarantee you you'll start

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.220 
portions I guarantee you you'll start
killing<00:03:43.700> more<00:03:43.850> snow<00:03:44.090> geese<00:03:44.269> but<00:03:44.690> we<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.110> go

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
killing more snow geese but we can go

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.340 
killing more snow geese but we can go
one<00:03:45.410> step<00:03:45.650> further<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.350> start

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
one step further and that is start

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.160 
one step further and that is start
putting<00:03:49.010> some<00:03:49.220> decoys<00:03:49.640> up<00:03:50.090> around<00:03:50.480> your<00:03:50.660> blind

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.199
