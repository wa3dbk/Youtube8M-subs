00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.240 
here taste their money hmm that's
perfect<00:01:44.380> now<00:01:44.440> what<00:01:44.680> we<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
perfect now what we have to do is

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.980 
perfect now what we have to do is
separate<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.820> water<00:01:46.000> from<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.390> pasta<00:01:46.600> and

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
separate the water from the pasta and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.480 
separate the water from the pasta and
the<00:01:47.229> oil<00:01:47.440> from<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.830> water<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.220> would<00:01:48.400> be

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the oil from the water this would be

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.430 
the oil from the water this would be
very<00:01:48.640> easy<00:01:48.729> if<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.330> had<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.540> laboratory<00:01:49.930> style

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
very easy if we had a laboratory style

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.350 
very easy if we had a laboratory style
to<00:01:50.680> introduce<00:01:51.040> but<00:01:51.729> we're<00:01:51.850> on<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:51.970> budget<00:01:52.180> here

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
to introduce but we're on a budget here

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:33.170 
to introduce but we're on a budget here
so<00:01:52.750> I'll<00:01:52.869> have<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.140> try<00:01:53.350> something<00:01:53.830> else

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.030 

now<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.570> have<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.750> do<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.140> let<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> pasta

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
now all we have to do is let the pasta

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
now all we have to do is let the pasta
drain<00:02:36.430> them<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.670> give<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.210> few<00:02:37.450> minutes

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
drain them in give just a few minutes

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.460 
drain them in give just a few minutes
for<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> oil<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.620> rise<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> top

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.759 

let's<00:02:46.470> see<00:02:46.800> our<00:02:47.069> oil<00:02:47.250> column<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:49.080> quarter

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
let's see our oil column is one quarter

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.670 
let's see our oil column is one quarter
inches<00:02:50.220> deep<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.790> two<00:02:51.000> inches<00:02:51.360> across<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.750> PI

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
inches deep and two inches across so PI

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.070 
inches deep and two inches across so PI

here is point four three ounces of olive
oil<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.110> means<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.950> we<00:03:05.310> actually

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
oil that means that we actually

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.920 
oil that means that we actually
recaptured<00:03:06.330> about<00:03:06.920> 85<00:03:07.920> maybe<00:03:08.310> 86<00:03:09.060> percent<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
recaptured about 85 maybe 86 percent of

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.650 
recaptured about 85 maybe 86 percent of
the<00:03:10.230> original<00:03:10.920> oil<00:03:11.130> which<00:03:11.400> means<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.970> all

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the original oil which means that all

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.509 
the original oil which means that all
this<00:03:12.840> water<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.470> all<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.560> pasta<00:03:14.129> up<00:03:14.280> there

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
this water and all that pasta up there

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.000 
this water and all that pasta up there
is<00:03:14.640> managed<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.269> absorb<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.470> another<00:03:16.860> way

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
is managed to absorb or another way

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.880 
is managed to absorb or another way
possess<00:03:17.819> only<00:03:18.000> about<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.569> half<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.410> teaspoon

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
possess only about a half a teaspoon

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.920 
possess only about a half a teaspoon
maybe<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.610> oil<00:03:20.790> which<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.060> seriously<00:03:21.330> doubt<00:03:21.660> is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
maybe of oil which I seriously doubt is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.080 
maybe of oil which I seriously doubt is
enough<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.560> lubricate<00:03:23.130> each<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.760> every<00:03:23.940> one

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
enough to lubricate each and every one

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.850 
enough to lubricate each and every one
of<00:03:24.120> those<00:03:24.299> noodles<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> course<00:03:24.989> there<00:03:25.709> could

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
of those noodles of course there could

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.319 
of those noodles of course there could
be<00:03:25.890> another<00:03:26.250> reason<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.670> putting<00:03:26.970> oil<00:03:27.150> in

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
be another reason for putting oil in

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.339 
be another reason for putting oil in
pasta<00:03:27.690> water<00:03:27.840> come<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:29.780> come<00:03:30.780> home<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.230> you're

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
pasta water come on come home and you're

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.050 
pasta water come on come home and you're
hungry<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.920> put<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> pot<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.579> water<00:03:32.730> for

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
hungry so you put on a pot of water for

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.030 
hungry so you put on a pot of water for
pasta<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.540> bring<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> boil<00:03:34.349> then<00:03:34.709> you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
pasta you bring it to a boil then you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680 
pasta you bring it to a boil then you
put<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> pasta<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.670> then<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.269> not<00:03:36.420> boiling

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
put the pasta in then it's not boiling

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.809 
put the pasta in then it's not boiling
anymore<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.410> put<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.980> lid<00:03:38.220> then<00:03:38.730> you

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
anymore so you put on a lid then you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.569 
anymore so you put on a lid then you
turn<00:03:39.000> around<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.780> find<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.290> big<00:03:41.160> nasty

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
turn around and you find this big nasty

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.520 
turn around and you find this big nasty
mess<00:03:42.209> happening<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.989> big<00:03:43.170> pile<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
mess happening see that big pile of

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.210 
mess happening see that big pile of
bubbles<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.819> happens<00:03:45.360> because<00:03:45.930> as<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.890> cooks

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
bubbles that happens because as it cooks

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.270 
bubbles that happens because as it cooks
the<00:03:47.519> pasta<00:03:48.269> washes<00:03:48.900> off<00:03:49.109> starch<00:03:49.859> into<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the pasta washes off starch into the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.099 
the pasta washes off starch into the
water<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.090> changes<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.540> surface

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
water and that changes the surface

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.620 
water and that changes the surface
tension<00:03:52.590> creating<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.519> big<00:03:53.850> foam<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.480> kind

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
tension creating this big foam it's kind

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.699 
tension creating this big foam it's kind
of<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.780> when<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.959> go<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.260> beach<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.650> a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of like when you go to the beach on a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.500 
of like when you go to the beach on a
windy<00:03:56.069> day<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.459> see<00:03:56.609> this<00:03:56.700> big<00:03:56.880> things<00:03:57.389> of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
windy day and you see this big things of

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.240 
windy day and you see this big things of
foam<00:03:57.750> on<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.109> waves<00:03:58.290> only<00:03:58.530> that's<00:03:58.769> protein

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
foam on the waves only that's protein

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.210 
foam on the waves only that's protein
and<00:03:59.489> this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.209> starch<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:01.530> if<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:02.010> were<00:04:02.100> to

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and this is starch now if you were to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.550 
and this is starch now if you were to
add<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> good<00:04:02.760> bit<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.120> oil<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:04.350> water

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
add a good bit of oil to the water

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.099 
add a good bit of oil to the water
before<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.160> started<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.239> whole<00:04:06.450> process

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
before you started this whole process

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.470 
before you started this whole process
then<00:04:07.799> there's<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.519> good<00:04:08.760> chance<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.239> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
then there's a very good chance that the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.660 
then there's a very good chance that the
chemical<00:04:10.170> bonds<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.829> starch<00:04:11.160> we<00:04:11.370> get<00:04:11.489> so

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
chemical bonds and the starch we get so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.400 
chemical bonds and the starch we get so
lubricated<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:12.480> bubbles<00:04:12.780> put<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:13.139> form

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
lubricated that the bubbles put in form

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.250 
lubricated that the bubbles put in form
no<00:04:13.709> bubbles<00:04:14.130> no<00:04:14.579> foam<00:04:14.850> no<00:04:15.120> boiling<00:04:15.810> over<00:04:15.959> and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
no bubbles no foam no boiling over and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.110 
no bubbles no foam no boiling over and
it's<00:04:16.440> facing<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:17.070> doesn't<00:04:17.370> look<00:04:17.489> very<00:04:17.519> much

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's facing that doesn't look very much

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.599 
it's facing that doesn't look very much
like<00:04:18.329> good<00:04:18.750> eats<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.500> more<00:04:19.709> practical<00:04:20.190> answer

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
like good eats the more practical answer

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.830 
like good eats the more practical answer
to<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.820> problem<00:04:21.239> really<00:04:21.329> though<00:04:21.539> is<00:04:21.690> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
to the problem really though is to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.219 
to the problem really though is to
simply<00:04:22.200> use<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.680> bigger<00:04:22.979> pot<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.789> more<00:04:24.330> water

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
simply use a bigger pot and more water

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.260 
simply use a bigger pot and more water
okay<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:26.010> way<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> noodles<00:04:26.639> have<00:04:26.760> plenty<00:04:27.150> of

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
okay that way the noodles have plenty of

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.000 
okay that way the noodles have plenty of
room<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.479> move<00:04:27.930> around<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.470> they<00:04:28.590> cook<00:04:28.800> nice

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
room to move around so they cook nice

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.029 
room to move around so they cook nice
and<00:04:29.039> evenly<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.539> starch<00:04:30.870> dissipates<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.919> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
and evenly the starch dissipates to the

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.680 
and evenly the starch dissipates to the
to<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> point<00:04:32.639> that<00:04:32.820> they<00:04:33.000> just<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:33.570> no

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
to the point that they just there's no

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
rule at least in my house is that I

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.230 
rule at least in my house is that I
never<00:04:40.410> cook<00:04:41.010> in<00:04:41.220> less<00:04:41.460> than<00:04:41.550> half<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.880> gallon<00:04:42.000> of
