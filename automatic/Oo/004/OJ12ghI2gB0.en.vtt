00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello yourself dark legends and like 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.340
 promised that day I will be back before 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.949
 than i will announce you the exit list 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.800
 Iâ€™ll start the next issues with a brief 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 review on many interesting movie 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 Transformers 4 era of extermination let's 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.590
 open our eyes to the truth of transformers 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.960
 always been considered films for children from 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.930
 line on the comics here arises controversial 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.390
 the moment is about transformers that's for sure 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.489
 the plot was never original 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
 and was made up of Hollywood receptions 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 from which so full of food 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 you predict almost the whole movie though so 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.090
 spin that in some moments and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 mistaken franchise always kept action 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.800
 After all, for these viewers always went to the movies 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.379
 but confess to the pose of pacific 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.960
 turnaround transformers are no longer so surprised 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.300
 and emotions got from turn in aimax and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 far more than from robots in 3d 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.400
 for the third part like many i 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.340
 had a rest but no special impressions 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
 therefore made what to expect from 4 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.650
 parts that starts already new 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.080
 storyline and as well guessed 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.140
 the fourth part is shot in the same style 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 that and the trilogy is a secondary plot with 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.600
 lots of stupid things with many 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670
 familiar plot twists for example 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 father bought an old truck 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 and he turns out to be autobot nothing 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.909
 reminds 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 action same spectacular on 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.079
 pacific line anyway better 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.299
 the truth is something in this picture makes me very 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.700
 glad Michael Bay is already making progress 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.799
 when choosing actors and now I haven't 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.799
 blood from the ears of cries sam 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.189
 Uituiki 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.259
 new characters in the franchise were in place 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 brutal mark wahlberg which only 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 dragged his game the whole film played 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.340
 very cool and oh thank god finally on 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.679
 female 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.710
 chose the actress that was well 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.500
 nice to look not momentarily bad not about 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.899
 god rosie huntington whiteley 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.300
 didn't look as good as frame 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.900
 Nicola finger 2 also played a very 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.720
 badly 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 emotions expressed very weakly probably when 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.769
 filming she had a bad idea 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.010
 Transformers but what's more surprising 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.860
 there are many moments of teana calmly 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.010
 it should not be in this frame alone 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.069
 and how the director could overlook it 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.799
 did the character jack save on film 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.269
 Raynor and in some boring he even me 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.579
 to some extent resembles so nothing about 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.879
 who have not forgotten and Stanley Tucci 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.040
 luboj and terrible laughter also praise 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.299
 composer steve and lonsky and group 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 imagine Dragons 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.700
 their track is just mesmerizing the rest 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.250
 I will not praise the plot is interesting but only on 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.500
 once the action is solid but he is not 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.910
 should be clumsy or else the film would 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.879
 there was nothing to watch 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.700
 for the sake of rest it is worth looking exactly 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.190
 for the sake of the brand wahlberg michael bey chiefly 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.680
 there is some secret of success then even 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.620
 from annoying franchise to and i need 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.290
 do a sequel he care with them and 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 take it off so that the viewer can again 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
 rest and the transformers were again 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 popular in the market 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
 for parents to buy for their children 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.950
 comics 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.470
 toys and manufacturers would get 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.720
 profit become and I'm not sure about it 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.230
 It seems in part 4 to be used product 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.900
 placement 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.450
 the fourth part is not the last but in one 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.329
 I am sure he will always be like that 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.510
 what was the usual fantastic 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.909
 movies with minor changes 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.510
 you come to me for a rest and 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.840
 will forget now briefly schedule after 3 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.599
 days you will see 2 full review more through 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.209
 three you will see the next release of actors 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.000
 and then you see the top 10 Russian 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.459
 films shot and by modern standards 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.530
 Thanks for watching, I shared my 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.549

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.910
 all for now start with the fact that the line 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.789
 the future is for me one of 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.250
 most anticipated this year and left on 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.289
