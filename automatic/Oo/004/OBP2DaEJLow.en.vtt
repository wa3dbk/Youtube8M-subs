00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:07.877
 Hi friends 

00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:08.936
 How are you all? 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.100
 Welcome to your channel CocinaBlog 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 I am very happy to be here with you 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.700
 inaugurating the channel in a very sweet way 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.800
 starting with what is a rich and delicious homemade flan 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.520
 I will show them in a very easy and practical way 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.820
 Below I will show you the ingredients 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.180
 and the ingredients are the following 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.280
 we have what are two cans of half cream 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.260
 two tins of the nestle brand nestle 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.080
 two cans of evaporated milk from the carnation brand 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 We're going to need two cups of sugar 

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:51.944
 8 eggs 

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.135
 and two tablespoons of vanilla essence 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 I'm going to use two tablespoons but it's very much to my liking 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.020
 very good friends, I'm going to start in two parts 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.560
 let's start with a can of the milkmaid 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 one half cream 

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.831
 a can of evaporated carnetion 

00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:08.981
 four eggs 

00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:10.863
 and a spoonful of vanilla 

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:12.168
 we shake them perfectly 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.771
 I am going to start 

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:15.861
 I'm going to pour the milk 

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:23.134
 an evaporated milk 

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.691
 and a half cream 

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.161
 4 eggs 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.080
 and a spoonful of vanilla 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.380
 depending on the taste there are those who put up half a spoonful and there are those who up to two 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 then once the ingredients are mixed well 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.680
 I'm going to pour them in this container 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 to join it with the second part 

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:29.873
 very well 

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:31.887
 and continued with the second part 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.800
 since we were left pending what is another half cream 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.240
 another milkmaid 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.260
 and the carnation 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.220
 then we continue with what we needed 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.680
 the milkmaid I'm pouring here what is the milkmaid 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 4 eggs 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.854
 and a spoonful of vanilla 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 Well this I had not told you is of the brand PASA 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.059
 it's vanilla essence 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.373
 let's put a spoonful 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 very good friends 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.980
 once the ingredients are well mixed 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.600
 we are going to join it with the first part in the container where previously the first 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.300
 and we put them together 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.200
 and now if I already have all the mixture in a single container 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560
 Previously I advise you to light the oven 10 or 15 minutes before 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.020
 to put the mold so that it is heated 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.874
 let's proceed to prepare the sugar 

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:53.687
 which is going to be the candy 

00:03:53.687 --> 00:03:55.254
 let's light the frying pan 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 and let's wait for it to warm up a bit 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.700
 there we poured the two cups 

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:09.760
 of sugar 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.080
 we are going to extend it so that the heat comes quickly 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.815
 well here we are seeing how this is changing color 

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:19.562
 it's starting to melt 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.197
 so let's put together what is needed 

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.171
 with what is already melting 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.080
 so that everything reaches melt 

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:30.588
 it is crushed 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.500
 Now let's pour the candy over the mold 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.189
 and so we're going to expand it all over the mold 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.460
 and there we will leave it until it dries to pour the mixture 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.460
 once the candy is dry 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.020
 we can pour the mixture of the ingredients 

00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:04.114
 what we have here 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.300
 we empty all the mixture on the mold 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.420
 how are we going to prepare in a bain-marie in the oven we are going to use an aluminum container 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 to pour the mold here and put it in the oven 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.560
 let's cover it perfectly with aluminum foil 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.790
 before putting it in the oven 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.800
 that is well sealed by all the edges 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.260
 and here we are going to pour some water 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:38.519
 it's less than a quarter 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.240
 less than a quarter of water so that it will not be thrown away 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 we introduce the mold 

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:49.233
 let's put it in the oven 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.776
 and in the oven it will stay for between 45 min and one hour 

00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:12.276
 An hour later 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.940
 I just removed the flan from the oven which remained for one hour at high heat 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.520
 the next step is to let it cool 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.660
 to be able to remove it from the mold without it going to break or crumble 

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.752
 I have a good time 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.640
 and the next thing is let's uncover 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.940
 see the consistency is a little harder 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.320
 what follows is let's move the knife along the edge of the mold 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.680
 to be able to take off and pass it to another container 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.700
 a technique to know if the custard is ready is to pass the knife and if it has no lumps 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.880
 if it leaves no traces, it is because it is ready 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.780
 now we are going to move it to a wide plate 

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:10.589
 what we are going to do is 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:11.934
 put it on the mold 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.870
 and we're going to flip one 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.740
 So here we have our homemade flan ready to be eaten 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.849
 ok friends poetry here I show you 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.240
 this would be our rich homemade flan 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.540
 I hope you enjoy it in the company of your family and your loved ones 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.560
 a hug and I see them in the next video 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.700
 and now if we're going to try our flan 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.940
 to see how we stayed 

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 MMM..
