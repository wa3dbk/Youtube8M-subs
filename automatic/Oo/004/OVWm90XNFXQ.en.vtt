00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.030 
well turd know something near the
beginning<00:00:09.360> basically<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.469> burn<00:00:10.769> tree

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
beginning basically we have to burn tree

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.820 
beginning basically we have to burn tree
beehives<00:00:11.490> over<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.440> get<00:00:13.440> inside<00:00:13.799> that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
beehives over here and get inside that

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.240 
beehives over here and get inside that
building<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.080> clear<00:00:16.080> safe<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
building and clear safe which is in the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.609 
building and clear safe which is in the
basement<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> approached<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> place<00:00:19.410> from

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
basement so I approached the place from

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
basement so I approached the place from
behind<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:22.670> we<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> beehives<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
behind so we can do the beehives first I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.980 
behind so we can do the beehives first I
suppose<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
suppose and this is how we do it if you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.470 
suppose and this is how we do it if you
I<00:00:28.019> kill<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.470> guy<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:30.420> tariff<00:00:30.810> first<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
I kill this guy in the tariff first and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.130 
I kill this guy in the tariff first and
then<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> guides<00:00:34.920> should<00:00:35.190> run<00:00:35.399> over<00:00:39.140> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
then all the guides should run over so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.639 
then all the guides should run over so
you<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> burn<00:00:41.309> tree<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> these<00:00:42.379> is<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you want to burn tree of these is if you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.700 
you want to burn tree of these is if you
burn<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.690> even<00:00:45.690> blackbriar<00:00:46.200> something

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
burn more than even blackbriar something

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
burn more than even blackbriar something
goes<00:00:47.129> crazy<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> because

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
goes crazy we don't want that because

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.299 
goes crazy we don't want that because
you<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:49.879> kodokan<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> paden

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
you don't get your kodokan of the paden

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
you don't get your kodokan of the paden

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so I'm probably jump down here there's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.000 
so I'm probably jump down here there's
an<00:00:55.559> urn<00:00:55.710> route<00:00:55.890> boom<00:00:57.559> okay<00:00:58.559> there's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:58.980> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
guards all running over because the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.910
