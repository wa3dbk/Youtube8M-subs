about two hours into the game and I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
notice if you move the camera too fast

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
notice if you move the camera too fast
that<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.090> screen<00:02:27.480> starts<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.020> blur<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> little

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that the screen starts to blur a little

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.570 
that the screen starts to blur a little
but<00:02:29.190> other<00:02:29.340> than<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.850> game<00:02:30.030> runs<00:02:30.300> great

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510 
but other than that the game runs great
and<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.320> fair<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.070> still<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> feature

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
and to be fair this is still a feature

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.190 
and to be fair this is still a feature
they're<00:02:35.760> working<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.540> performance<00:02:36.810> could

they're working on the performance could

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.630 
they're working on the performance could
get<00:02:37.380> better<00:02:37.500> or<00:02:37.800> worse<00:02:38.010> than<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.340> coming

get better or worse than the coming
months<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:43.440> conclusion<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:44.280> overall

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
months in conclusion my overall

impression<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> xbox<00:02:45.540> one's<00:02:45.960> backwards

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
impression of the xbox one's backwards

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.260 
impression of the xbox one's backwards
compatibility<00:02:47.040> feature<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.520> its<00:02:47.820> pretty<00:02:48.060> good

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
compatibility feature is its pretty good

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330 
compatibility feature is its pretty good
so<00:02:48.450> far<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.930> wish<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.530> had<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> chance<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.130> try

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so far I wish I had the chance to try

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.580 
so far I wish I had the chance to try
out<00:02:50.370> some<00:02:50.820> multiplayer<00:02:51.090> games<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.900> i<00:02:52.110> think

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
out some multiplayer games but i think

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.900 
out some multiplayer games but i think
i'll<00:02:52.710> be<00:02:52.830> able<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.100> try<00:02:53.280> them<00:02:53.460> out<00:02:53.580> eventually

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
i'll be able to try them out eventually

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.310 
i'll be able to try them out eventually
when<00:02:54.240> more<00:02:54.420> games<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.840> added<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
when more games get added to the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.040 
when more games get added to the
compatible<00:02:55.830> list<00:02:56.040> i<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:57.090> enjoy<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.660> ability

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
compatible list i do enjoy the ability

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.870 
compatible list i do enjoy the ability
to<00:02:58.200> play<00:02:58.350> games<00:02:58.590> i<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:58.800> yet<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.520> example

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to play games i have yet to for example

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.610 
to play games i have yet to for example
i<00:03:00.000> never<00:03:00.510> got<00:03:00.690> around<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.990> finishing<00:03:01.050> mass

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
i never got around to finishing mass

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.860 
i never got around to finishing mass
effect<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.030> perfect<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.570> me<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.780> I'm

enjoying it a lot I must admit though I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.260 
enjoying it a lot I must admit though I
am<00:03:07.020> worried<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.710> hope<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.370> publishers<00:03:08.910> do<00:03:09.120> get

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
am worried I hope that publishers do get

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.820 
am worried I hope that publishers do get
on<00:03:09.300> board<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.840> sign<00:03:09.990> their<00:03:10.170> games<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.710> be

will<00:03:23.520> be<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> killer<00:03:23.970> feature<00:03:24.240> though<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.780> just

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
will be a killer feature though or just

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.110 
will be a killer feature though or just
a<00:03:25.380> flop<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.920> sure<00:03:26.220> hope<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.610> ends<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.910> being

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
a flop but I sure hope it ends up being
