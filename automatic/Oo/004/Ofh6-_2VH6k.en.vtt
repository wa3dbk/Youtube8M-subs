their head that it's going to be coming

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.769 
their head that it's going to be coming
out<00:00:29.650> on<00:00:29.829> for<00:00:30.099> 20<00:00:30.489> some<00:00:31.239> people<00:00:31.509> made<00:00:31.660> the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
out on for 20 some people made the

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.500 
out on for 20 some people made the
connection<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:32.380> know<00:00:32.410> hi<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.640> for<00:00:33.940> 20<00:00:34.329> they

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
connection you know hi and for 20 they

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.850 
connection you know hi and for 20 they
think<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:35.050> could<00:00:35.079> be<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.320> possible<00:00:35.739> day

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
think that that could be a possible day

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.229 
think that that could be a possible day
and<00:00:36.010> that<00:00:36.130> you<00:00:36.430> know<00:00:36.519> that<00:00:36.670> does<00:00:36.850> make<00:00:37.030> some

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
and that you know that does make some

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.840 
and that you know that does make some
sense<00:00:37.300> but<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.739> just<00:00:38.920> doesn't<00:00:39.100> look<00:00:39.370> probable

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
sense but it just doesn't look probable

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.700 
sense but it just doesn't look probable
I<00:00:39.969> don't<00:00:40.120> think<00:00:40.329> Rockstar<00:00:40.899> really<00:00:41.410> cares

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
I don't think Rockstar really cares

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.950 
I don't think Rockstar really cares
about<00:00:41.829> 420<00:00:42.699> at<00:00:42.820> all<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.600> think<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.870> has

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
about 420 at all and I think it has

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.139 
about 420 at all and I think it has
anything<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.410> do<00:00:44.649> with<00:00:44.679> that<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.250> some<00:00:46.059> other

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
anything to do with that and some other

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.400 
anything to do with that and some other
things<00:00:46.269> point<00:00:46.780> towards<00:00:47.019> that<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.170> know<00:00:47.260> rock

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
things point towards that you know rock

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.560 
things point towards that you know rock
star<00:00:47.649> is<00:00:47.859> a<00:00:48.100> creature<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:48.940> their<00:00:49.089> habits<00:00:49.449> they

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
star is a creature of their habits they

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.729 
star is a creature of their habits they

usually before a big deal scene comes

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.590 
usually before a big deal scene comes
out<00:01:06.460> they<00:01:06.730> would<00:01:06.850> put<00:01:07.060> out<00:01:07.150> some<00:01:07.420> type<00:01:07.570> of

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
that talked about everything but then

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.800 
that talked about everything but then
there'd<00:01:11.890> be<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.070> separate<00:01:12.550> update<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.660> would

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
there'd be a separate update that would

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.480 
there'd be a separate update that would
tell<00:01:14.050> us<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.530> know<00:01:14.560> it's<00:01:14.980> like<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.280> hype

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
tell us and you know it's like the hype

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.030 
tell us and you know it's like the hype
it<00:01:15.730> up<00:01:15.880> before<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.450> comes<00:01:16.720> out<00:01:16.870> well<00:01:17.260> when<00:01:17.950> this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
it up before it comes out well when this

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.590 
it up before it comes out well when this
video<00:01:18.370> comes<00:01:18.640> out<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.180> probably<00:01:19.420> going

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
video comes out this is probably going

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.750 
video comes out this is probably going
to<00:01:19.660> come<00:01:19.810> out<00:01:19.870> either<00:01:20.290> late<00:01:20.920> Tuesday<00:01:21.550> or

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
to come out either late Tuesday or

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.370 
to come out either late Tuesday or
Wednesday<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.480> that<00:01:22.900> would<00:01:23.020> mean<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.230> we

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
Wednesday and that would mean that we

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.610 
Wednesday and that would mean that we
only<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.950> four<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:25.000> three<00:01:25.180> days<00:01:25.360> before<00:01:25.660> 420

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
only have four to three days before 420

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.490 
only have four to three days before 420
before<00:01:27.010> Easter<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.180> have<00:01:28.360> nothing<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:29.260> it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
before Easter and we have nothing so it

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.830 
before Easter and we have nothing so it
doesn't<00:01:29.830> look<00:01:29.920> probable<00:01:30.490> at<00:01:30.610> all<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:31.810> I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
doesn't look probable at all also I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.230 
doesn't look probable at all also I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
know so the way it's looking like right

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
know so the way it's looking like right
now<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.720> could<00:03:07.930> be<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.260> best<00:03:08.440> possibilities

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
now that could be the best possibilities

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.400
