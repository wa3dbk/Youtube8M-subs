actually certain closing that div there

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.640 
actually certain closing that div there
for<00:03:36.670> me<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.670> be<00:03:39.730> incorrect<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:41.230> don't

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
for me this would be incorrect you don't

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.100 
for me this would be incorrect you don't
need<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.010> close<00:03:42.220> your<00:03:42.280> image<00:03:42.730> tags<00:03:43.090> I'm<00:03:43.870> just

going to go and delete that save it and
then<00:03:47.019> we'll<00:03:47.290> preview<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.970> browser<00:03:49.000> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
then we'll preview this in a browser and

then we'll preview this in a browser and
you'll<00:03:50.410> see<00:03:50.680> there<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.430> my<00:03:52.420> image<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.800> very

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
you'll see there is my image so very

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.790 
you'll see there is my image so very
easy<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.820> insert<00:03:55.300> images<00:03:55.959> into<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:57.760> pages

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
easy to insert images into your pages

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.160 
easy to insert images into your pages
now<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:01.390> can<00:04:01.600> also<00:04:01.900> use<00:04:02.470> an<00:04:02.680> image<00:04:03.130> as<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.430> link

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
now you can also use an image as a link

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.880 
now you can also use an image as a link
and<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.300> again<00:04:08.110> very<00:04:08.290> simple

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
and to do that again very simple

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.310 
and to do that again very simple
remember<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.850> basic<00:04:10.269> format<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.959> we<00:04:11.080> had

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
remember the basic format that we had

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.840 
remember the basic format that we had
here<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:12.360> our<00:04:13.360> links<00:04:13.900> we<00:04:14.860> had<00:04:15.070> an<00:04:15.190> opening<00:04:15.640> a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
here for our links we had an opening a

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.199 
here for our links we had an opening a
tag<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.540> then<00:04:17.380> an<00:04:17.560> href<00:04:18.160> attribute<00:04:18.459> that

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
tag and then an href attribute that

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.750 
tag and then an href attribute that
pointed<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.200> item<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.310> wanted<00:04:21.640> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
pointed to the item that you wanted the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.010 
pointed to the item that you wanted the
link<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.090> open<00:04:22.180> up<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:24.910> had

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
link to open up we then had

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.860 
link to open up we then had
the<00:04:26.139> content<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.069> became<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:28.030> actual<00:04:28.569> link

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
the content that became the actual link

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.900 
the content that became the actual link
in<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.860> case<00:04:30.069> of<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.520> our<00:04:30.639> previous

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
in the case of all of our previous

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.430 
in the case of all of our previous
examples<00:04:31.780> they<00:04:31.960> were<00:04:32.020> pieces<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:33.030> text<00:04:34.030> and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
examples they were pieces of text and

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.820 
examples they were pieces of text and
then<00:04:35.440> we<00:04:35.530> have<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> closing<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.310> tag<00:04:36.580> if<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:38.560> want

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
then we have a closing a tag if you want

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.409 
then we have a closing a tag if you want
