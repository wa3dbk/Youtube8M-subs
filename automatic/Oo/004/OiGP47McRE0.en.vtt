00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone jose antonio says hello what 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.770
 my name is josÃ© i'm from nicaragua good 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 I have an aquarium of 75 liters of water what 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.590
 which I only feel 55 liters of water 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 for my apple snail I have 12 zebras 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 5 sword 5 cookies all small as 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 of 5 centimeters each I have also 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960
 a lion head a golfer an angel 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 a koi and a telescope all of them from a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 medium size I'm eating once a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 day I am flakes and also balls of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 shrimp that are the most common that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 they sell in my country because what happens is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 the water becomes very cloudy 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.200
 quickly and I have to be changing 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.059
 from 3 to 4 days the water I can do to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 I have a filter of 60 liters of water per 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.250
 time equal to this that I do tell me in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 actually you have an overpopulation and for 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.460
 that soiled the water the only 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 solution is to find another bigger place 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 for coi and golf is another place to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.670
 the scalar and another for the telescope that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.649
 they are very delicate about zebras 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 and the bukis can give you problems 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 together I would stay only with the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 apple snail and the bukis and tovar and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 would give a radical change besides the type 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.700
 of internal filter that you have 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 and it would be better to put another filter more 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.780
 powerful or if possible a filter 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 outside either basket or 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 waterfall jerry box says hello jose are 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 some pictures of my aquarium of 190 liters 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.439
 it is said well the account hehehehe 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 fish you recommend you have substrate the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.149
 lamps are spotlights of 5 of 6000 here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 has a 540 liter waterfall filter 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.590
 now and at the moment is in cycled 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 of fish I recommend exposing and if you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.190
 it takes something I'm thinking about putting 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.170
 one power head with filter from the other 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.780
 side would be fine or another filter 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 waterfall everything depends on the ph and gh that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.369
 have your water roughly there are three 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 types of water the soft medium and the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 hard and the type of water can 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.759
 choose certain fish to live 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.619
 much more time and more healthily inside 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.289
 of this in the soft waters you can put 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 scalars neons others t after others 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.280
 even setter sometimes not too much 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.009
 difficult in middle waters some of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.869
 previous the grammys et cetera and in 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.600
 hard waters some you back and for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.880
 decided as the siphon ros mol and the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 bukis and so on and then cichlid fish 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.660
 that are suitable for these waters 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 about the filter I would tell you not to put 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.390
 another at the moment 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.550
 what you have seems to be enough but 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 over time if you lose power like 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.940
 well you say you could put a filter 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 interior or an exterior but this already 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 it will not matter since you have the filter 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.020
 principal santi alvarez says hello that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.120
 such 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
 I've got some rosemary logs that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.540
 I do not know if they go well for the aquarium that does not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 I have boiled it I put it in the container 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590
 submerged in water with a stone to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 it sinks that I'm changing the water 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 every two days and that once a week 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.680
 I put it to boil and I clean it when 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 I change the water I do not know if I am 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.520
 doing well but every time it costs 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.890
 less sink I hope it does not rot and 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.660
 serve for it tell me how are you here 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 a photo thank you for your videos 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.980
 as I said in the video of all the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.900
 trunks for aquariums rosemary can be 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.160
 perfectly use the process such and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 How are you doing? 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.880
 perfectly although you can also 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.260
 add to do a brushing on each 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.150
 change of water so that it is losing 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.860
 more dirt has a very nice color and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.530
 we hope to in the future when 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.960
 put see pictures of deivid's water 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 says hello this Monday my aunt gave me a gift 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.830
 Betta fish for my birthday I had a good time 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.720
 investigating about it I discovered that it is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.520
 good female the thing is that I realized 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.260
 that in his right eye has something like 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.080
 orange in the middle of the eye upwards 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.330
 what is it is a mushroom or something with what 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.010
 tried also this morning before I left 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.930
 to high school I realized that water 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.420
 it has like a super fine powder coat 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.310
 it's bad or good I also just noticed 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 that is swimming a lot along the banks and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.330
 approaching the walls of the fish tank 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.850
 It's a typical little ball-shaped 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.950
 as a half liter the fish tank will walk like this 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.440
 for a parasite I am new to fish 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.930
 I only had one kid and he had 18 children and he 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.670
 committed suicide I give you beta bit of eating and there 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.800
 bubbles on the edges of the fish tank in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.720
 the surface of the water thank you is the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.310
 first time I write you as not 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.720
 we know a lot about every neighborhood you start 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.440
 record of 100 t that the best would be 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 start 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.030
 Water changes of 30% each week and 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.950
 if you're not used to making them 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.590
 It would be better to do for several weeks 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.960
 Water changes from 40 to 50 percent 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.720
 that always being careful that it is not 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.400
 suddenly so that the fish do not suffer 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.590
 lack of this care could be 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.390
 linked to the eye problem or also 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.340
 It can be from blows or fights too 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.470
 you could apply some conditioner 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.910
 water or Indian almond leaves though 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.070
 It is true that they will cost you something more 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.540
 face that food that powder in 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.060
 the water surface of aquariums 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.860
 it's usually because the closet is new or 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.390
 by the water outlet of the filter in the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 first case the solution would be very 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.290
 simple and simply the changes of 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.390
 water that they are making you can go 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.580
 removing water from the surface and you're 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.620
 in principle this is not bad if it is for 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.600
 that is, I would not take away too much 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.640
 fish tanks balls are bad for 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.890
 fish by the way they have and it's a lot 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.690
 better a rectangular aquarium if you said 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.340
 that you have a beta female but you see 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.530
 bubbles on the surface of the aquarium 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.900
 you should look to see if it is a male goal 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.670
 of the plate variety these are very 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.470
 similar to the females of the beta 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.780
 normal splendid 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.249
 eduardo says hello jose I tell you I have 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.289
 a tree and marc moore sick 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.969
 moves and is always at the bottom of 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.369
 occasionally it rises but can not swim 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.289
 by itself it remains floating that I can 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.209
 do when the moli begin to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.709
 waver as well as these problems what 

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:16.899
 we can do is put that part of the 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:18.939
 aquarium in some container and apply them 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.409
 green of malachite or methylene blue or 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.239
 some other variant of others 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.979
 similar medicines because the truth 

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.719
 is that they are not concrete symptoms either 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.279
 to treat them I have already seen in these 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.989
 problems in some of my videos with 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.879
 my fish that have sometimes been 

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:32.019
 saved and others do not also have to be said 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.389
 that although moles are fish 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:36.429
 supposedly easy there are sometimes 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.379
 where they are not comfortable in some 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:40.239
 types of water and begin to make sea ââand 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.129
 they die the truth experienced with 

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.599
 some aquariums with salt and others without 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.249
 she and she has not noticed a great 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.079
 difference but of course this is going to 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.029
 depend on the hatcheries where they come 

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:50.499
 those moles in theory in nature if 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.019
 are used to having changes in 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.519
 water freshwater and brackish water 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.379
 that the truth would not dare me either 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.729
 say much more in situations like this 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.169
 The best we can do is to do 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.819
 abundant water changes so that 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.709
 have a lot of quality and give them the best 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.019
 possible feeding of the best quality 

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:06.489
 although we do not save these fish if 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:08.379
 we can save those who come behind 

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:10.140
 that are in your situation this let's say 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.070
 is one of the best 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.600
 when we have finished but you 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.230
 I remember that you have me in the channel 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.300
 video game 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.300
 jose tronic 2 more 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.199
 and on my guitar solo guitar channel 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.810
 I hope you like it a lot and if not then 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.460
 nothing happens
