until<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.199> find<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.740> maybe<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.340> could

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
until we find out maybe that they could

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
until we find out maybe that they could
change<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.750> could<00:00:30.990> still<00:00:31.199> change<00:00:31.439> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
change because it could still change so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860 
change because it could still change so
the<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:32.610> change<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> list<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.570> beast

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
hunters pet so that's actually really

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.240 
hunters pet so that's actually really
cool<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.260> hunter<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.829> pet<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
cool if your hunter if your pet is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
cool if your hunter if your pet is
behind<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.940> pillar<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.170> you're<00:00:43.320> blowing<00:00:43.649> up

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
behind a pillar and so you're blowing up

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.360 
behind a pillar and so you're blowing up
a<00:00:44.120> rogue<00:00:45.559> you'll<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.680> able<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.100> beast

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
a rogue you'll be able to use beast

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.680 
a rogue you'll be able to use beast
you'll<00:00:47.579> ramp<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> won't<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> see

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you'll ramp then you won't have to see

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
you'll ramp then you won't have to see
your<00:00:48.960> actual<00:00:49.289> pet<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> buff

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
your actual pet so that's that's a buff

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.569 
your actual pet so that's that's a buff
I<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.379> silencing<00:00:52.379> shot<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.829> has<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> 24

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
I would say silencing shot now has a 24

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
I would say silencing shot now has a 24
second<00:00:53.969> cooldown<00:00:54.149> most<00:00:54.600> 20<00:00:54.930> seconds<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
second cooldown most 20 seconds that's a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
second cooldown most 20 seconds that's a
nerve<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.399> four<00:00:56.789> seconds<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> really

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
nerve but it's four seconds it's really

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
nerve but it's four seconds it's really
not<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.899> big<00:00:58.260> deal<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.949> mean<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> nerve

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
not that big deal I mean it is a nerve

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.130 
not that big deal I mean it is a nerve
but<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.170> could<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> heck<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.190> worse

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
but it could be a heck of a lot worse

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
but it could be a heck of a lot worse
finding<00:01:04.140> shot<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.650> longer<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> focused

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
finding shot no longer has a focused

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.510 
finding shot no longer has a focused
cost<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:07.320> sweet<00:01:07.590> where

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
cost which is pretty pretty sweet where

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
cost which is pretty pretty sweet where
Vince<00:01:08.760> team<00:01:09.060> no<00:01:09.570> longer<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:10.049> focused<00:01:10.439> cost

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
Vince team no longer has focused cost

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
Vince team no longer has focused cost
and<00:01:10.979> its<00:01:11.100> cooldown<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.850> 45<00:01:12.330> seconds<00:01:12.869> which

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and its cooldown is now 45 seconds which

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
and its cooldown is now 45 seconds which
was<00:01:13.290> 60<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.460> pretty<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
was 60 so that's a pretty good but for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
was 60 so that's a pretty good but for
that<00:01:15.299> glyph<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> Mark<00:01:16.740> death<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.460> been

hunter for five percent of maximum

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so I can see a lot of hunters kind of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.500 
so I can see a lot of hunters kind of
being<00:01:36.360> excited<00:01:37.050> for<00:01:37.320> these<00:01:37.409> changes<00:01:38.510> pretty

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
being excited for these changes pretty

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.120 
being excited for these changes pretty
sure<00:01:39.780> they're<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.050> lot<00:01:40.229> happier<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.950> these

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

changes<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.140> most<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.350> classes<00:01:43.830> are<00:01:43.950> with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
changes then most other classes are with

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.400 
changes then most other classes are with
theirs<00:01:44.370> because<00:01:44.720> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.900> classes<00:01:46.320> are

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
theirs because kind of the classes are

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.770 
theirs because kind of the classes are
just<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.800> over<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.340> place<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.300> no
