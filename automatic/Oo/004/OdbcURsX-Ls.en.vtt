00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
go into a restaurant here in town and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710 
go into a restaurant here in town and
walk<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> pretty<00:00:17.970> much<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.270> everybody

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
walk in and pretty much know everybody

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.189 
walk in and pretty much know everybody
that's<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.080> there<00:00:20.539> at<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> smaller<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> town

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that's in there at the smaller the town

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.810 
that's in there at the smaller the town
I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.619> larger<00:00:22.890> impact<00:00:23.189> high<00:00:23.609> school

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I think the larger impact high school

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.400 
I think the larger impact high school
football<00:00:23.970> tends<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> community

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
football tends to have on the community

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
football tends to have on the community
because<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.039> guess<00:00:26.880> everybody<00:00:27.300> sees<00:00:27.539> these

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
because I guess everybody sees these

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.150 
because I guess everybody sees these
kids<00:00:27.930> grow<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.140> from<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.500> young<00:00:28.650> age<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> they

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
kids grow up from a young age and they

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
kids grow up from a young age and they

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
follow him from youth football up to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.240 
follow him from youth football up to
middle<00:00:31.380> school<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.920> him<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.130> high

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
school and they watch their progression

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.670 
school and they watch their progression
they<00:00:33.870> tend<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> deeper<00:00:34.530> connection

they tend to have a deeper connection

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.750
