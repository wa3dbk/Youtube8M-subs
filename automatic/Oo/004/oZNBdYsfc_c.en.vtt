hard thing for many people but it was
harder<00:01:59.930> still<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.619> think<00:02:00.860> about<00:02:01.189> what<00:02:01.549> would

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
harder still to think about what would

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.550

have happened to those pensions if we

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.060 
have happened to those pensions if we
didn't<00:02:03.799> save<00:02:04.070> them<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.600> did<00:02:05.810> by<00:02:06.619> coming

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
didn't save them so we did by coming
