00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 to your question what happens if you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.030
 enacts the seed law is not 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 promulgates 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.730
 it seems to me that basically it is not a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 indispensable thing that this is needed 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 of all the research that today is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 is doing is not with a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.470
 look at a type of agriculture that does not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.800
 is convenient neither for the country nor for 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.559
 the producers nor for the citizens 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.660
 because the kind of products that are being 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.900
 generating with that seed is not a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.520
 food that brings us health is a 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.300
 food 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 and it's a type of agriculture that like 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.100
 we are seeing what is propitiating 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.840
 is the most intensive use of homicides 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.750
 insecticide out there when I say 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.460
 insecticides I happen to say no but 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.039
 a transgenic corn bt a soy vet 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.619
 takes less insecticide if you're right 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.170
 It has less insecticide but it has a 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.439
 gene that is generating a principle 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.360
 active that will be in the plant that 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.319
 it's going to be in the grain that we're going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.579
 be consuming an active principle of 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:40.939
 one of a of a being that is not of our 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.520
 genome and that starts to transfigure us 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.640
 evolutionarily it means that we 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.950
 can cause derangements but if that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.250
 gene that generates a substance that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.000
 controls lepidoptera and undermines 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 happens when that plant falls on the ground 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.120
 that in the biological cycle of formulation 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.940
 of soil formation that is the foundation 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.860
 to produce if we do not let go flooded 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.450
 from the beginning active what will happen 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 with that food chain what's going to happen 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.710
 with the stubble 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.360
 then what we are seeing 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.430
 that kind of transgenic seed 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.880
 the producer is helping because 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.310
 is helping to get into debt so that each 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.459
 instead use more chemical than each 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 he gets intoxicated more because he's surrounded 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.560
 your sheds your vans your machines 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.530
 of products that constantly have 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 to be avoiding them because he knows that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.180
 are pollutants are pollutants for 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.790
 the means to the health of its people for 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.340
 all because we can not control the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.350
 application as they say the good 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.210
 practices could mitigate that effect not 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.910
 what we have to think 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.730
 and I was in the case of having to 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.660
 think about a network there would not be that kind of 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.210
 agriculture that we think 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.100
 we use a health agriculture a 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:12.220
 agriculture where the processes point to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.670
 network establish the biological processes 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.780
 do not degrade the resources get higher 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.010
 production efficiency maybe before 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.180
 it seemed to us when that is when it 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.880
 incorporated the best agricultural machinery 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.680
 first inputs a great response and a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.650
 production increase but that's 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.600
 person today that stabilized and what 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.970
 we are seeing producing 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.840
 ecologically we are in the same 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.140
 production levels at very high levels 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 high production and with much costs 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.860
 lower and without deteriorating resources 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 with minimum level of contamination 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.850
 so today you do not need to patent that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.510
 seed give him the authorization so that 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.580
 start 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 to tempt and become owner of species 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.950
 digital that correspond to all of us 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.200
 all and that because one intervenes in a 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.750
 genome and put the gene from another side 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.049
 believe that he is the owner of that species not 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.269
 there is almost no transgenic that 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.310
 change the production look that comes out 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.620
 of this quagmire that we have that is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.250
 more use of agrochemicals more 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.800
 pollution little care resources 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.949
 inefficiency inefficiency because it is not 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.320
 that is being produced efficiently 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.330
 it is happening even more than very bad 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.790
 quality that would have to be discussed that or 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.220
 be more quantity 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.830
 with a lot more cost therefore it 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.450
 is much more inefficient than what 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.410
 we are doing in a way 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.290
 careful and thoughtful natural 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.870
 agroecological principles we are not 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.110
 talking about the abandonment of letting go of what 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.960
 from before 60's techniques we're not 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.300
 talking about principles that can give 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.420
 solution to any producer in the country 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.240
 it is not necessary to put laws so that 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.250
 investigate more so that you think if the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.980
 98 percent of all research 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.260
 of all our last 50 years out 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.730
 an address is very difficult that 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.190
 let's have solutions for the whole country 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.160
 I think we should make an effort 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.170
 for that kind of research the 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.630
 State institutions have to be 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.850
 investigating in that not so much trying 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.360
 these transgenics that are for greater 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.770
 use of herbicides greater use 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.800
 and always try to kill the other 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.889
 to strengthen and favor processes of 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.560
 scale high capital processes that 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.199
 they stay with our lands we do not 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.289
 we are realizing that this process of 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.389
 Sojization of monoculture is leaving 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.819
 side our producers and that 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.520
 when someday transgenic soy does not 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:01.520
 have value we will not have people in the 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.699
 field that we're going to do and that's a 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.949
 depopulation in turn with a low 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.270
 We will not recover fertility in 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.460
 few years we will have to invest 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.310
 everything that went to the boats around 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.690
 client who left that is not a country 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.880
 of development that cloud in the 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.210
 biotechnology that needs loans 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.090
 another model and I think that agroecology 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.330
 can offer is a heresy is in the 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.389
 faculties is a science we are not 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.419
 talking about weird magic things 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.150
 then let's get out of this paradigm 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:39.530
 predominant that will take us to a 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.069
 greater poverty to a greater need for 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.719
 remedies because we're going to be all 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:48.139
 intoxicated with health problems like 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:50.389
 is going severe we have to see them 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.750
 and we do not want to see every one that 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.750
 just
