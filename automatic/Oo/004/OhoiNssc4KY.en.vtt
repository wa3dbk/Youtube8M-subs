00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
natural food in a way that we don't

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.949 
natural food in a way that we don't
really<00:02:01.219> understand<00:02:01.669> yet<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.389> why<00:02:02.929> a

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
really understand yet and this is why a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.839 
really understand yet and this is why a
lot<00:02:03.139> of<00:02:03.380> vitamins<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.979> are<00:02:04.099> synthesized<00:02:04.609> can

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
lot of vitamins that are synthesized can

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.489 
lot of vitamins that are synthesized can
present<00:02:05.419> problems<00:02:05.450> as<00:02:05.929> against<00:02:06.169> the<00:02:06.319> natural

alternatives<00:02:07.219> when<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:07.880> look<00:02:07.999> at<00:02:08.090> garlic

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
alternatives when we look at garlic

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.630 
alternatives when we look at garlic
there<00:02:08.720> we're<00:02:09.110> seeing<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.410> natural<00:02:09.890> substance

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there we're seeing a natural substance

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
there we're seeing a natural substance
where<00:02:10.910> we<00:02:11.030> take<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.390> extract<00:02:11.810> out<00:02:11.989> you're

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
where we take the extract out you're

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.949 
where we take the extract out you're
saying<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:13.220> we're<00:02:13.400> using<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.150> many<00:02:14.690> many

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
saying and we're using that in many many

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.750 
saying and we're using that in many many
times<00:02:15.319> more<00:02:15.470> potency<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.520> would<00:02:16.640> ever

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
times more potency that you would ever

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
times more potency that you would ever
get<00:02:16.970> away<00:02:17.210> with<00:02:17.420> eating<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.900> garlic<00:02:18.320> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
get away with eating the garlic and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.370 
get away with eating the garlic and
keeping<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.800> marriage

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
keeping a marriage

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.980 
keeping a marriage
sure<00:02:19.770> well<00:02:20.340> Alison<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:21.480> not<00:02:21.630> found

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
sure well Alison is actually not found

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.590 
sure well Alison is actually not found
in<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.260> garlic<00:02:22.650> clove<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.580> only<00:02:23.850> produced

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
in a garlic clove it's only produced

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.660 
in a garlic clove it's only produced
when<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.020> garlic<00:02:25.440> clove<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.920> cut<00:02:26.250> crushed

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
when that garlic clove is cut crushed

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
when that garlic clove is cut crushed
root<00:02:27.060> chopped<00:02:27.900> stir-fried<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.770> whatever

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
root chopped stir-fried or whatever

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
root chopped stir-fried or whatever
processed<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.510> garlic's<00:02:31.050> natural

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
processed so it's garlic's natural

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
processed so it's garlic's natural
defense<00:02:31.860> mechanism<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.700> only<00:02:32.850> ever

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
defense mechanism so it's only ever

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.180 
defense mechanism so it's only ever
needed<00:02:33.600> when<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> garlic<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.980> being

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
needed when when the garlic is being

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.250 
needed when when the garlic is being
attacked<00:02:35.520> by<00:02:35.760> something<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.660> Alison<00:02:37.140> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
attacked by something and that Alison is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080 
attacked by something and that Alison is
very<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.800> unstable<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.730> soon<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:38.970> you've

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
very very unstable so as soon as you've

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.450 
very very unstable so as soon as you've
made<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:40.200> changing<00:02:40.800> into<00:02:41.010> lots<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.280> other

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
made it it's changing into lots of other

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.120 
made it it's changing into lots of other
chemicals<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.260> disappearing<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.860> what

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
chemicals and disappearing now what

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.590 
chemicals and disappearing now what
we've<00:02:44.370> been<00:02:44.520> involved<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> last<00:02:45.300> six

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
we've been involved with in the last six

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.050 
we've been involved with in the last six
or<00:02:45.690> seven<00:02:45.750> years<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.710> process<00:02:47.340> whereby<00:02:47.610> we

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
or seven years is a process whereby we

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.230 
or seven years is a process whereby we
can<00:02:48.180> actually<00:02:48.360> capture<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.290> Alison

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
can actually capture this Alison

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.700 
can actually capture this Alison
stabilize<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.570> by<00:02:51.750> diluting<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.590> with

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
stabilize it by diluting it with

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.190 
stabilize it by diluting it with
ordinary<00:02:53.040> water<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:54.510> means<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.870> end<00:02:55.020> up

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
ordinary water and that means we end up

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.950 
ordinary water and that means we end up
with<00:02:55.350> an<00:02:55.470> extract<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.070> real<00:02:56.430> Alison<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.780> has

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
with an extract of real Alison that has

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.870 
with an extract of real Alison that has
the<00:02:58.110> most<00:02:58.230> doesn't<00:02:58.650> occur<00:02:58.950> exactly<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.790> it

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the most doesn't occur exactly and it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.550 
the most doesn't occur exactly and it
has<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> most<00:03:00.240> amazing<00:03:00.560> biological

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
has the most amazing biological

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.410 
has the most amazing biological
properties<00:03:01.980> which<00:03:02.610> we've<00:03:02.850> been<00:03:03.030> researching

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
properties which we've been researching

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.570 
properties which we've been researching
over<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.930> past<00:03:04.140> six<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.500> seven<00:03:04.800> years<00:03:04.950> does<00:03:05.550> it

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
over the past six or seven years does it

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.460 
over the past six or seven years does it
stink<00:03:05.910> as<00:03:06.060> badly<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.510> does<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.900> mean<00:03:07.020> if<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.290> if

available<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.350> body<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.860> they're<00:03:47.010> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
available to the body so they're just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.070

resistant<00:04:24.030> infections<00:04:24.570> my<00:04:25.110> question<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.590> why

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
resistant infections my question is why

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.200 
resistant infections my question is why
would<00:04:26.100> they<00:04:26.220> not<00:04:26.430> use<00:04:26.640> something<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.090> this

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
would they not use something like this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.480 
would they not use something like this
well<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.690> think<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.710> problem<00:04:28.890> here<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.340> this

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
well I think the problem here is this

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.659 
well I think the problem here is this
the<00:04:29.669> medicines<00:04:30.060> health<00:04:30.240> care

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669

and<00:04:35.020> herbal<00:04:36.009> treatments<00:04:36.460> now<00:04:36.639> apparently<00:04:37.150> can

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
and herbal treatments now apparently can

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.899 
and herbal treatments now apparently can
get<00:04:37.629> licensed<00:04:38.199> but<00:04:38.560> they<00:04:39.400> have<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.759> go<00:04:39.879> through

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
get licensed but they have to go through
