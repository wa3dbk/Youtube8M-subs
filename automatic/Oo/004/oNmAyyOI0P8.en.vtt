00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
grass next to another species you guys

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.490 
grass next to another species you guys
four<00:03:46.290> butterflies<00:03:47.840> lay<00:03:48.840> their<00:03:49.019> eggs<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.410> then

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
four butterflies lay their eggs and then

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.410 
four butterflies lay their eggs and then
they<00:03:50.340> hatch<00:03:50.519> out<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:50.970> eat<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.330> other

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
they hatch out and they eat the other

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.060 
they hatch out and they eat the other
grass<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.140> we<00:03:52.260> have<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.440> be<00:03:52.530> mindful<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.950> these

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
grass so we have to be mindful of these

grass so we have to be mindful of these
grasses<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.880> biologist<00:03:54.360> is<00:03:54.480> concerned

of the concerns of the biologists we're

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.440 
of the concerns of the biologists we're
not<00:04:05.890> broadcasting<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.670> boys<00:04:06.939> like<00:04:07.120> we<00:04:07.269> would

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
not broadcasting this boys like we would

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.580 
not broadcasting this boys like we would
normally<00:04:07.569> do<00:04:07.870> what<00:04:08.049> we're<00:04:08.200> doing<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.470> we're

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
normally do what we're doing is we're

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.690 
normally do what we're doing is we're
gathering<00:04:08.980> them<00:04:09.099> on<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.280> downhill<00:04:09.670> side

we<00:04:16.449> want<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.660> look<00:04:16.989> like<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.289> been<00:04:17.440> here

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
we want to look like it's been here

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.050 
we want to look like it's been here
three<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:17.949> four<00:04:18.190> years<00:04:18.400> if<00:04:18.519> not<00:04:18.639> even<00:04:18.789> more

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
three or four years if not even more

than<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.329> when<00:04:19.870> we're<00:04:20.019> done<00:04:20.139> building<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.829> so

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
than that when we're done building it so

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.710 
than that when we're done building it so
the<00:04:21.639> first<00:04:21.820> step<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.150> Machine<00:04:22.389> once<00:04:22.570> we

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
the first step of the Machine once we

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.840 
the first step of the Machine once we
expose<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.710> volunteers<00:04:24.190> will<00:04:24.490> come<00:04:24.669> back

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
expose it the volunteers will come back

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.760 
expose it the volunteers will come back
and<00:04:25.419> they<00:04:25.539> will<00:04:25.660> clean<00:04:25.900> up<00:04:25.930> what<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.560> call<00:04:26.680> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
and they will clean up what we call the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.050 
and they will clean up what we call the
bench<00:04:26.949> cut<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.310> surface<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.789> tread

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
bench cut the surface to the tread

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.210 
bench cut the surface to the tread
surface<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.710> they'll<00:04:29.710> smooth<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.130> out

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
surface and they'll smooth it out

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.439 
surface and they'll smooth it out
they'll<00:04:30.580> create<00:04:30.820> what's<00:04:31.030> called<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.270> back

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
they'll create what's called a back

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.180 
they'll create what's called a back
slope<00:04:31.780> which<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.229> where<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.530> water<00:04:32.680> comes<00:04:32.979> off

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
slope which is where the water comes off

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.670 
slope which is where the water comes off
of<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:33.580> hill<00:04:34.180> into<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.720> tread<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.199> then

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
of this hill into the tread and then

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.980 
of this hill into the tread and then
they'll<00:04:35.800> broadcast<00:04:35.949> the<00:04:36.340> Spoils<00:04:36.729> away<00:04:37.660> and

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
they'll broadcast the Spoils away and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.050 
they'll broadcast the Spoils away and
then<00:04:38.380> you'll<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.800> nice<00:04:39.100> natural

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
then you'll have this nice natural

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.450 
then you'll have this nice natural
man-made<00:04:40.780> but<00:04:41.199> natural<00:04:41.650> looking<00:04:41.860> bench<00:04:42.100> on

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
man-made but natural looking bench on

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
hard part you know these guys work their

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.540 
hard part you know these guys work their
butts<00:05:14.110> off<00:05:14.260> out<00:05:14.500> there<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.949> construction

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
butts off out there in the construction

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.520 
butts off out there in the construction
but<00:05:15.760> just<00:05:16.330> getting<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.720> okay<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:17.139> go<00:05:17.380> ahead

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
but just getting the okay to go ahead

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.029 
but just getting the okay to go ahead
and<00:05:17.770> do<00:05:17.860> this<00:05:18.039> stuff<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.659> becoming<00:05:19.979> more<00:05:20.979> and

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
and do this stuff is becoming more and

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.980 
and do this stuff is becoming more and
more<00:05:21.220> challenging<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.539> think<00:05:22.750> with<00:05:22.870> this

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
more challenging and I think with this

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.390 
more challenging and I think with this
little<00:05:23.289> scraggy<00:05:23.620> trail<00:05:24.520> that's<00:05:24.789> gonna<00:05:24.970> be<00:05:25.240> our

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
little scraggy trail that's gonna be our

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.920 
little scraggy trail that's gonna be our
our<00:05:27.400> crown<00:05:27.729> jewel<00:05:27.760> out<00:05:28.240> there<00:05:28.510> if<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.750> will

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
our crown jewel out there if you will
