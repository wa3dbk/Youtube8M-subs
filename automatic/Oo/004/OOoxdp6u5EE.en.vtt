00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.109 
in what I guess is a good thing I didn't
hit<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> ball<00:01:09.159> because<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.579> feel<00:01:09.759> like<00:01:09.909> if<00:01:10.030> I

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
hit the ball because I feel like if I

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.090 
hit the ball because I feel like if I
had<00:01:10.299> it<00:01:10.450> once<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.960> replay<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.649> might<00:01:11.920> go
