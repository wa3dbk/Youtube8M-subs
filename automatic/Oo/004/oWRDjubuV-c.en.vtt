00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello everyone i 'm elias 360 and i 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.129
 I bring this no video and this time gameplay 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 commented on 'infamous' second show is 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.320
 a game that was already put on sale yesterday 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.700
 if I'm not wrong in some 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.040
 establishments but good the date 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.780
 departure officer is today so nothing 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.129
 as angels has bought the game has 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.810
 let play the first half hour 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.400
 approximately and I've picked up a couple of 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.410
 highlights that is to say the best parts 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.480
 it's also saying that I probably 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 you are listening, then, better in 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 principle should listen to me better and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.119
 I 'm with the angel microphone and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.250
 you know how good it is of these 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.509
 table so nothing really the gameplay 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.430
 it's secondary 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320
 that with are secondary good and I have 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.989
 a spark more than a fucking lighter but 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.489
 well as he keeps saying it's pretty 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.070
 secondary but I wanted to give an example 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.450
 then current and that more current than 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.399
 what I just played because that same 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.829
 half an hour ago I assembled it immediately and 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.020
 I'm commenting on what I want 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.460
 comment is something that I said yesterday in the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.989
 main channel in the video the channel 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.820
 Main already know that I uploaded those that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.129
 you subscribed to that channel a video of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.960
 gta 5 with angel with josemi with by is what 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.129
 typical and at the end of the video I said 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.500
 that we were going to make a stay in 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.149
 valencia taking advantage that I'm here 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.920
 although I have come to see angel I come 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.850
 from Alicante I was with already here 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.729
 I will upload a blog also on this channel 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.200
 where you already know crazy plans 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.610
 So, I came from Alicante 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.439
 to Valencia to spend a few days with 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 angel and we have decided to make a 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.619
 stayed since we do not usually do many 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.330
 in fact angel has only made one left 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.610
 from here they will take advantage and make 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
 another one remains so I do not repeat anything because 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.000
 I know there are many people who are 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.630
 subscribed to this channel and the channel 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.070
 principal 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.409
 but although it may seem like a lie 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.299
 because I already realized at the time 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.590
 Well, there are people who are only subscribed to 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.539
 this channel because he likes the most 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.979
 content or whatever so because 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.170
 there were also many more videos 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.259
 It is also true so nothing I repeat 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.270
 day 22 which is tomorrow is Saturday we will be 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.819
 in the north station of valencia la 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.990
 train station go and good me 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.549
 it seems that there is only one northern station 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 so in principle there should not be 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.020
 no complication but good season 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.110
 north of valencia and we will be starting 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.369
 of the five principles let's hope not 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.500
 delay not without nothing you know what angel 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.909
 live in the putt that is a town that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 it's pretty close to valencia so 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.019
 in principle there should not be any 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.090
 problem but good at 5 we will be 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.920
 there and I imagine that we will be two 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.640
 hours or three I do not know depending on the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.110
 people who come 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.150
 you know what is usually done 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.800
 stayed many times you ask us what 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.709
 we are going to do in the hangout because I do not know 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.450
 what to distribute pots and plant geraniums 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.640
 well, you know what you do 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 the hangouts so nothing depending on 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
 the people that go we will try good of 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.850
 we will attend to all the people who 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.350
 go so nothing and we wait for you 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.560
 take photos to talk to you 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.650
 whatever else I have to say to you if 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.780
 I went to Valencia to record those that did not 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.690
 you know to record with jackie of the channel 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.570
 sorry forgiveness and well we went to 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 record a theme the league of legends that 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.070
 You already know that in a video with him 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.050
 I said if we reached 30,000 likes we recorded 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.370
 rap and we make the video clip in 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.260
 beginning the video did not reach 30,000 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.910
 likes I think it stayed at 25,000 or something 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.470
 for the style but we have recorded 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.690
 the subject and I imagine that we will also do 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.980
 the video clip I do not know when he's already 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 will upload it is something that you are going to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.890
 see on your channel but on my channel in this 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.750
 channel in fact in the secondary channel 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.790
 you're going to see the making off so to speak 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.060
 blog roll also how are we going to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.200
 study and so on and so like what 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.220
 we record although the truth is that it costs 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.590
 enough I had never recorded 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.360
 songs you already know that I sing then the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.980
 sweet title and little more 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.690
 and well, the typical concerts that 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.950
 they do not shower but the truth is 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.480
 that was a good experience already 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.250
 you will see it has been pretty cool the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.960
 truth above all I who know for my part 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.640
 to be the first time I think that the 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.230
 result is pretty good I 'll go 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.260
 improving over time I imagine that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.180
 we will record more more videos of this 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.580
 kind but good nothing little more this 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.350
 video was basically for you to see the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.330
 imei mousse de consol although it is 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.920
 pretty cool the truth is sometimes noticed 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.810
 a little the fall of frames but yes that 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.340
 it is true that the subject of particles is 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.950
 quite accomplished so nothing here what 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.020
 you have background if you want to buy 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.030
 angel this time has been purchased in format 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.360
 digital has cost 60 euros from 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.310
 from the playstation network from the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.630
 which we have been give the east bazaar 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.790
 playstation that right now I do not get 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.110
 the playstation store so nothing of me 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.180
 I imagine that in physical format too 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.400
 will be for that price that you already know 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.660
 the physical and digital format they put the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.459
 same price does not make much sense but 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.140
 good is what there is so nothing I hope 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.790
 that you liked already you know lake and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.950
 favorites see you tomorrow at the hangout 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.200
 of courage and with nothing more to say 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.450
 say goodbye 360 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.450
 until the next the best of three 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.760
 A) Yes 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.070
 that is all
