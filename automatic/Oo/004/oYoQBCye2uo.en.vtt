 of iÃ±igo cortes and imanol alguacil 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 coaches of the first youth team and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 respectively, and they have put 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 hands to work in the first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.730
 pre-season training yes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.940
 you win if sure we body technicians 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 and players I suppose and I hope that also 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.320
 six weeks of work 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.880
 in the middle we will have about six friendlies and 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.590
 well as always at the beginning of 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 season in the preseason 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 the workload is the most important thing 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.860
 everything is important while being where 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.310
 we are for what we are good that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.320
 the players are the best possible 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.750
 so that tomorrow then 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.509
 are closer to what is the maximum 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.450
 level is always nice to win insurance 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.509
 because you have a prize above 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.250
 short term but here we are more 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.229
 looking at the long term not too much 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.759
 long term but yes looking at the first 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.950
 team and the most important thing is that when 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.659
 spend a few years of this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.119
 generation then know how many 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 stabilize in the first level that I 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.890
 it seems to me the most important thing and for that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 Well, we have a job to do in addition 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.729
 with this kind of weather so good 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.229
 It still gets harder but good with the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.939
 illusion that with which come the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.560
 kids, well, it's always more 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.450
 bearable no but good I imagine that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.019
 they will come with much desire and with illusion 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.460
 yes it is clear that the jump is hard is not 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:19.190
 difficult and good 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.470
 a little bit of all the years people from 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.510
 first year that competes against the people 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.610
 already very made of even the last year 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 so then good 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.290
 yes without forgetting a bit of what it is 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.180
 the good individual training we are going to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.240
 say if we are also capable of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.080
 compete and good and to play this acts 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 the teams
