 ANTRECESSIONARY GRAFFITY 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.000
 CHALK 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.980
 We have used a new tool, new technologies. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.220
 Street art artist Dscamoe Mr (DSC) 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.700
 for street art, drawing your team. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.960
 Street art artist Tony Stork (Rayons) 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.380
 We used chalk, forgotten by everybody and somehow not respected, 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.480
 but it's also an artistic tool to be used. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 Cool stuff! 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.740
 Why not? 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.600
 Cheap, people react absolutely positively. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.060
 You can draw almost everywhere. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.000
 Iâ€™ve been walking around. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.420
 So it's cool! 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
 People take it normally, nobody get what's going on. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.780
 So you can do without markers, go and tag ... by chalk! 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 The only negative is a limited range of colors, 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.620
 but we have not yet tested the coal. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.600
 But we will! 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.180
 The good thing is that you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 You can quickly get your artwork off. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
 That's all. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.760
 Gonna be the best. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.320
 So here's the way in crisis- it's chalk. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.980
 Fine! 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.440
