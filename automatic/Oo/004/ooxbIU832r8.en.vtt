00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

all<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:00.599> so<00:00:00.780> here<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:00.989> am<00:00:01.110> doing<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.770> window

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
all right so here I am doing my window

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right so here I am doing my window
regulator<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:04.609> because<00:00:05.609> it's<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.940> convertible

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
regulator and because it's a convertible

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.070 
regulator and because it's a convertible
it<00:00:06.750> has<00:00:06.960> no<00:00:07.259> top<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.280> can't<00:00:08.610> tape<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
it has no top here so you can't tape the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.789 
it has no top here so you can't tape the
window<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> did<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.759> used

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
window what I did was I used

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.840 
window what I did was I used
screwdrivers<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.809> hold<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> window<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.980> as

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
screwdrivers to hold the window and as

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.730 
screwdrivers to hold the window and as
you<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.660> screwdrivers<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.439> holding

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you can see the screwdrivers are holding

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.769 
you can see the screwdrivers are holding
the<00:00:19.830> window<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> beat<00:00:20.520> each<00:00:20.760> side<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.570> have

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the window on beat each side and I have

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
the window on beat each side and I have
a<00:00:21.810> safety<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.039> case<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.310> little

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a safety here just in case a little

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.470 
a safety here just in case a little
piece<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.910> wood

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
piece of wood

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.730 
piece of wood
now<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> regulator<00:00:26.820> came<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.420> real<00:00:28.289> easy

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
now the regulator came out real easy

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.759 
now the regulator came out real easy
from<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.820> side<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.420> pushed<00:00:30.810> over<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
from this side it pushed over here and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
from this side it pushed over here and
it<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.219> came<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.730> real<00:00:33.600> good<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.079> here

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it just came out real good right here

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
it just came out real good right here
all<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.890> screws<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.219> taken<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:37.430> was

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
all the screws are taken out I was

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.869 
all the screws are taken out I was
looking<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.360> prepreg<00:00:40.020> nated

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
looking for some prepreg nated

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.869 
looking for some prepreg nated
fiberglass<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.469> order<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.680> reinforce<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
fiberglass in order to reinforce some of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.340 
fiberglass in order to reinforce some of
these<00:00:45.710> drilled<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.860> points<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> didn't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
these drilled out points but I didn't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
these drilled out points but I didn't
find<00:00:49.559> any<00:00:49.829> prepreg<00:00:50.430> nated<00:00:50.760> fiberglass

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
find any prepreg nated fiberglass

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.619 
find any prepreg nated fiberglass
I<00:00:51.770> also<00:00:52.770> found<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> disconnected<00:00:54.360> wires

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I also found a lot of disconnected wires

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.630 
I also found a lot of disconnected wires
because<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> six<00:00:55.980> speaker<00:00:56.850> system<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
because I have a six speaker system and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
because I have a six speaker system and
somehow<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> process<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> unplugged<00:01:01.590> my

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
somehow in the process I unplugged my

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 
somehow in the process I unplugged my
tweeter<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.750> trying<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.019> figure<00:01:04.229> out

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
tweeter and I was trying to figure out

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.830 
tweeter and I was trying to figure out
what<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.860> wire<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.299> -<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.840> tweeter<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
what this wire was it's - my tweeter and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
what this wire was it's - my tweeter and
my<00:01:09.840> mid-range<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.040> tweeter<00:01:11.340> goes

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
my mid-range goes here my tweeter goes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.899 
my mid-range goes here my tweeter goes
here<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.200> wire<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:14.670> put

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
here and that was that wire now to put

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.620 
here and that was that wire now to put
it<00:01:15.030> back

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
it back

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.670 
it back
I<00:01:16.009> used<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.280> two<00:01:17.880> mill<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:20.990> got<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.170> plastic

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
I used a two mill I got some plastic

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920 
I used a two mill I got some plastic
from<00:01:22.860> Home<00:01:23.070> Depot<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
from Home Depot I was going to go with a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.740 
from Home Depot I was going to go with a
3.5<00:01:25.710> million<00:01:27.080> only<00:01:28.080> $3<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.430> three<00:01:30.329> point<00:01:30.540> five

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
3.5 million only $3 the three point five

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.950 
3.5 million only $3 the three point five
mil<00:01:31.280> runya<00:01:32.280> $8<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
mil runya $8 so I think I'm going to go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
mil runya $8 so I think I'm going to go
with<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.290> mil<00:01:34.560> I've<00:01:34.799> already<00:01:35.670> measured<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with two mil I've already measured it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
with two mil I've already measured it
out<00:01:36.680> did<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.950> cut<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> had<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.869> 48

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
out did one cut and it had you know 48

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.230 
out did one cut and it had you know 48
inches<00:01:41.430> by<00:01:41.729> 21<00:01:42.450> inches<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.159> cut<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> got

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
inches by 21 inches in one cut so I got

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.190 
inches by 21 inches in one cut so I got
two<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:46.369> ready<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
two of them ready to go and I'm going to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.490 
two of them ready to go and I'm going to
rebuild<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.780> connectors

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
rebuild the little the the connectors

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
rebuild the little the the connectors
now<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.790> plan<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> back

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
now that's how I plan to put it back

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929 
now that's how I plan to put it back
together<00:01:55.079> taking<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.579> take<00:01:56.790> out

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
together taking it out just take out

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.289 
together taking it out just take out
everything<00:01:57.240> pull<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.310> as<00:01:59.310> you<00:02:00.149> can

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
everything pull it out and as you can

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.810 
everything pull it out and as you can
see<00:02:00.659> I've<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.770> identical<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
see I've got an identical one on the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.749 
see I've got an identical one on the
other<00:02:02.939> side<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.740> makes<00:02:04.979> life<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.610> little

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
other side and it makes life a little

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
other side and it makes life a little
bit<00:02:05.969> easier<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.780> when<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> back

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
bit easier because when you put it back

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.609 
bit easier because when you put it back
in<00:02:07.890> you'll<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:09.030> where<00:02:09.270> exactly<00:02:09.989> everything

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
in you'll know where exactly everything

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.860 
in you'll know where exactly everything
goes

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
goes

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.190 
goes
so<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.800> should<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.879> pretty<00:02:14.150> easy<00:02:14.540> fix<00:02:14.720> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so it should be a pretty easy fix and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.449 
so it should be a pretty easy fix and
now<00:02:16.129> that<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.459> got<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:18.099> positions<00:02:19.099> and

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
now that I've got the positions and

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.160 
now that I've got the positions and
every<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:19.940> screws<00:02:20.450> over<00:02:20.810> there
