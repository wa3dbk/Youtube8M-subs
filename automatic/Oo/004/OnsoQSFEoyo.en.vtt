00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.170
 an application where people can 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.129
 upload books that they write themselves and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.479
 post them 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.979

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 song on the radio I always say is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.960
 technique well is this that I want to go and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 I always use YouTube to see it better 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 to see if your every day is useful 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.220
 which is a game in which you are giving the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020

 I got them to load them on Christmas day 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 because I was bored when I was alone 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.690
 family and the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.600
 you are a monigote you have to run 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.310
 a horrible stick monkey but it's 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.710
 pretty well the truth is I love it 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.390
 I'm super addicted to this but I 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.550
 I would say that the application that I use the most 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.270
 He spent the whole day in byn to mobile to 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.860
 if it is great and wallpaper 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 well here I have applications that do not 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.930
 use as password posts health tips 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.840
 and ibooks and wallpaper I have a 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.119
 nobody because nobody celebrated me texas amore 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 level is the truth is that I love him very much 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.440
 and now he trusts to teach the things that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.850
 I have this is the first case that is 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.190
 removed and I lost weight that to me 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.350
 love this was a half gave away a 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.630
 my friend is how I loved this 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.140
 funda is surmountable but it's left 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.760
 great phone esqueman superman 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.890
 and now Laura also has the same 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.910
 because I gave him an equal because I 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.920
 I bought in Canada that is I love this 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.390
 that is a pretty ugly case I lost 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.610
 the top part to the lesson 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.580
 a part of this one but it loads the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.040
 phone so it's pretty useful because 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.160
 you always see that it is loading then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.100
 you do not stay in battery is we did a 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 friend in school vision and the girl 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.870
 that he had to give me this gift 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 I found that my mother brought it 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.209
 what I love about this is that the little eyes 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.950
 they are helmets then you take them off and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.140
 listen to music and curl up here 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.519
 so then if you listen to a musician in 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.430
 any part of the first covers 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.220
 I bought him that is taught in Italy that 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.190
 I love it and the letters shine in the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.130
 darkness and this is the same but that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 put a clue that he gave me a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.709
 friend of mine for christmas amarista being 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.709
 I want this 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.180
 and I love that it's from the rolling 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.440
 stones do not take away the order we are 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.300
 press that the board mate a lot 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.560
 thank you I have it pretty worn 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.390
 because it's what I usually put on when 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
 I go to school so I do not like it in 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.740
 the pocket because it's one of my 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 favorite because as you can see it has a 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.000
 little ball and it 's a maze after playing 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.350
 with them sometimes when I have the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.690
 mobile without battery what I do is play 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.690
 with the cover and is what 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.860
 I really like it, it broke my last 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.650
 Once I was home and laure and I 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.720
 I stayed to sleep but well it does not happen 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 I also have a list that is ping that 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 I bought it a week ago so I 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.280
 I love it, I love all of them 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.390
 the mobile ways and I have a 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.000
 person with contras plans of mobile 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.630
 then there is this one that is one of my 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.610
 favorite that is from katy perry stuff that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.870

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.470
