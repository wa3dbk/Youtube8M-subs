00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.770
 all right 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.040
 hello friends like this I hope you are 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.529
 of the best and welcome to a new 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.529
 kraft video in which I bring you this 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.710
 wonderful motorcycle called center and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.930
 long and this mode is to help 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.760
 find then our men from 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 our world in survival bonuses will tell you 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.440
 now delayed version no character 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.449
 we have found them and those to take out of 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.309
 creative mode inventory and so on 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.960
 so on and so good for all 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.150
 we know it can be cheating with everyone 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.470
 the mods and you can also install a 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.680
 mod of weapons and you take them all from 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.050
 creative instead of striving 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.510
 and then that would not make sense in that 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 Major case would not make sense but good 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.540
 good is a way that is pretty 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 typical because we have very 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.290
 well done and he is swimming in what 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.600
 consists then this is for the people 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.600
 who wants to play in semi clean mode 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.780
 we do what we want but good 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.780
 point when you press the key or we will 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.630
 appear this article are very well 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.730
 designed it says very well the color of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 order then today you can see crisis 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.330
 center active 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.490
 work said that we were going to humor 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 then what it consists is you can not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.220
 find emerald blue skin and before 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 with the stones 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.520
 in the room you can also 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.230
 find gold to a master 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.210
 Gold and the main envelopes and 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.530
 pressing the keyboard is going to change is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.900
 We left and we will now be changed to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.580
 iron and what he is going to do is more value 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.850
 iron track marker that are 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.770
 closer to us here is therefore 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 as you can see the nearest one and it's going 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.740
 to say a marker how many blocks 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.299
 we're 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.819
 our block of something 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.180
 0.40 we are playing we are tying 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.680
 the analyzes in the we move away and then to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.990
 press right click as it returns us to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:25.790
 appear the marker I will appear 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:29.290
 now we have a block of 11 blocks to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.290
 9 a 8 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.379
 but by tchité here because not 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.379
 we want the missions 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 here 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.290
 there it is found when they are or are 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.150
 milestones and then if we break this 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.250
 if we see all this is going to resent 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.230
 marker and now gives us gives us the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 location of another block of iron by 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.739
 well tell him now is for here good not 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.810
 I'm going to be all the video mining 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.310
 blocks iron but then not some the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.980
 idea when you're a teacher the block that 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.269
 it is then in the marker it is reset and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.400
 I changed the comma 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.360
 then it lends very well really with 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.239
 videos for people who like 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.489
 mine but nevertheless not to take so long 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.380
 the mines because I when I get to 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.660
 mine takes me hours and hours and hours 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.790
 finding diamond eliminating everything 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.190
 right until the end of the world and then 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.890
 I find a few of those same 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.950
 then with this mode after and when 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.840
 cleanly in quotation marks but 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.700
 find the massage better and change to 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.290
 heat is gold as you can see this 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.610
 up to 8 blocks and then there are the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:55.640
 americ particles really 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.319
 why with its default color what 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.569
 is 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:06.930
 on this side and now we 're going 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.480
 now emerald for each factor if you 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.220
 we take away with fool 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.290
 now we do not find because emerald 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.750
 because it has a specific range 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 also our unlimited range as 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.780
 can see there you can not find any 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.000
 block is nothing 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.490
 to be far in the world that is nothing 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.030
 we want to find then we did the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.860
 things also so this song there 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.360
 that bring the values ​​closer and from 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.940
 that 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 where is it 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.440
 then here too 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.810
 our house the tomtom degree goes to 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.710
 be the same theme if we take it away friend 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.830
 here without control 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.640
 according to me the range of 40 and 50 blocks in 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.640
 40 points 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.640
 or not the range range 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.810
 the sky can probably be the 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.810
 hundred 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.840
 well I do not know what he 's saying is that 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.230
 as you found it blue can be 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.090
 very long and that does not matter here all the 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.740
 pleasures 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.890
 there is, however, what they are like extras 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.630
 turner because we are not going to see it and the mnr 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.610
 which is going to be the same and we do not see 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:27.220
 nothing 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:29.350
 so then it is today but I 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.940
 they like many particles and the mode of 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.560
 playability with this moment I hope that 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:39.820
 you are well you liked already you know 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 that does not exceed the limit for 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.500
 motorcycle pp download registration 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.600
 that does not have great science at all 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.370
 slow journalist very fast for the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.370
 more people install it 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.620
 so then we go to the people my 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.520
 facebook and twitter are circled down 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.009
 equally 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.749
 and you can 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:12.069
 well before I go I want to find a 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:12.069
 50 diamond 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.670
 and now 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.120
 ah 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:47.440
 then good affected and see you 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.440
 used until next time
