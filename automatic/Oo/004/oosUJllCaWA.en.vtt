 change your mentality of seeing people

 tattooed one gives me a lot of taste and more 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.540
 because the people are opening the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.879
 head as you say there are people who come 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.190

 that we are in the first world and that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.550
 it has taken away the prejudice and that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.649
 we really love each other because of course hey 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.869
 there was always that question in my mind 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.050
 when I saw interviews on the internet or in 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.680
 television when you decided to make yourself 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.430
 tattoos or implants you thought to get to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.500
 this point 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 look, actually, I never had you 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.550
 contemplated nothing has always wanted to be 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.869
 me and it will be authentic because being me 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.030
 while the person is authentic and 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.650
 Straight your life may be what you want 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.500
 I do not think that's the way it was 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.720
 well, yes, of course, because as 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.390
 who says the best I started a tattoo 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.390
 you said to me I want to do another and then 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.720
 I want to do an expansion and now 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.060
 when when you said and at this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 well what is what you bring here 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.850
 enter in your head the implant yes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.740
 yes it was a difficult decision and look at 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.750
 reality for me was born difficult because 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.760
 I am a painter from 4 years is called 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.650
 profoundly the modification as master 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.080
 my career as a lawyer has been very 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.540
 pair with me obviously all this was 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.120
 gradually careful is my story of 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.160
 personal life and I have it reflected in the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.900
 body and good all this is reflection of 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.929

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.600
 I think well yes I love your 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.280
 work and especially since I know that the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.170
 truth I 'll be honest I did not know 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.910
 you were good lawyer had 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.250
 knowledge that you were a mother 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.340
 of family really and well that but that 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.080
 He did not know if he studied 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.209
 right in guadalajara 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200
 I was obviously litigating six years of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.970
 my life 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.070
 nowadays I dedicate myself to defend the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.250
 rights of women rights 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.500
 of the family, because father 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 truth and finally to finish I know 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 that if you can go to many many 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.360
 questions and if people have any 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.930
 Well, well, here below in the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.019
 comments 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.180
 and this after a while I ask for your facebook and now 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.939
 It will also appear on the screen 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.799
 last question what advice do you give to 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:03.519
 young people or the family that has that 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.980
 thinking so weird that you think it 's 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.480
 the devil not and that this is your opinion 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.120
 exactly because we can not 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.120
 generalize how good we had people 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.609
 Brunette brunette white people and not 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.409
 that's why it's worth more than any other 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.419
 human beings we are worth very much not 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.239
 we can be so square more when we 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.669
 He has in his children and brothers because 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.829
 as they see me you can see them too 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.939
 it's better to be very open and love the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.579
 life is very short and there is no 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.769
