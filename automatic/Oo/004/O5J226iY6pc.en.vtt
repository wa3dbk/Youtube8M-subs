00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.610
 to make our chocolate muse 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.480
 white we need 180 grams of 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 200 grams of white chocolate cream 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.869
 ride and some pretty for decoration 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.099
 first of all we are going to assemble the cream and 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.669
 One important thing is that the back is 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.399
 very cold to swim that is very cold and 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.680
 in addition another detail is that we are not going to 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.559
 add sugar because the white chocolate 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.839
 has more concentration of sugar than 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.820
 dark chocolate and now just now 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.820
 with the rods we move to beat 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 we already have the cream here mounted as 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.360
 you see and in the water bath we have melted the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.810
 chocolate now let's go adding 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.540
 little by little we are going to put half 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.990
 of the whipped cream the chocolate and we're going 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.990
 to go mixing 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.340
 let's go mixing little by little 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.430
 as you see with the palette with the tongue 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 the chocolate is incorporated with the 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.039
 whipped cream 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.280
 we are linking and then we will put the 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.780
 other half 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 and we will do the same thing again 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.850
 we already have everything well mixed and now 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 we can only 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.110
 get the bones 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.960
 that we have here of glass can be 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.960
 to do in glass in glass in what you have 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.680
 we are going to fill and when we have them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 full we will go to the fridge 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.500
 this needs cold to set 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.380
 It needs cold with its minimum of about 12 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.960
 hours this is better to do it to the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.210
 hour for example in the afternoon to the hour 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.010
 to dine and for example for tomorrow to 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.010
 the dessert then we will have it ready 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.800
 we fill it, we fill it well and now 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800
 fridge with them 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.660
 and here we have our mousse 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.120
 white chocolate after all the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.790
 night in the fridge as you see has set 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.880
 has been hard with the cherries we have 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 done nice in half and there a 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.340
 little heart that can come to us 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.790
 perfectly as a dessert for the day of 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.220
 valentine 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.550
 and now we only have left 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.850
 take a little to see the texture 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.360
 look 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.850
 look at what texture 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.600
 so fabulous has our mousse of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.340
 white chocolate 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.160
 here we have it 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 I hope you liked it and you can see that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.590
 super easy to make and tastes great and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.830
 until next time 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.830
 goodbye
