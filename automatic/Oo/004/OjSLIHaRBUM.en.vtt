00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.400
 a threat hidden beneath the streets of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.440
 São Paulo is more than 300 rivers 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.170
 channeled that in times of rain 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.099
 usually overflows, worsening the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.260
 pines and tietê floods 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.500
 when thinking about rivers of the city of são 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.109
 paulo these two are the first to be 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.689
 the only ones that come to mind but 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 City Hall has registered 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 more than 300 rivers that even with 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.020
 urbanization are alive and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 occurring often on the assault 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 people have the view that rivers or 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 disappeared or are very small 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 inside buried pipes and theater in the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 Indeed the amount of water increased and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.550
 besides the water is dirty by me, right? 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 people have much of the sewage being 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.469
 played in the streams of são paulo ie 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.570
 the rivers they were always treated here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 as obstacles in development 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 and from there to buried a step the creek 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 water is one of these rivers that is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.400
 hidden it passes through the west 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 São Paulo in the flood season for not having 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 where to go 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.490
 he comes up there is another matter 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.920
 crosses the course of the stream black water 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 already in a low stretch near the outflow 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 on the river tietê 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 here there are no alternatives to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.299
 water drainage 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 so when it rains heavily 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.310
 floods are inevitable 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 the owner of this post one block from 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.130
 turiassu registered part of these damages 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.490
 he sees the streets become filled with water there 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 eight years it always happens well to be 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.159
 taken by cars that are broken 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.950
 who can not get around 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.170
 see cause and water in the engine and titles 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 a neighboring neighborhood the floods were 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 in the past 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 the region where the owls pass 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.960
 free from floods with measures 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.009
 simple and economical proposals 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 community 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.799
 this project was built blva 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.219
 letters and water comes then it is 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.740
 lower velocity being absorbed by the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.080
 land the rest comes being 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.240
 decelerated and filtered until you reach 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 stream in smaller quantity 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.670
 also never clears né the linear park 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.530
 the banks of the river owls also help 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.320
 in the first rain water absorption 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.410
 work page we are re-creating this 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.180
 people's connection to their rivers 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.210
 population with the nature of the environment 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.440
 Where do we live in this old city? 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.060
 even when that other 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
 respondent says daniel 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 the river has always been seen is seen sometimes 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.020
 as an obstacle 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.240
 There you go and cover USA with your mother thing. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.510
 also that the third wizards of all 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.780
 times not respecting the nature or 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 whether each river has its natural flow 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.760
 where to drain the water with its banks 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.390
 Imagine Sao Paulo having been 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 respected
