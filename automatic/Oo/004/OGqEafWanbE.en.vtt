00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello magic fans today there is one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.250
 video of another kind and that has the good 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.840
 Send me a private message 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.690
 Youtube sent that's a few 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.280
 promo codes gives and wants this short 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 I naturally like to share with you because 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.590
 I did not know it yet 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.699
 in the meantime also at magix 2014 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.650
 2013 meeting was already quite right 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.359
 many of them and I can easily do it for you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.890
 show you here at the fire roller 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 For example, we are completely free 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.289
 We now have 30 from 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.180
 35 cards and then one in the deck 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 administration goes in then you can see here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 There are again five blocked cards 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 to get hold of here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 just how can we get them now 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 yes we could of course free 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.180
 just switch by playing but 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 there are a few things that are easier 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 away and you have to do it easy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.840
 go here on extras and then on promo 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 share and namely on chrome share 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 but also unlockable pro must 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.739
 then this is magic the gathering hol 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.719
 give you your promo card and click there 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 then you enter on code 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.680
 the first code I here for you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.350
 I would have trc ksc was ok and click it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 new cards have been unlocked 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.210
 that was going too fast now 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.560
 Just back and press on the break 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.490
 next code is fth pth moment look 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.950
 I'll leave you a little bit more 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 stand for the break and it was 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 again new cards unlocked yes so 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.180
 This can be done quickly 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 the third code prs and then three times that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 t 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.540
 this should actually pretty they were 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.770
 again cards were unlocked and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.390
 what else do we have here gks ndr 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.850
 that would be the fourth promocode for the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.420
 I have for you and became again 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.060
 cards unlocked 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.490
 let's see the last one the sdw ndr and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.979
 Here are some more cards 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.930
 for the whole standard ecx now 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.939
 we could just look in the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.590
 blanket management, we can just do it 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.100
 go in here to see the fire roller 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.840
 you already 35 out of 35 and I believe that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.729
 are now easy first in 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.230
 Of course, the deck is purely mixed 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.540
 a little stupid because I had me 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.220
 really had a deck me like that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.670
 this is only 60 cards 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.180
 had I think or but are not 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.130
 in here 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.989
 but I believe this card for example 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.180
 here yes that is for example to it 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 Come on, I know that and pretty much 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 nice card I had already seen 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.959
 was for two times 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 So I did not even think so 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.549
 bad this one for twice a 1 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.209
 use was only but firstly has the 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.580
 Hurry 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.440
 and that means imagine if you do 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.549
 that has on the hand and allowed to start 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.019
 then you can in the second round 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.940
 already attack 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.739
 and whenever he came to a player 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.790
 Damage inflicts gets an 11 market 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.209
 pretty nice creature 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.040
 I think this was also new that is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.810
 again a creature with blood thirst 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.459
 the storm will not get any better 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.100
 be blocked except two or more 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.810
 cards not bad you should 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.370
 but then play with blood throats speak 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 best sun we come here first 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.040
 to attack the risk without it comes 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.170
 pure or so yes that is definitely 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.459
 actually the meaning of this video 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.590
 I have been a bit short 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.840
 but it was only about it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.150
 So to share the promos with you 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.560
 Many thanks to roman for the hint and 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.450
 also for all the comments that there 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.709
 The guy always seems to write 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.420
 but a little better with magic 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.000
 to know as I but I guess 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.190
 of which there are so few of you in 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.570
 We enjoy it 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.570
