train yard as you can see here it is
much<00:00:12.950> more<00:00:13.160> organized<00:00:13.640> and<00:00:15.070> actually<00:00:16.070> a

much more organized and actually a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.439 
much more organized and actually a
little<00:00:16.159> bit<00:00:16.339> more<00:00:16.429> chaotic<00:00:16.909> but<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:17.329> is

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
little bit more chaotic but it is

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.489 
little bit more chaotic but it is
organized<00:00:17.900> trust<00:00:18.230> me

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:18.499

so what I've done here is I've moved the
ocean<00:00:21.980> out<00:00:22.130> it<00:00:22.369> used<00:00:22.519> to<00:00:22.640> actually<00:00:22.909> be<00:00:22.999> right

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
ocean out it used to actually be right

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.450 
ocean out it used to actually be right
here<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:23.869> if<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.319> see<00:00:24.349> this<00:00:24.679> line<00:00:24.949> it<00:00:25.130> divides

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
here and if you see this line it divides

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.249 
here and if you see this line it divides
the<00:00:25.669> where<00:00:26.149> the<00:00:26.210> table<00:00:26.539> used<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:26.810> end<00:00:26.989> and

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
the where the table used to end and

out<00:00:29.989> of<00:00:30.079> the<00:00:30.140> way<00:00:30.319> to<00:00:31.099> build<00:00:31.310> this<00:00:31.489> table<00:00:31.729> and

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
out of the way to build this table and

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.799 
out of the way to build this table and
this<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.620> now<00:00:33.920> my<00:00:34.250> my<00:00:34.850> train<00:00:35.090> engine<00:00:35.359> shed<00:00:35.600> and

trains<00:01:55.190> how<00:01:55.490> they<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.760> access<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.210> line<00:01:56.360> if

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
trains how they can access the line if

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.810 
trains how they can access the line if
we<00:01:56.840> need<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.110> utilize<00:01:57.440> them<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.830> they<00:01:58.520> have<00:01:58.640> two

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
we need to utilize them is they have two

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.430 
we need to utilize them is they have two
options<00:01:59.210> here<00:01:59.270> they<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.660> go<00:02:00.020> off<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.290> this

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
options here they can go off of this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.790 
options here they can go off of this
track<00:02:00.970> which<00:02:01.970> splits<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.540> two<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.440> looks<00:02:03.500> like

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
track which splits in two it looks like

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200 
track which splits in two it looks like
look<00:02:03.950> out<00:02:04.040> joshie<00:02:04.310> move<00:02:04.610> over<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.880> little<00:02:05.000> bit

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
look out joshie move over a little bit

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.700 
look out joshie move over a little bit
there<00:02:05.480> buddy<00:02:05.660> thanks<00:02:06.310> into<00:02:07.310> four<00:02:08.000> tracks<00:02:08.300> and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
there buddy thanks into four tracks and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.500 
there buddy thanks into four tracks and
also<00:02:09.710> access<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> train<00:02:10.700> train<00:02:11.270> engine

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
also access to the train train engine

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.740 
also access to the train train engine
shed

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
shed

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.360 
shed
and<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.740> can<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.040> had<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.340> of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and as you can see I had a lot of

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.700 
and as you can see I had a lot of
stationary<00:02:14.880> trains<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:16.020> needed<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
stationary trains I really needed I

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.960 
stationary trains I really needed I
really<00:02:17.160> needed<00:02:17.310> something<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.610> park<00:02:17.850> these

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
really needed something to park these

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.560 
really needed something to park these
babies<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.100> also<00:02:20.330> continue<00:02:21.330> on

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
babies in and they can also continue on

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.990 
babies in and they can also continue on
down<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:22.350> straight<00:02:22.850> where<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
down here and go straight where this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.960 
down here and go straight where this
train<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:25.400> well<00:02:26.400> that's<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.700> cool<00:02:26.850> about

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
train is well that's really cool about

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
train is well that's really cool about
this<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.450> while<00:02:28.020> these<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> lot<00:02:28.590> easier<00:02:28.830> dead

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this is while these a lot easier dead

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.260 
this is while these a lot easier dead
ends<00:02:29.280> obviously<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.150> actually

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
ends obviously but this one actually

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
ends obviously but this one actually
loops<00:02:30.660> around<00:02:31.020> all<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.250> way<00:02:32.400> back

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
loops around all the way back

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270 
loops around all the way back
so<00:02:33.570> essentially<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.410> would<00:02:34.680> happen<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
so essentially what would happen if the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.340 
so essentially what would happen if the
train<00:02:35.520> came<00:02:35.820> down<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.180> way<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.600> utilize<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
train came down this way and utilize the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.510 
train came down this way and utilize the
whole<00:02:37.530> loop<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:39.090> would<00:02:39.950> actually<00:02:40.950> turn<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
whole loop it would actually turn the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.090 
whole loop it would actually turn the
train<00:02:41.820> around<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.660> since<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.740> don't<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
train around and since I don't have a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.949 
train around and since I don't have a
turntable<00:02:44.460> that's<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.810> nice

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
turntable that's kind of a nice

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.410 
turntable that's kind of a nice
substitute<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.620> now<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.850> yeah<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
substitute for now so so yeah that's it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.890 
substitute for now so so yeah that's it
that's<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> update<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.130> oh<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.600> guess

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that's the update for now and oh I guess

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's the update for now and oh I guess
the<00:02:52.350> pier<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.709> next<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.160> need<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> really

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the pier is next I need to really

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.370 
the pier is next I need to really
organize<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.510> maybe<00:02:54.720> I'll<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:55.080> my<00:02:55.200> next

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
organize that so maybe I'll be my next

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.650 
organize that so maybe I'll be my next
project<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:55.920> update<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.340> everybody<00:02:56.520> but<00:02:57.420> for

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
project and update for everybody but for

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.680 
project and update for everybody but for
now<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.840> train<00:02:58.350> engine<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.510> train<00:03:00.510> yard

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
now the train engine the train yard

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.570 
now the train engine the train yard
looks<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.080> good<00:03:01.200> I'm<00:03:01.709> pretty<00:03:02.100> happy<00:03:02.370> with

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
looks really good I'm pretty happy with

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.810 
looks really good I'm pretty happy with
it

and<00:03:02.970> will<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:04.110> already<00:03:04.530> tested<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.860> trains

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and will it's already tested the trains

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.360 
and will it's already tested the trains
out<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.459> looks<00:03:05.610> pretty<00:03:05.820> good<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.650> will<00:03:07.650> show

pretty good okay and here's the
Metroliner<00:03:49.580> making<00:03:49.940> its<00:03:50.060> round

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.710 

and<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.790> trains<00:04:05.000> obviously<00:04:05.390> still<00:04:05.600> have

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
and the trains obviously still have

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.900 
and the trains obviously still have
access<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.140> go<00:04:06.350> up<00:04:06.500> into<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.430> upper<00:04:07.640> level

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
access to go up into the the upper level

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.370 
access to go up into the the upper level
there<00:04:07.940> there's<00:04:08.690> still<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> lot<00:04:08.960> of<00:04:08.990> work<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.290> do

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
there there's still a lot of work to do

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.770 
there there's still a lot of work to do
up<00:04:09.620> there<00:04:09.800> but<00:04:10.100> I'll<00:04:10.700> get<00:04:10.850> there<00:04:11.090> eventually

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
up there but I'll get there eventually

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.320 
up there but I'll get there eventually
always<00:04:12.080> always<00:04:12.770> something<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.100> do<00:04:13.330> alright
