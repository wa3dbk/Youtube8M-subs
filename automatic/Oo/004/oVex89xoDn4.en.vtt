00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.860
 yes 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.289
 hello good morning at the pharmacy 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.259
 look I called because it would take a 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.290
 product know allergan look in my case 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.360
 It's a bit special because I 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.560
 I would need something to go back to smoking 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.190
 to quit smoking 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.490
 but I would like something to go back to 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.490
 smoke 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.859
 come on we understand 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.890
 and now I think there is also and there was 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.679
 some products like patches for 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 stop smoking but now what I 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.350
 I require and what I need is something to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.929
 go back to smoking 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.870
 already practicing with a cigarette I 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.249
 I light and I smoked it while everyone 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.159
 because he needs something to go back to smoking 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:02.130
 because my carola girl wants me 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:05.160
 I went back to smoking because I smoked 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.570
 three years ago a daily package and what 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.960
 I left it because it's something that made me 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 hurt Carol insists that I go back to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.050
 smoking thinks I'm more man does not say 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 that man there be no smoking 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.210
 you already understand me things about women then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 Of course I would need something to go back to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.280
 smoke but when I added then I 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.840
 when I smoke toxo there's really nothing 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.840
 there is no product 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.160
 that you avoid doing when you smoke 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.350
 say that man put a candy on 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.000
 the mouth smelling one of those things but 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 specifically for what he asks me not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 There is nothing that I will try to solve 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.910
 this you put on a candy 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.190
 these antitussive in the mouth every time 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.290
 who smokes there but what is it that your case is 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.970
 some particularly I told you burn 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 that my case was a little particular 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.880
 because for my friends they are all 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.340
 players smoke they all know and I 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.100
 On the contrary, I have to go back to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 smoking because of course if it does not say that I'm not 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.580
 a man 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.760
 and he gets angry with me and bng to insist 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.650
 that I smoked the child was a message 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.489
 I'm going through very badly because of course 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.629
 every time he tried to go back to vice 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.620
 fence like a descocido needs 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:30.620
 a little foot 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.989
 normally I do not carol if I know him 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.519
 me my partner not sure if 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.190
 llama carlos good surely the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:42.890
 Diera is very beautiful and she is also very 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.269
 pretty good, of course, I'm going to say that 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.359
 I am that if your partner but you this 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.040
 can some album make some message or 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.280
 some formula of man so that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.849
 cause anxiety to re-add of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.349
 say to see in principle to see is not 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.879
 advisable to smoke 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.280
 if you want to go back to smoking you should 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.230
 do is start within the time not 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.209
 will have no need to create the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.739
 habit and photo the world starts with more 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.830
 you do not have any desire when you understand 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.660
 to the Kirchner because you smoke 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.660
 and when he says that 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.680
 for the chest as well as we have 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 fact 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.560
 but I smoke I smoke very little 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.170
 also but it is that when you smoke a 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.660
 cigar I got a cough that I did not want 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.720
 talk but if it feels so bad better 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.340
 I do other things because it's one thing 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.620
 it feels good and it will be so 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.570
 harmful because I do not know what I do 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.540
 that now other things that she decides 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.850
 but others are not you understand 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.090
 billionaire a cigarette and less 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.090
 doing 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.299
 do not 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.940
 fatal wrist 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.940
 other 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:21.500
 I 'm going to tell him that I do not want to smoke 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.750
 that is always very heavy with 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.610
 that I look like right here but I do not 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.789
 can be 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.810
 I'm going to say four little things well said 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.380

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.289
