flying<00:00:37.020> water<00:00:37.350> type<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.040> only<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.489> about

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
flying water type you only think about

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
flying water type you only think about
too<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.420> expect<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> be

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
too much and you would expect it to be

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
too much and you would expect it to be
much<00:00:40.320> worse<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.250> only<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.820> time<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.480> two

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
much worse but it's only one time or two

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.330 
much worse but it's only one time or two
times<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.930> week<00:00:42.960> against<00:00:43.230> Rock<00:00:43.440> four<00:00:44.010> times<00:00:44.219> we

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
times a week against Rock four times we

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
times a week against Rock four times we
give<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.579> Selectric<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.149> electric<00:00:45.539> attacks

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
give them Selectric now electric attacks

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
give them Selectric now electric attacks
are<00:00:46.050> bad<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> deal<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.160> you'd<00:00:47.309> imagine

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
are bad to deal with if you'd imagine

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.889 
are bad to deal with if you'd imagine
like<00:00:47.730> flying<00:00:47.940> water<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.870> more

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
like flying water would be a little more

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.869 
like flying water would be a little more
vulnerable<00:00:49.440> yet<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> isn't<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.700> pretty

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
vulnerable yet it isn't so that's pretty

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.369 
vulnerable yet it isn't so that's pretty
good<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.449> immunity<00:00:51.600> five

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
good we have an immunity five

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
good we have an immunity five
resistances<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.699> strong<00:00:54.030> typing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
resistances very strong typing

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
resistances very strong typing
surprisingly<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> does<00:00:55.559> work<00:00:55.800> with

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
surprisingly and it does work with

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
surprisingly and it does work with
Mantine<00:00:56.579> hopping<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.390> Pokemon<00:00:57.719> showdown<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Mantine hopping into Pokemon showdown I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.529 
Mantine hopping into Pokemon showdown I
just<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> idea<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> Mantine<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just like the idea of Mantine and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.819 
just like the idea of Mantine and
doubles<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.079> gonna<00:01:01.260> mention<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> one

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
doubles so I'm gonna mention that one

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.380 
doubles so I'm gonna mention that one
first<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:03.180> interesting

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
first now I have a really interesting

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.649 
first now I have a really interesting
set<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> decided<00:01:04.320> modest<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.540> 156<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
set here I decided modest with a 156 and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
set here I decided modest with a 156 and
special<00:01:07.020> tag<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.439> Vincere<00:01:07.770> hit<00:01:07.890> points<00:01:08.159> 100

special tag to Vincere hit points 100

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
special tag to Vincere hit points 100
speed<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.840> makes<00:01:10.110> sense<00:01:10.350> because<00:01:10.530> Mantine<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
speed it makes sense because Mantine is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
speed it makes sense because Mantine is
one<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.000> Pokemon<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.659> tailwind<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
one of two Pokemon to get tailwind and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.620 
one of two Pokemon to get tailwind and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
wide guard that the other Pokemon is

wide guard that the other Pokemon is

gonna<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:21.030> strong<00:01:21.270> double<00:01:21.570> support

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
gonna be a very strong double support

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
gonna be a very strong double support
move<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> tailwind<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.520> very

strong<00:01:24.150> supportive<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> set<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.170> tailwind

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
strong supportive so you set up tailwind

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
strong supportive so you set up tailwind

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
wide guard boost and that's going to be

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
wide guard boost and that's going to be
pretty<00:01:55.229> strong<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.340> ice<00:01:56.520> beam

and<00:01:56.969> air<00:01:57.180> slash<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.409> 100<00:01:58.890> V's<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and air slash and as for that 100 V's in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
and air slash and as for that 100 V's in
the<00:01:59.430> speed<00:01:59.700> well<00:02:00.149> since<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.570> using

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the speed well since we are using

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.050 
the speed well since we are using
tailwind<00:02:01.290> doubling<00:02:01.680> our<00:02:01.799> speed<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.310> level<00:02:02.670> 50

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
tailwind doubling our speed at level 50

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.690 
tailwind doubling our speed at level 50
so<00:02:03.329> that'll<00:02:03.930> spot<00:02:04.110> rank<00:02:04.469> battle<00:02:04.890> spot<00:02:05.100> VGC

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
so that'll spot rank battle spot VGC

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
so that'll spot rank battle spot VGC
anything<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> we're<00:02:06.899> gonna<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.110> speed

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
anything like that we're gonna out speed

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
anything like that we're gonna out speed
135<00:02:08.129> base<00:02:08.399> speed<00:02:08.640> pokemon<00:02:09.060> after<00:02:09.390> the

135 base speed pokemon after the
tailwind

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
tailwind

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
tailwind
which<00:02:10.500> means<00:02:10.890> we're<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.340> faster

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
which means we're going to be faster

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.980 
which means we're going to be faster
than<00:02:11.670> almost<00:02:11.970> every<00:02:12.300> Pokemon

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
than almost every Pokemon

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.570 
than almost every Pokemon
and<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.800> good<00:02:13.980> support<00:02:14.370> air

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580
