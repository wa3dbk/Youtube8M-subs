00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
double G through K cups and this was

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.609 
double G through K cups and this was
very<00:00:22.119> exciting<00:00:22.570> for<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.809> fuller<00:00:23.020> bust<00:00:23.230> market

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
very exciting for the fuller bust market

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.990 
very exciting for the fuller bust market
because<00:00:23.919> there<00:00:24.369> aren't<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.669> whole<00:00:24.700> lot<00:00:24.849> of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
because there aren't a whole lot of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.089 
because there aren't a whole lot of
options<00:00:25.239> out<00:00:25.570> there<00:00:25.720> anyway<00:00:26.079> so<00:00:26.110> for<00:00:26.710> a<00:00:26.739> brand

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
options out there anyway so for a brand

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.920 
options out there anyway so for a brand
to<00:00:27.279> recognize<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.939> need<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.270> actually<00:00:28.390> do<00:00:28.840> an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
to recognize the need and actually do an

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.830 
to recognize the need and actually do an
expansion<00:00:29.230> was<00:00:29.680> fantastic<00:00:30.489> so<00:00:31.329> they<00:00:31.480> ended<00:00:31.750> up

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
expansion was fantastic so they ended up

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.720 
expansion was fantastic so they ended up
expanding<00:00:32.500> three<00:00:32.770> different<00:00:33.070> styles<00:00:33.250> the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
expanding three different styles the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.790 
expanding three different styles the
Charlotte<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.420> Sophia<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.050> then<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.350> Alexis

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
Charlotte the Sophia and then the Alexis

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.160 
Charlotte the Sophia and then the Alexis
baby<00:00:36.070> doll<00:00:36.309> I<00:00:36.609> tried<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.510> Charlotte<00:00:37.899> first

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
baby doll I tried the Charlotte first

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.479 
baby doll I tried the Charlotte first
because<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.649> really<00:00:38.920> don't<00:00:39.039> have<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.309> lot<00:00:39.429> of

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
because I really don't have a lot of

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.829 
because I really don't have a lot of
padded<00:00:39.850> bra<00:00:39.969> options<00:00:40.359> and<00:00:40.539> I<00:00:40.600> thought<00:00:40.750> it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
padded bra options and I thought it

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.779 
padded bra options and I thought it
would<00:00:40.929> be<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.079> nice<00:00:41.260> change<00:00:41.289> of<00:00:41.710> pace<00:00:41.769> but<00:00:42.760> I

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
would be a nice change of pace but I

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.369 
would be a nice change of pace but I
found<00:00:42.999> that<00:00:43.179> there<00:00:43.329> were<00:00:43.449> some<00:00:43.600> finishers<00:00:44.109> so

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
found that there were some finishers so

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.709 
found that there were some finishers so
I<00:00:44.589> ended<00:00:45.010> up<00:00:45.100> putting<00:00:45.429> the<00:00:45.699> Sophia<00:00:46.359> on<00:00:46.570> the

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
I ended up putting the Sophia on the

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.169 
I ended up putting the Sophia on the
back<00:00:46.870> burner<00:00:47.079> until<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:48.039> was<00:00:48.249> desperate<00:00:48.699> for<00:00:48.730> a

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
back burner until I was desperate for a

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.509 
back burner until I was desperate for a
new<00:00:49.210> white<00:00:49.719> bra<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.289> then<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.890> thought<00:00:51.100> maybe<00:00:51.339> I

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
new white bra and then I thought maybe I

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.259 
new white bra and then I thought maybe I
would<00:00:51.640> give<00:00:51.879> it<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.030> try

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
would give it a try

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.139 
would give it a try
so<00:00:53.170> in<00:00:53.559> when<00:00:54.129> I<00:00:54.159> had<00:00:54.309> ordered<00:00:54.579> these<00:00:54.670> Charlotte

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
so in when I had ordered these Charlotte

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.299 
so in when I had ordered these Charlotte
I<00:00:55.239> ended<00:00:55.539> up<00:00:55.629> needing<00:00:55.839> a<00:00:56.170> 30-j<00:00:56.649> which<00:00:57.159> was

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
I ended up needing a 30-j which was

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.279 
I ended up needing a 30-j which was
still<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.550> little<00:00:57.879> small<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.449> cup<00:00:58.629> but<00:00:59.260> the

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
still a little small in the cup but the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.200 
still a little small in the cup but the
double<00:00:59.800> J<00:00:59.920> was<00:01:00.129> creating<00:01:00.489> too<00:01:00.609> many<00:01:00.789> issues<00:01:00.909> on

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
double J was creating too many issues on

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.840 
double J was creating too many issues on
the<00:01:01.300> side<00:01:01.510> for<00:01:01.809> me<00:01:01.839> so<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.769> went<00:01:03.100> right<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.550> 30

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
the side for me so I went right to a 30

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.590 
the side for me so I went right to a 30
J<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:05.100> Sophia<00:01:06.100> as<00:01:06.280> well<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.480> what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
J in the Sophia as well and this is what

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.160 
J in the Sophia as well and this is what
I<00:01:07.630> have<00:01:07.810> on<00:01:07.840> right<00:01:08.020> now<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.430> band<00:01:09.670> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I have on right now the band is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.020 
I have on right now the band is
wonderful<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.440> super<00:01:11.890> comfortable<00:01:12.850> but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
wonderful it is super comfortable but

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.090 
wonderful it is super comfortable but
very<00:01:13.240> snug<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:13.990> feel<00:01:14.170> very<00:01:14.350> supported<00:01:14.560> it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
very snug so I feel very supported it's

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
very snug so I feel very supported it's
very<00:01:15.280> anchored<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.820> body<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> cup

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
very anchored to the body but the cup

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.340 
very anchored to the body but the cup
size<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:18.100> too<00:01:18.670> small<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.150> would<00:01:19.720> probably<00:01:20.050> need

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
size is too small I would probably need

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.980 
size is too small I would probably need
the<00:01:20.470> double<00:01:20.740> J<00:01:20.860> cup<00:01:21.100> again<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.570> overall

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
the double J cup again and the overall

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.650 
the double J cup again and the overall
design<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.920> still<00:01:24.700> not<00:01:24.880> quite<00:01:25.060> right<00:01:25.180> for<00:01:25.540> me

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
design is still not quite right for me

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.840 
design is still not quite right for me
one<00:01:26.410> of<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.530> things<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.830> do<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:27.070> about<00:01:27.310> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
one of the things I do like about the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.970 
one of the things I do like about the
charlotte<00:01:28.840> bra<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.260> had<00:01:29.440> tried<00:01:29.650> was<00:01:29.860> that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
charlotte bra that I had tried was that

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.010 
charlotte bra that I had tried was that
the<00:01:30.040> underwire<00:01:30.400> very<00:01:30.820> narrow<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.660> was<00:01:31.780> kind

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
the underwire very narrow and I was kind

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.890 
the underwire very narrow and I was kind
of<00:01:32.080> expecting<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.710> with<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.690> Sophia<00:01:34.690> as

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
of expecting that with the Sophia as

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.920 
of expecting that with the Sophia as
well<00:01:35.260> however<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.220> can<00:01:36.430> see<00:01:36.730> they<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.510> go

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
well however as you can see they do go

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.630 
well however as you can see they do go
back<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.410> significant<00:01:39.010> amount<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.250> really<00:01:39.490> have

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
back a significant amount I really have

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.210 
back a significant amount I really have
almost<00:01:40.060> three<00:01:40.510> full<00:01:41.110> fingers<00:01:41.560> worth<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.950> space

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
almost three full fingers worth of space

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.560 
almost three full fingers worth of space
between<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.730> underwire<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.180> where<00:01:43.450> my

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
between the underwire and where my

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.840 
between the underwire and where my
breast<00:01:43.810> tissue<00:01:44.050> starts<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.670> way

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
breast tissue starts so this is just way

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.510 
breast tissue starts so this is just way
too<00:01:45.910> wide<00:01:46.240> for<00:01:46.270> me<00:01:46.980> they're<00:01:47.980> pretty<00:01:48.190> narrow<00:01:48.340> at

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
too wide for me they're pretty narrow at

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.730 
too wide for me they're pretty narrow at
the<00:01:48.640> center<00:01:48.940> though<00:01:49.090> that's<00:01:49.330> not<00:01:49.510> bad<00:01:49.750> but<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
the center though that's not bad but the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.430 
the center though that's not bad but the
overall<00:01:51.280> shape<00:01:51.550> again<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.210> very<00:01:52.420> shallow<00:01:52.810> so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
overall shape again is very shallow so

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.290 
overall shape again is very shallow so
what<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.040> means<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.580> here<00:01:54.880> towards<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
what that means is here towards the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.790 
what that means is here towards the
center<00:01:55.600> particularly<00:01:56.200> there's<00:01:56.410> not<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> lot<00:01:56.770> of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
center particularly there's not a lot of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.850 
center particularly there's not a lot of
depth<00:01:57.160> there's<00:01:57.820> also<00:01:58.000> not<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:58.510> much<00:01:58.780> room<00:01:59.650> at

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
depth there's also not as much room at

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.520 
depth there's also not as much room at
the<00:01:59.950> top<00:02:00.220> either<00:02:00.610> for<00:02:01.390> any<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.840> us<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:01.990> breast

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the top either for any of us to breast

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.520 
the top either for any of us to breast
tissue<00:02:02.740> up<00:02:02.980> there<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.730> fit<00:02:04.150> as<00:02:04.540> well<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
tissue up there to fit as well the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.860 
tissue up there to fit as well the
bottom<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:06.100> also<00:02:06.280> very<00:02:06.700> shallow<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.330> overall<00:02:07.750> I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
bottom is also very shallow so overall I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.719 
bottom is also very shallow so overall I
really<00:02:08.170> feel<00:02:08.319> like<00:02:08.349> this<00:02:08.500> entire<00:02:08.890> design<00:02:09.399> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
really feel like this entire design is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.029 
really feel like this entire design is
meant<00:02:10.060> for<00:02:10.149> someone<00:02:10.390> who<00:02:10.539> has<00:02:10.629> more

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
meant for someone who has more

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.759 
meant for someone who has more
a<00:02:11.069> bus<00:02:11.489> type<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:13.049> I'm<00:02:13.140> actually<00:02:13.349> seeing

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
a bus type and what I'm actually seeing

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.940 
a bus type and what I'm actually seeing
in<00:02:14.340> addition<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.000> some<00:02:15.299> overflow<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.799> on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
in addition to some overflow is that on

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
in addition to some overflow is that on
the<00:02:17.280> profile<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.599> giving<00:02:18.870> me<00:02:18.900> a

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the profile it's kind of giving me a

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.470 
the profile it's kind of giving me a
downward<00:02:19.709> point<00:02:20.129> now<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.849> reason<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.299> broad

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
downward point now the reason a broad

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
downward point now the reason a broad
can<00:02:21.689> do<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.109> one<00:02:22.409> of<00:02:22.530> them<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> top

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
can do that one of them is that the top

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.080 
can do that one of them is that the top
part<00:02:24.689> of<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> fabric<00:02:25.379> does<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.549> enough

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
part of the fabric does not have enough

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.699 
part of the fabric does not have enough
space<00:02:27.329> for<00:02:27.510> your<00:02:27.870> breast<00:02:28.079> tissue<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.500> isn't

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
space for your breast tissue and isn't

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.619 
space for your breast tissue and isn't
stretching<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.220> accommodate<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.450> your

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
stretching to accommodate it so your

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.149 
stretching to accommodate it so your
breast<00:02:30.810> tissue<00:02:30.930> has<00:02:31.230> no<00:02:31.470> choice<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:32.129> to

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
breast tissue has no choice but to

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.009 
breast tissue has no choice but to
either<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.609> pushed<00:02:32.640> upwards<00:02:33.239> which<00:02:33.540> mine<00:02:33.989> is

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
either be pushed upwards which mine is

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.899 
either be pushed upwards which mine is
being<00:02:34.319> pushed<00:02:34.500> upwards<00:02:34.829> but<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.549> also<00:02:35.730> be

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
being pushed upwards but it can also be

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.059 
being pushed upwards but it can also be
pushed<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.359> downwards<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:37.019> an<00:02:37.139> angle<00:02:37.530> as<00:02:37.709> well

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
pushed to downwards at an angle as well

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.580 
pushed to downwards at an angle as well
it's<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:39.000> sign<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.629> entire<00:02:40.049> style

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
it's really a sign that the entire style

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's really a sign that the entire style
of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.950> bra<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.219> not<00:02:41.459> quite<00:02:41.730> right<00:02:41.849> for<00:02:42.060> your

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
of the bra is not quite right for your

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.059 
of the bra is not quite right for your
breast<00:02:42.389> shape<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.349> exactly<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:43.950> I'm

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
breast shape and that's exactly what I'm

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.610 
breast shape and that's exactly what I'm
getting<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.629> just<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.049> too<00:02:46.349> shallow

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
getting here it's just it's too shallow

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.379 
getting here it's just it's too shallow
in<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.950> center<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.459> too<00:02:47.670> wide<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.150> side

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
in the center it's too wide on the side

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.330 
in the center it's too wide on the side
and<00:02:48.750> again<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.439> really<00:02:49.709> don't<00:02:49.889> have<00:02:49.950> enough

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and again I really don't have enough

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
and again I really don't have enough
space<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.079> went<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.439> thirty

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
space I think if I went with a thirty

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.470 
space I think if I went with a thirty
double<00:02:52.980> J<00:02:53.129> some<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.489> might<00:02:53.879> be<00:02:53.909> corrected

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
double J some of this might be corrected

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
double J some of this might be corrected
a<00:02:54.569> little<00:02:54.900> bit<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> overflow<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
a little bit like the overflow but the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.569 
a little bit like the overflow but the
overall<00:02:57.299> style<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.349> just<00:02:58.620> not<00:02:58.889> right<00:02:59.189> for<00:02:59.250> me

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
overall style is just not right for me

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.899 
overall style is just not right for me
now<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.389> do<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.989> very<00:03:01.319> closed<00:03:01.739> set<00:03:02.069> breasts<00:03:02.760> so

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
now I do have very closed set breasts so

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.699 
now I do have very closed set breasts so
I<00:03:02.939> need<00:03:03.180> something<00:03:03.419> that's<00:03:03.599> narrow<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.439> deep

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I need something that's narrow and deep

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.770 
I need something that's narrow and deep
and<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.459> again<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.730> really<00:03:06.209> isn't<00:03:06.599> quite

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and this again just really isn't quite

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.500 
and this again just really isn't quite
in<00:03:06.930> line<00:03:07.169> with<00:03:07.409> that<00:03:07.439> I<00:03:08.310> am<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:09.120> sad

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in line with that I am a little sad

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.879 
in line with that I am a little sad
about<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.840> because<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.500> feel<00:03:10.859> like

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
about that because I feel like

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.030 
about that because I feel like
particularly<00:03:11.669> in<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.209> gg+<00:03:12.900> market<00:03:13.560> you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
particularly in that gg+ market you

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.740 
particularly in that gg+ market you
really<00:03:14.069> do<00:03:14.430> have<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:15.000> women<00:03:15.299> who<00:03:15.419> need

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
really do have a lot of women who need

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.270 
really do have a lot of women who need
something<00:03:16.109> that's<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.739> give<00:03:17.010> them<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
something that's going to give them a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.490 
something that's going to give them a
little<00:03:17.459> bit<00:03:17.639> more<00:03:17.849> depth<00:03:18.120> they<00:03:19.109> might<00:03:19.349> need

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
little bit more depth they might need

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.140 
little bit more depth they might need
the<00:03:19.680> wider<00:03:19.859> wires<00:03:20.159> but<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.609> at<00:03:20.699> least<00:03:20.729> need<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the wider wires but they at least need a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.930 
the wider wires but they at least need a
little<00:03:21.389> more<00:03:21.540> depth<00:03:21.810> toward<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.260> center

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
little more depth toward the center

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.490 
little more depth toward the center
however<00:03:23.940> again<00:03:24.389> considering<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.409> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
however again considering this is one of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
however again considering this is one of
their<00:03:25.620> first<00:03:25.829> efforts<00:03:26.340> into<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.639> market<00:03:26.940> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
their first efforts into the market I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.250 
their first efforts into the market I
really<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.389> have<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.629> say<00:03:27.810> they've<00:03:27.989> they've

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
really do have to say they've they've

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.409 
really do have to say they've they've
done<00:03:28.470> some<00:03:28.680> great<00:03:28.889> things<00:03:28.949> with<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> first<00:03:30.180> off

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
done some great things with it first off

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.610 
done some great things with it first off
they<00:03:30.569> did<00:03:30.750> go<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:31.079> for<00:03:31.199> a<00:03:31.260> fully<00:03:31.500> adjustable

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
they did go right for a fully adjustable

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.770 
they did go right for a fully adjustable
strap<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.760> strap<00:03:32.790> itself<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.419> a<00:03:33.479> little

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
strap and the strap itself is a little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
strap and the strap itself is a little
wider<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.290> well<00:03:34.560> which<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.889> like<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.400> feel<00:03:36.060> like

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
wider as well which I like I feel like

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.360 
wider as well which I like I feel like
this<00:03:36.329> does<00:03:36.629> give<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.169> little<00:03:37.620> bit<00:03:37.799> more<00:03:37.859> support

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
this does give a little bit more support

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.699 
this does give a little bit more support
here<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.760> disperses<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.510> weight<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.530> bust

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
here it disperses the weight of the bust

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.670 
here it disperses the weight of the bust
across<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.129> shoulder<00:03:41.549> they<00:03:42.269> also<00:03:42.569> do<00:03:42.989> for

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
across the shoulder they also do for

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.409 
across the shoulder they also do for
hook<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.069> eye<00:03:44.129> closures<00:03:44.549> in<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.209> I

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
hook and eye closures in the back and I

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.360 
hook and eye closures in the back and I
cannot<00:03:45.720> tell<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.109> how<00:03:46.739> much<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.190> absolutely

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
cannot tell you how much I absolutely

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.240 
cannot tell you how much I absolutely
love<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:48.239> design<00:03:48.629> decision<00:03:48.889> when<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:49.979> have

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
love this design decision when you have

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.789 
love this design decision when you have
this<00:03:50.459> extra<00:03:51.060> wider<00:03:51.659> band<00:03:52.019> here<00:03:52.409> as<00:03:52.530> well<00:03:52.680> as

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this extra wider band here as well as

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.649 
this extra wider band here as well as
the<00:03:52.919> more<00:03:53.069> hook<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.370> eye<00:03:53.430> closures<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:54.120> again

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
the more hook and eye closures it again

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.539 
the more hook and eye closures it again
disperses<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.620> weight<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.979> bus<00:03:56.129> across<00:03:56.459> a

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
disperses the weight of the bus across a

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.759 
disperses the weight of the bus across a
larger<00:03:57.030> surface<00:03:57.299> area<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.409> don't<00:03:58.530> feel

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
larger surface area so you don't feel

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.379 
larger surface area so you don't feel
like<00:03:58.829> you're<00:03:59.069> supporting<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.729> entire<00:04:00.000> bust

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
like you're supporting the entire bust

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.780 
like you're supporting the entire bust
in<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.689> tiny<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.019> band<00:04:01.439> as<00:04:01.769> much<00:04:02.489> as<00:04:02.669> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
in this tiny little band as much as I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.210 
in this tiny little band as much as I
love<00:04:03.000> my<00:04:03.239> Clio<00:04:03.569> bras<00:04:03.870> from<00:04:04.109> panache<00:04:04.530> they<00:04:05.040> are

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
love my Clio bras from panache they are

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.210 
love my Clio bras from panache they are
also<00:04:06.000> plagued<00:04:06.870> by<00:04:07.139> having<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.949> look<00:04:08.129> a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
also plagued by having this to look a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.550 
also plagued by having this to look a
nice

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
nice

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.650 
nice
and<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:08.980> really<00:04:09.190> frustrates<00:04:09.730> me<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.450> when<00:04:10.600> I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
and it really frustrates me so when I

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.120 
and it really frustrates me so when I
put<00:04:10.840> something<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:11.740> it<00:04:11.980> just

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
put something like this on it just

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.250 
put something like this on it just
instantly<00:04:12.610> feels<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.390> much<00:04:13.540> better<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.959> feel

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
instantly feels so much better I feel

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.140 
instantly feels so much better I feel
like<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.650> stand<00:04:14.830> up<00:04:15.010> straighter<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.670> feel

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
like I can stand up straighter I feel

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.970 
like I can stand up straighter I feel
like<00:04:16.359> my<00:04:16.570> back<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:17.109> more<00:04:17.230> supported<00:04:17.829> and

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
like my back is more supported and

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.120 
like my back is more supported and
overall<00:04:18.609> it's<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.180> great<00:04:19.570> feeling<00:04:20.130> they

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
overall it's just a great feeling they

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.820 
overall it's just a great feeling they
also<00:04:21.400> did<00:04:21.850> these<00:04:22.480> great<00:04:22.780> side<00:04:23.080> stays<00:04:23.470> on<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
also did these great side stays on the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.950 
also did these great side stays on the
back<00:04:23.980> as<00:04:24.160> well<00:04:24.400> now<00:04:24.940> because<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.450> design<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
back as well now because the design is a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.750 
back as well now because the design is a
little<00:04:26.290> wide<00:04:26.500> for<00:04:26.860> me<00:04:27.010> my<00:04:27.160> side<00:04:27.430> stay<00:04:27.639> is

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
little wide for me my side stay is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.580 
little wide for me my side stay is
hitting<00:04:28.000> me<00:04:28.120> way<00:04:28.300> far<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.810> back<00:04:28.990> but<00:04:29.560> I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
hitting me way far in the back but I

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740 
hitting me way far in the back but I
actually<00:04:29.830> do<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.580> when<00:04:31.180> four<00:04:31.330> busts<00:04:31.540> Fras

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
actually do like when four busts Fras

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.150 
actually do like when four busts Fras
have<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.200> side<00:04:32.380> stay<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.650> feel<00:04:32.950> like<00:04:33.040> it

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
have that side stay I feel like it

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.010 
have that side stay I feel like it
provides<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.669> little<00:04:33.910> bit<00:04:34.030> more<00:04:34.150> Anchorage<00:04:34.840> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
provides a little bit more Anchorage and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.500 
provides a little bit more Anchorage and
support<00:04:35.470> especially<00:04:35.770> throughout<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.430> day<00:04:36.610> so

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
support especially throughout the day so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.320 
support especially throughout the day so
I<00:04:37.540> do<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.880> lace<00:04:40.090> is

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330

I do like that I like that the lace is
really<00:04:40.540> soft<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:41.140> very<00:04:41.169> comfortable<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.160> mean

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
really soft it's very comfortable I mean

hope<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:55.150> in<00:04:55.390> future<00:04:55.810> iterations<00:04:56.080> maybe

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
hope that in future iterations maybe

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.920

they'll tweak the fit a little bit so

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.960 
they'll tweak the fit a little bit so
that<00:04:58.960> maybe<00:04:59.290> it's<00:04:59.590> just<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.280> little<00:05:00.460> deeper

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
that maybe it's just a little deeper
