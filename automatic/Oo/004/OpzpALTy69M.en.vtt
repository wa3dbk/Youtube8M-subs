weapons and actually enjoy the game a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.410 
weapons and actually enjoy the game a
little<00:00:45.470> bit<00:00:45.680> more<00:00:45.739> because<00:00:46.550> using<00:00:46.790> guns<00:00:47.210> such

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
little bit more because using guns such

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.080 
little bit more because using guns such

very similar with a red laser so for the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
very similar with a red laser so for the
attachments<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:45.890> chose<00:01:46.130> foregrip<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.270> stock

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
attachments I chose foregrip the stock

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.810 
attachments I chose foregrip the stock
attachment<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.469> then<00:01:48.679> I<00:01:48.710> chose<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.340> Tangut

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
attachment and then I chose the Tangut

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.240 
attachment and then I chose the Tangut
enhancer<00:01:50.509> because<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.079> wanted<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.649> see<00:01:51.979> through

the eyes of the Terminator highlight the
enemies<00:01:54.950> red<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.759> definitely<00:01:56.240> adds<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
enemies red and it definitely adds to

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.649 
actually using this class for our perks
I<00:02:03.829> chose<00:02:04.100> flat<00:02:04.399> jacket<00:02:04.789> for<00:02:04.880> perk<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:05.390> because

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
I chose flat jacket for perk one because

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.599 
I chose flat jacket for perk one because
of<00:02:05.780> course<00:02:05.810> you're<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> metal<00:02:06.590> soldier<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
of course you're a metal soldier and you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.639 
of course you're a metal soldier and you
want<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.999> withstand<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.690> lot<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:09.050> grenades<00:02:09.229> and

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
want to withstand a lot of grenades and

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.040 
want to withstand a lot of grenades and
not<00:02:10.039> be<00:02:10.190> able<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.550> dive<00:02:10.759> or<00:02:10.940> perk<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.420> blind<00:02:11.810> eye

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
not be able to dive or perk to blind eye

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.020 
not be able to dive or perk to blind eye
because<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.650> thought<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.430> kill<00:02:13.670> streaks

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
because I thought that the kill streaks

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.030 
because I thought that the kill streaks
may<00:02:14.270> be<00:02:14.420> blocked<00:02:14.780> from<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.170> enemy<00:02:15.620> because

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
may be blocked from the enemy because

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.700 
may be blocked from the enemy because
maybe<00:02:16.580> you've<00:02:16.760> got<00:02:16.940> some<00:02:17.150> kind<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.540> weird

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
maybe you've got some kind of weird

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.110 
maybe you've got some kind of weird
tracking<00:02:18.710> system<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.460> or<00:02:19.670> something<00:02:20.090> like

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
tracking system on you or something like

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.960 
tracking system on you or something like
that<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.319> perk<00:02:21.530> 3<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.860> chose<00:02:22.370> toughness

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that and for perk 3 I chose toughness

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.309 
that and for perk 3 I chose toughness
because<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.630> course<00:02:23.870> you're<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.080> machine

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
because of course you're a machine

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.420 
because of course you're a machine
you're<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.069> find

now moving on to score streaks this is
definitely<00:03:02.209> where<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.599> got<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.230> little<00:03:03.590> bit

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739

and<00:03:10.400> AI<00:03:10.790> know<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.329> reason<00:03:11.689> for<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:11.959> is

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and AI know the reason for this is

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.409 
and AI know the reason for this is
because<00:03:12.409> quite<00:03:12.859> simply<00:03:12.919> I<00:03:13.549> didn't<00:03:13.939> want<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.329> be

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
drone I wanted to be walking around the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.559 
drone I wanted to be walking around the
map<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:19.250> another<00:03:19.609> kill<00:03:19.819> streak<00:03:20.120> which<00:03:20.359> is

something<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.889> wasn't<00:03:25.250> sure<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.519> ports<00:03:26.000> I

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
something that I wasn't sure on ports I

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.759 
something that I wasn't sure on ports I
just<00:03:26.540> thought<00:03:26.689> to<00:03:26.870> myself<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.469> are

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
just thought to myself you know you are

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.550 
just thought to myself you know you are
a<00:03:27.799> big<00:03:28.129> dog<00:03:28.599> terminator<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.139> course<00:03:30.379> when

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
a big dog terminator and of course when

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.050 
a big dog terminator and of course when
you've<00:03:30.680> got<00:03:30.889> this<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.370> amber<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.879> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
you've got this and in amber of the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.030 
you've got this and in amber of the
Goliath<00:03:32.479> you're<00:03:32.959> definitely<00:03:33.260> going<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.709> be<00:03:33.859> an

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
Goliath you're definitely going to be an

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.430 
Goliath you're definitely going to be an
even<00:03:34.220> more<00:03:34.400> beefed<00:03:34.879> up<00:03:35.060> terminator<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.900> for

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
even more beefed up terminator and for

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.830 
even more beefed up terminator and for
the<00:03:36.560> modules<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:37.879> decided<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.510> go<00:03:38.659> for

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
the modules on that I decided to go for

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.719 
the modules on that I decided to go for
the<00:03:38.930> homing<00:03:39.319> rockets<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:39.949> the<00:03:40.250> regular
