did<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:39.360> fabricated<00:03:40.360> some<00:03:40.600> lexan

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
did here is we fabricated some lexan

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.050 
did here is we fabricated some lexan
rods<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.739> bent<00:03:41.950> them<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.370> there<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.790> also

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
rods and bent them in there and also

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.080 
rods and bent them in there and also
backlit<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.900> with<00:03:44.050> some<00:03:44.260> red<00:03:44.440> LEDs<00:03:44.920> also<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
backlit it with some red LEDs also so it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.600 
backlit it with some red LEDs also so it
shines<00:03:46.330> real<00:03:46.690> nice<00:03:46.950> also<00:03:47.950> did<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> halos

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
shines real nice also did the halos

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.990 
shines real nice also did the halos
inside<00:03:49.150> their<00:03:49.390> red<00:03:49.630> LEDs<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.400> also<00:03:51.400> red<00:03:51.610> LEDs

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
inside their red LEDs and also red LEDs

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.520 
inside their red LEDs and also red LEDs
right<00:03:52.269> there<00:03:52.480> let<00:03:52.690> me<00:03:52.720> turn<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.470> can

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.830 

it's<00:04:01.240> pretty<00:04:01.510> wild<00:04:01.660> right<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:03.520> could<00:04:03.850> that's

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
it's pretty wild right that could that's

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.840 
it's pretty wild right that could that's
one<00:04:05.170> one-off<00:04:05.680> custom<00:04:05.920> right<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:06.550> no<00:04:06.760> one

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
one one-off custom right there no one

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.110 
one one-off custom right there no one
else<00:04:07.090> has<00:04:07.150> got<00:04:07.390> that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.530

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
and then I'll turn the cutouts on here

00:04:17.350 --> 00:05:10.680 
and then I'll turn the cutouts on here
with<00:04:17.500> throw<00:04:17.620> some<00:04:17.889> light

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.060
