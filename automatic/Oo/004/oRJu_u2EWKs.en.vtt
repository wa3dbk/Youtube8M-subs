00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
you try to create some space so you can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.460 
you try to create some space so you can
then<00:01:41.710> think<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.890> maneuver<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.310> do<00:01:44.350> if<00:01:45.350> you're

not<00:01:45.619> coming<00:01:45.950> from<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.220> coherent<00:01:46.610> space<00:01:47.679> that's

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
not coming from a coherent space that's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.279 
not coming from a coherent space that's
why<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:48.950> don't<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.700> know<00:01:49.729> with<00:01:49.940> every<00:01:50.210> group<00:01:50.630> we

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
why I don't you know with every group we

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.680 
why I don't you know with every group we
