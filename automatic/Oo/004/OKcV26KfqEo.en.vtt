don't review Nendoroids and the second
one<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.530> completely<00:00:19.950> done<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.280> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
one is this is completely done in a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.350 
one is this is completely done in a
different<00:00:20.910> way

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
different way

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.050 
different way
my<00:00:21.720> usual<00:00:22.080> method<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.500> takes<00:00:22.770> too<00:00:23.430> long<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
my usual method just takes too long and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.840 
my usual method just takes too long and
a<00:00:24.360> lot<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> videos<00:00:25.530> that<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.770> work<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.640> do

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
a lot of the videos that I work on or do

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.180 
a lot of the videos that I work on or do
I<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.660> entirely<00:00:28.020> finished<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
I don't get entirely finished so this is

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.040 
I don't get entirely finished so this is
kind<00:00:29.430> of<00:00:29.490> an<00:00:29.640> off-the-cuff<00:00:30.180> faster<00:00:30.930> way<00:00:31.020> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
kind of an off-the-cuff faster way of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
kind of an off-the-cuff faster way of
doing<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.440> I'm<00:00:31.530> talking<00:00:31.980> while<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.789> holding

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
doing it I'm talking while I'm holding

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.960 
doing it I'm talking while I'm holding
it<00:00:33.239> usually<00:00:33.629> I<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> voiceover<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.970> that

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
it usually I do a voiceover and that

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000 
it usually I do a voiceover and that
just<00:00:36.180> takes<00:00:36.360> too<00:00:36.510> long<00:00:36.540> there's<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> bunch<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
just takes too long there's a bunch of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.890 
just takes too long there's a bunch of
figma<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> bunch<00:00:39.060> of<00:00:39.180> Gundams<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.780> i've

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900

half-assed<00:01:22.529> way<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.829> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.069> get<00:01:23.189> me

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
half-assed way is going to get me

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.859 
half-assed way is going to get me
through<00:01:23.429> reviews<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.789> lot<00:01:23.939> quicker<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.539> they'll

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
through reviews a lot quicker so they'll

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
through reviews a lot quicker so they'll
be<00:01:24.990> more<00:01:25.170> content<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.579> be<00:01:26.819> still

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
be more content but I will be still

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.269 
be more content but I will be still

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
doing important figma releases and

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.789 
doing important figma releases and
Master<00:01:29.850> Grade<00:01:30.029> releases<00:01:30.569> in<00:01:30.779> the<00:01:31.259> old<00:01:31.439> style

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
Master Grade releases in the old style

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.709 
Master Grade releases in the old style
which<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.310> in-depth<00:01:32.819> has<00:01:33.359> a<00:01:33.389> bit<00:01:33.569> of<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
which is more in-depth has a bit of a

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.589 
which is more in-depth has a bit of a
pattern<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> whatnot<00:01:35.459> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.969> like<00:01:36.569> I

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
pattern to it and whatnot this is like I

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.419 
pattern to it and whatnot this is like I
said<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.409> half-assed<00:01:37.829> version<00:01:38.099> I

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
said this is a more half-assed version I

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.010 
said this is a more half-assed version I
may<00:01:38.819> miss<00:01:38.999> a<00:01:39.029> lot<00:01:39.179> of<00:01:39.240> things<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.569> it<00:01:39.659> won't<00:01:39.840> be

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
may miss a lot of things and it won't be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
may miss a lot of things and it won't be
as<00:01:40.139> in-depth<00:01:40.529> just<00:01:40.859> too<00:01:40.950> quick<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.279> gloss

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
as in-depth just too quick your gloss

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
as in-depth just too quick your gloss
over<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.119> figure<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.599> that's<00:01:43.079> enough<00:01:43.319> about

I'm looking at the accessories in a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.880 
I'm looking at the accessories in a
little<00:03:51.690> while<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.170> legs<00:03:52.380> here<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.769> move

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
little while the legs here can move

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.039 
little while the legs here can move
around<00:03:53.160> quite<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.730> bit<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.150> they<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.570> also<00:03:54.840> be

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
around quite a bit and they can also be

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.350 
around quite a bit and they can also be
twisted<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:55.829> at<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.400> point<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> legs

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
twisted here at this point so the legs

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.270 
twisted here at this point so the legs
can<00:03:57.570> move<00:03:57.600> outwards<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.350> that

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
can move outwards like that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.820 
can move outwards like that
and<00:04:00.550> in<00:04:01.000> words<00:04:01.210> like<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:01.630> but<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> neck<00:04:02.710> you

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
and in words like that but the neck you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.380 
and in words like that but the neck you
can<00:04:02.980> move<00:04:03.100> around<00:04:03.280> quite<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.850> bit<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.270> move

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
can move around quite a bit I can move

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.120 
can move around quite a bit I can move
up<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:04.780> down<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.440> pull<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.740> joint<00:04:05.950> out<00:04:06.070> a

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
up and down if you pull the joint out a

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.040 
up and down if you pull the joint out a
little<00:04:06.310> bit<00:04:06.490> more<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:07.270> can<00:04:07.300> hide<00:04:07.600> that<00:04:07.630> from

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
little bit more you can hide that from

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.620 
little bit more you can hide that from
specific<00:04:08.920> angles<00:04:09.250> if<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.460> wanted<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.510> way

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
specific angles if you wanted to the way

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.620 
specific angles if you wanted to the way
it<00:04:10.720> pops<00:04:10.900> up<00:04:11.080> like<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.360> also<00:04:13.360> it<00:04:13.540> can

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
it pops up like that and also it can

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.330 
it pops up like that and also it can
rotate<00:04:13.780> all<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.170> way<00:04:14.380> around<00:04:14.740> so<00:04:14.980> that's

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
rotate all the way around so that's

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.830 
rotate all the way around so that's
pretty<00:04:15.610> much<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.820> for<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> figure<00:04:16.450> let's<00:04:16.720> have

because<00:06:10.460> it<00:06:10.730> has<00:06:10.820> a<00:06:10.850> few<00:06:11.090> moving<00:06:11.270> parts<00:06:11.420> it

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
because it has a few moving parts it

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.020 
because it has a few moving parts it
moves<00:06:12.050> at<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.260> silver<00:06:12.680> button<00:06:12.890> there<00:06:13.190> side<00:06:13.910> to

moves at the silver button there side to
side<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:15.140> can<00:06:15.260> see<00:06:15.290> in<00:06:15.500> here<00:06:15.680> there's<00:06:15.890> a<00:06:15.920> bit

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
side you can see in here there's a bit

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.770 
side you can see in here there's a bit
of<00:06:16.130> a<00:06:16.190> joint<00:06:16.460> so<00:06:16.670> that<00:06:16.700> can<00:06:17.000> move<00:06:17.120> up<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.600> down

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
of a joint so that can move up and down

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.800 
of a joint so that can move up and down
quite<00:06:18.620> a<00:06:18.650> bit<00:06:18.890> and<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.940> are<00:06:20.060> these<00:06:20.150> side<00:06:20.450> parts

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
quite a bit and so are these side parts

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.110 
quite a bit and so are these side parts
here<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.200> you<00:06:21.470> can<00:06:21.590> see<00:06:21.740> in<00:06:21.980> there<00:06:22.370> that<00:06:22.580> these

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
here and you can see in there that these

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.640 
here and you can see in there that these
are<00:06:23.270> also<00:06:23.570> attached<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.960> some<00:06:24.170> small<00:06:24.440> ball

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
are also attached to some small ball

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.470 
are also attached to some small ball
joints<00:06:25.070> so<00:06:25.220> there's<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.460> lot<00:06:25.730> of<00:06:25.940> moving<00:06:26.240> parts

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
joints so there's a lot of moving parts

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.590 
joints so there's a lot of moving parts
on<00:06:26.720> here<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.920> majority<00:06:28.430> of<00:06:28.460> it<00:06:28.910> moves<00:06:29.150> so

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
on here the majority of it moves so

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.410 
on here the majority of it moves so
that's<00:06:29.750> pretty<00:06:29.960> cool<00:06:30.170> and<00:06:30.730> there<00:06:31.730> is<00:06:31.880> what<00:06:32.330> the

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
little square peg in here and there it

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.510 
little square peg in here and there it
is<00:07:11.960> attached<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:12.590> I<00:07:12.620> have<00:07:12.770> to<00:07:12.919> say<00:07:13.010> that<00:07:13.160> spin

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
is attached and I have to say that spin

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.870 
is attached and I have to say that spin
is<00:07:13.760> awesome<00:07:14.330> this<00:07:15.200> also<00:07:15.620> has<00:07:15.740> a<00:07:15.770> joint<00:07:16.100> in<00:07:16.400> here

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
is awesome this also has a joint in here

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.150 
is awesome this also has a joint in here
so<00:07:17.600> that<00:07:17.720> means<00:07:17.870> this<00:07:18.050> is<00:07:18.110> actually<00:07:18.410> movable

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
so that means this is actually movable

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.190 
so that means this is actually movable
you<00:07:19.430> can<00:07:19.580> twist<00:07:19.760> this<00:07:19.940> around<00:07:20.090> to<00:07:20.540> alter<00:07:20.930> the

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.200 
you can twist this around to alter the

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.680 
you can twist this around to alter the
angle<00:07:21.229> of<00:07:21.680> it<00:07:21.830> so<00:07:22.550> it<00:07:22.970> look<00:07:23.180> like<00:07:23.360> a<00:07:23.390> device

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
angle of it so it look like a device

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.600 
angle of it so it look like a device
coming<00:07:23.930> from<00:07:24.140> different<00:07:24.350> directions<00:07:24.610> so

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
coming from different directions so

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.980 
coming from different directions so
that's<00:07:25.790> the<00:07:25.940> last<00:07:26.090> accessory<00:07:26.419> and<00:07:26.840> that's

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
that's the last accessory and that's

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.230 
that's the last accessory and that's
pretty<00:07:27.200> much<00:07:27.380> it<00:07:27.620> so<00:07:27.800> that's<00:07:28.790> it<00:07:29.000> for<00:07:29.150> my

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
pretty much it so that's it for my

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.480
