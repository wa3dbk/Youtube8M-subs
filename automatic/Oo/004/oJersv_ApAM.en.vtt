00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 how am i nicolás firma de supra 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.120
 pixel and today I'm going to show you how to give 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 account if a phone bought in the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 outside be Chinese or any other 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.340
 country will work with data 3g 4g or 2g 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.970
 or directly with mobile networks in your 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 very important country and well I will give 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 examples with argentina how to take 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.660
 a country as an example does not mean that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 this method does not work for others 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 countries so if you're from Colombia or from 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 venezuela or from spain does not matter 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 method is exactly the same only 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 they are going to change some values ​​that is what 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.090
 that I am going to teach you to obtain because 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 with those same values they will be able to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.660
 learn to know if your phone that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.430
 They want to buy in China or they are going to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.780
 import or that they are going to travel 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 they will buy it outside if it is going to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.600
 work in your country so let's start 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.610
 first and foremost you have to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 know are the radio bands of your 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 country are the bands gsm gs m are going to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.289
 google and look for frequencies or gsm bands 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.719
 of x country, for example, frequencies 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.070
 gsm from argentina then surely 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
 they will leave the wikipedia page in 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.769
 where are you going to tell them exactly which 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.359
 are the bands 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 this Argentine case but obviously it 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:10.560
 leave the other countries will be from another 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.039
 logical country then what do they have 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 what to do 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.649
 write down those values ​​for example the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.409
 of argentina are for 2g and 3g are those of 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.829
 850 megahertz and 1,900 megahertz 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.920
 and then the 4g is the thousand band 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.450
 700 megahertz ie these are data 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.539
 from Argentina those from another country 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 logically they can vary but let's take 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.000
 as a basis these examples ie 850 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.739
 thousand 900 and then 1700 then by 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
 example let's say we're going to go find 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.950
 a phone to china or that they are going to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 send to China or they will bring it from 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.860
 any other country then in the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.500
 product description are going to have to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.420
 see how it works with 2g and 3g networks 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.659
 for example if it says 2 that 850 thousand 900 and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 then the 3g says 850 2900 then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 they will be able to use your phone to 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.679
 calls messages and also for 2g data 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.200
 and 3g if those of 2 that are those of 850 and the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.360
 of 1900 and those of 3 that are different 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.679
 then they will be able to have a signal with 12 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.119
 but they will not be able to use 3 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.879
 for example, it can also happen that 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 have a signal with 2k and 4g and with 3g it is not 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.689
 a whole combination but they always have 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 that match does not matter if the value 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:22.659
 is close to god and they have 850 in their 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.239
 country and they look for a product that says 800 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.739
 in 802 800 us 50 that because it's 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.030
 close will work so have them in 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.310
 realize that they are not going to directly 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.530
 work has to be exactly the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.120
 same number now let's say they do not go 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.859
 to buy a Chinese phone even if such 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.879
 once they have all the information there and that 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.560
 simply if they want to buy a 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.900
 phone a local an operator what 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.939
 let's say let's not get united 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.010
 or in any country of europe then 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.650
 what's going to have to be fixed yes or yes 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.750
 the model of the product because there 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.129
 different phone models that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 they are exactly the same so 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.669
 less in what is hardware simply 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.750
 work with other radio bands 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.549
 because there are simply other frequencies 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.469
 in all the world that are with those who 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.930
 they handle the telephony then to know 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.430
 the model simply go to the page 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.870
 where they will buy it if it is a 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.299
 operator has to have a web page 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.659
 and look for the model or else the easiest 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.400
 it's going to gsm arena dotcom whose link 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.690
 I'm going to leave you a description below and 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.160
 they look for the no 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 the phone does not look for my hand for example 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.810
 let's say the motor or the motorcycle then 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.310
 they look for motorola moto xy then it will appear 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.110
 a list with a lot of data 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 technicians about the entire phone in 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.320
 general and also generally at 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.640
 beginning of the whole list is going to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.410
 say all available models 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.240
 there are thousand 30 x 3 thousand 31 x term 32 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.920
 they are three different models of the same 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.960
 product that simply work with 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.210
 other frequency bands then it 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.680
 they will be able to fix that model and 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.660
 obviously in which countries are you 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.010
 continents are sold with this by 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.840
 Of course you will be able to compare 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.600
 frequencies that I already told you now there are 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 another method that is much simpler but 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.780
 that will obviously work only 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.520
 Original official flower count is 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.900
 say if they are going to look for a Chinese phone 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.820
 then they will have to use the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.410
 method that I explained to them at the beginning that 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.970
 simply compare the frequencies with 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.280
 those of your country 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.780
 the method this is much simpler and is 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.800
 directly enter a page that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.360
 I will also leave you below 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.900
 description called will my phone 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.130
 work point net a simple imagine for 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.960
 what is the site with the name already 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.269
 they would have to deciphering speech they go to 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.039
 site go in and follow the steps 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.009
 for example we are on the site we are going to 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.389
 choose the motorola brand after 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.930
 we choose for example the model in this 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.729
 case the second generation moto x 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.300
 let's choose the zoom in model by 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.280
 example the x of 1097 let's say any 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.379
 it does not matter and we will also choose the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.000
 country we are going to choose argentina and we are going to 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.889
 choose for example that will work the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.900
 Argentine monitor then we play in the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.280
 search button and we will see that the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.340
 results are not going to say that they are going to 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.009
 work with the three networks 2g 3g and 4g 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.990
 because the bands coincide 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.060
 but it will decide some simply 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.039
 good not agree but good steps 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.800
 they are very very simple really following 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.569
 these steps are going to be able to realize if 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.240
 your phone or the phone that are going to 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.409
 buy will work in x country or not or 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.409
 if it's going to work on some frequencies 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.780
 yes and in others not so with that they have 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.000
 all the information there is no more science 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.710
 no more magic than that if this video 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.810
 served please by sharing with friends 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.060
 that if they carry the outside or relatives or 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.530
 15 to if you want to know if your phone 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.900
 to work or not because the truth is 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.520
 a question that all of them ask me 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.410
 the days so if someone else also 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.990
 when you do not stick this link to this 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.910
 video and the technical problem is finished 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.100
 the signature of another pixel and see you in 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.340
 next videos 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.340
 zurita 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.340
 for 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.230
 to
