other<00:02:03.520> classes<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.149> usually<00:02:04.450> i'm<00:02:04.539> running

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
other classes so usually i'm running

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.940 
other classes so usually i'm running
around<00:02:05.049> i<00:02:05.110> don't<00:02:05.140> get<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> watch<00:02:05.649> very<00:02:05.829> many

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
around i don't get to watch very many

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.040 
around i don't get to watch very many
races<00:02:06.429> but<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.030> really<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.390> pretty<00:02:07.570> cool<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
races but it really is pretty cool the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.600 
races but it really is pretty cool the
sound<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.830> planes<00:02:09.190> when<00:02:09.369> they're<00:02:09.489> going

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
sound of the planes when they're going

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.000 
sound of the planes when they're going
bike<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.450> don't<00:02:10.660> hear<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:10.959> anywhere<00:02:11.830> else

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
bike you don't hear that anywhere else

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.460 
bike you don't hear that anywhere else
because<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.700> not<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.880> normal<00:02:13.200> occurrence<00:02:14.200> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
because it's not a normal occurrence to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.199 
because it's not a normal occurrence to
be<00:02:14.560> flying<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.069> fast<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.730> close<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
be flying this fast this is close to

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.199 
be flying this fast this is close to
people<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.530> pretty<00:02:18.220> unique<00:02:18.340> since<00:02:19.030> we're

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
people so it's pretty unique since we're

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.809 
people so it's pretty unique since we're
doing<00:02:19.540> outstanding<00:02:20.410> all<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.430> great

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
a few years actually we're we were one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.850 
a few years actually we're we were one
at<00:02:49.450> four<00:02:49.660> years<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:50.080> have<00:02:50.200> most<00:02:50.440> victories<00:02:50.830> in

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860

at four years we have most victories in
sport<00:02:51.280> class<00:02:51.459> I've<00:02:52.090> done<00:02:52.330> some<00:02:52.540> major<00:02:52.750> changes

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
sport class I've done some major changes

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
sport class I've done some major changes
with<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.470> plan<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.860> year<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.910> only<00:02:55.060> thing

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
with the plan this year the only thing

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150 
with the plan this year the only thing
is<00:02:55.209> just<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.450> lot<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.660> teething<00:02:55.810> things<00:02:56.230> that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
is just a lot of teething things that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
is just a lot of teething things that
each<00:02:57.760> year<00:02:58.030> we<00:02:58.180> would<00:02:58.270> build<00:02:58.450> upon<00:02:58.780> what<00:02:58.810> we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
each year we would build upon what we

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.140 
each year we would build upon what we
learn<00:02:59.260> from<00:02:59.290> the<00:03:00.040> past<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.850> new

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
learn from the past but we have a new

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.210 
learn from the past but we have a new
engine<00:03:01.420> different<00:03:02.080> type<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> engine<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.920> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
engine different type of engine and a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.650 
engine different type of engine and a
different<00:03:03.610> settings<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.510> been<00:03:04.630> a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
different settings so it's been a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660 
different settings so it's been a
learning<00:03:04.810> curve<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.170> us<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:06.130> have<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.640> of

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
learning curve for us we have a lot of

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.610 
learning curve for us we have a lot of
horsepower<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.510> getting<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.320> apply<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
horsepower but getting it to apply to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.050 
horsepower but getting it to apply to
what<00:03:08.860> we<00:03:08.950> want<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.459> year's<00:03:09.670> bit<00:03:09.880> tough

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
what we want to do this year's bit tough

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.360 
what we want to do this year's bit tough
our<00:03:10.390> limitations<00:03:10.959> right<00:03:11.170> now<00:03:11.350> what<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.340> have

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
our limitations right now what we have

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.070 
our limitations right now what we have
really<00:03:12.700> push<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.060> hard<00:03:13.090> as<00:03:13.300> we<00:03:13.360> buy<00:03:13.570> tell

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
really push it as hard as we buy tell

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.460 
really push it as hard as we buy tell
you<00:03:14.140> truth<00:03:14.519> we<00:03:15.519> normally<00:03:15.970> would<00:03:16.360> pull<00:03:16.540> 65<00:03:17.019> 70

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
you truth we normally would pull 65 70

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.590 
you truth we normally would pull 65 70
inches<00:03:17.769> but<00:03:18.310> with<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.519> geared<00:03:18.760> engine<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.420> can

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
inches but with the geared engine we can

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.570 
inches but with the geared engine we can
actually<00:03:20.050> pull<00:03:20.410> back<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.220> boost

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
actually pull back on the on the boost

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.210 
actually pull back on the on the boost
which<00:03:22.150> was<00:03:22.390> nicer<00:03:22.959> for<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> intricacy<00:03:23.680> rpm

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
which was nicer for the intricacy rpm

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.070 
which was nicer for the intricacy rpm
everything's<00:03:24.519> running<00:03:24.700> higher<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.690> we've

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
everything's running higher so we've

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.690 
everything's running higher so we've
been<00:03:26.170> taking<00:03:26.350> little<00:03:26.709> baby<00:03:26.890> steps<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.489> see

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
been taking little baby steps to see

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.090 
been taking little baby steps to see
what<00:03:28.090> manifold<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.930> wants<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.350> do<00:03:29.500> there's

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
what manifold it wants to do there's

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100 
what manifold it wants to do there's
good<00:03:30.310> pilots<00:03:30.760> out<00:03:30.910> here<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.420> see<00:03:31.600> some

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
good pilots out here you see some

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.360 
good pilots out here you see some
awesome<00:03:32.530> flying<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.100> also<00:03:33.220> a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
awesome flying but it's also a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.750 
awesome flying but it's also a
technology<00:03:34.030> risk<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.430> order<00:03:36.670> to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
technology risk and it's in order to

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.460 
technology risk and it's in order to
pass<00:03:36.910> someone<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.390> have<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.660> 15<00:03:38.049> miles<00:03:38.260> an

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
pass someone you have to be 15 miles an

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.590 
pass someone you have to be 15 miles an
hour<00:03:38.500> faster<00:03:38.910> even<00:03:39.910> if<00:03:40.090> it's<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> greatest

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
hour faster even if it's the greatest

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.199 
hour faster even if it's the greatest
pilot<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.260> it's<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.010> interesting<00:03:42.310> see<00:03:42.820> what

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
pilot so it's it's interesting see what

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.970 
pilot so it's it's interesting see what
everyone<00:03:43.540> does<00:03:43.690> each<00:03:43.959> year<00:03:44.260> we<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.769> very

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
everyone does each year we have very
