00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
 look 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 hello friends of youtube here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 we are once again with a recipe very 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.309
 simple and economical this time we are going to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.410
 to make arepas but sweet and we're just going to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.580
 need precooked cornmeal 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.739
 that I have already told you in other 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.019
 occasions that can be obtained 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.390
 any brand in supermarkets 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.750
 but in this case, I, that of all the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.890
 life flour bread 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.390
 a pinch of salt and a lot of sugar now 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.390
 I'm going to show you the procedure 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.700
 very well we're still here let's start 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.760
 putting a little salt 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.340
 remember that as it is sweet arepas not 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.030
 you can exaggerate a lot with salt a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 little yes 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 and we put it basic 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.960
 to sugar let's try to put 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 enough stir 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.180
 that's why it's called sweet cookies 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.690
 after having verified that it is 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.670
 dissolved all the sugar 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.330
 let's start putting the flour 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.330
 slowly 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.970
 we are putting flour little by little and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 stirring so that we get a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.720
 fairly homogenous mass and that there 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.000
 lumps me in this case I used more 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.890
 or less half a liter of water because it's going to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.820
 depend on how many people have 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.070
 guests at home 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.320
 you know what 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.619
 while more people so much more 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.619
 Water 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.890
 very well this is the consistency that I 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.519
 I want you to get that still 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.980
 it's quite creamy and squishy but 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.960
 after letting it stand for one or 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.030
 two minutes you will see what 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.850
 the mass more as we want it 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.709
 As you can see, the dough has caught the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.190
 consistency that we wanted is a bit 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.070
 harder more moldable 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.700
 then we will start doing 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.709
 balls 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 and with the help of a little water 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.600
 we will always wet our hands to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:56.160
 make sure we do not break 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.850
 we wet the hands we go around and 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.850
 we crush 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 this time we're going to try to get that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 the arepas are very very thin 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.250
 because being sweet and having contact 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.420
 With the oil the pumps are going to pumps 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.940
 then here we already have one 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.130
 and so we will continue doing until 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.530
 get all we want 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.360
 well here we keep doing together 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.800
 sweet cookies very thin now 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.990
 we are going to have a pot already a pan that 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.240
 be of a very small measure with 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.950
 a lot of oil because it's the one that's going 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.420
 to help get her to be 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 moving now I show it 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.030
 as you will see I have used a pan 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.550
 small and has a lot of oil oil 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.610
 sunflower 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.490
 and we are going to put our arepa that no longer 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.720
 I'm hot 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.430
 I recommend them 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.980
 that always with the skimmer help 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.550
 touching her they tap her so 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.470
 side to help her get 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.780
 what we want, look up, messi 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.780
 already sweet our sweet arepa 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.389
 we wait a little 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.660
 we hope a little never gets the 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.280
 back and when we consider that it is already 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.730
 sufficiently golden because 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.710
 remember that this top layer is 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.410
 just a skin chair that goes up 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.800
 how important it cooks the bottom and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.740
 being so thin because it is already cooked and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.740
 here we have our first sweet arepa 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.259
 remember that the arepas can 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 fill with what you prefer arepas 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.810
 that I have shown them in the other video that 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.250
 it was salad stuffed with ham that 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.080
 I'm always remembering that they could not 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.199
 fill in what they have left over from 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.539
 any meat bite whatever 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.240
 these are usually put grated cheese 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.720
 above but in this case we're going to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.990
 put a slice of yellow cheese and 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.940
 we hope that it melts equality that 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.800
 love good and remember
