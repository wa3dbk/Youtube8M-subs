written at the top of the page and it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:59.230 
written at the top of the page and it
sounds<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:46.660> back<00:02:47.660> down<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:59.090> you'll

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
sounds like this back down if you'll

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.630 
sounds like this back down if you'll
notice<00:02:59.780> on<00:02:59.960> each<00:03:00.110> lick<00:03:00.440> there's<00:03:00.710> four

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
notice on each lick there's four

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910 
notice on each lick there's four
different<00:03:01.670> lines<00:03:02.390> or<00:03:02.780> phrases<00:03:03.080> there's<00:03:03.860> a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
different lines or phrases there's a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.720 
different lines or phrases there's a
line<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.270> align<00:03:05.270> be<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.870> second<00:03:06.470> line<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.190> then

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
line a align be a second line a and then

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.350 
line a align be a second line a and then
what's<00:03:08.030> called<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.360> tag<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.730> each<00:03:11.150> of

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
what's called the tag and so each of

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.090 
what's called the tag and so each of
those<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.660> be<00:03:11.810> sort<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.320> divided<00:03:12.770> into<00:03:12.950> its

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
those can be sort of divided into its

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.820 
those can be sort of divided into its
own<00:03:13.220> lick<00:03:13.490> or<00:03:13.670> put<00:03:14.180> together<00:03:14.270> it's<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:15.530> long

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
own lick or put together it's one long

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.500
