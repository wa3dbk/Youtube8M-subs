tranches

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.400 

this<00:00:48.810> is<00:00:48.990> what<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.860> far<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.260> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this is what I have so far and you can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
this is what I have so far and you can
see<00:00:52.560> I<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.920> roller<00:00:53.220> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> end<00:00:53.850> because

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
see I have a roller on the end because

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.310 
see I have a roller on the end because
my<00:00:54.950> natural<00:00:55.950> hair<00:00:56.330> holds<00:00:57.330> really<00:00:57.540> good<00:00:57.900> with

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
my natural hair holds really good with

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
my natural hair holds really good with
the<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.559> strand<00:00:58.980> twists<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.730> curliness

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the two strand twists all this curliness

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
the two strand twists all this curliness
holds<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.720> good<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> gets<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.400> my

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
holds really good but when it gets to my

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.850 
holds really good but when it gets to my
relaxed<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.480> ends<00:01:03.930> never<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> hold

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
relaxed and the ends never want to hold

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.850 
relaxed and the ends never want to hold
so<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.910> about<00:01:06.000> five<00:01:06.420> minutes<00:01:06.780> since<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.530> wet

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so for about five minutes since it's wet

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
so for about five minutes since it's wet
I<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.280> let<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.520> dry<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.660> roller<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I just let it dry and the roller and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.250 
I just let it dry and the roller and
that<00:01:10.380> usually<00:01:10.590> helps<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.790> ends<00:01:11.970> curl<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that usually helps the ends curl up so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.240 
that usually helps the ends curl up so
all<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.000> small<00:01:15.720> section<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
all I do is take a small section this is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.300 
all I do is take a small section this is
a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.520> wider<00:01:20.820> than<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.240> usually<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.720> them

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.980 

there<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.180> i'm<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> clip

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.410 

and<00:01:50.880> move<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.959> down<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.459> i<00:01:53.580> take<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:54.060> tiny

it on i divided into two parts and
simply<00:02:03.599> twist<00:02:05.000> twist<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> they're<00:02:08.610> very

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
simply twist twist so they're very

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.589 
simply twist twist so they're very
simple<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.990> easy<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.430> it's
