00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.640
 hello dear friends again with you zombies 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.650
 rus 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.200
 Today we start sniper 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.000
 weeks during this week on the channel 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.100
 will come out a few clips that will 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.220
 devoted exclusively to sniper 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.430
 rifles and rifles d and p and this 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.309
 sniper parade opens the real 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.970
 barrett 50 gauge beyond that we 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.430
 today talk about sniper barrett m95 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.649
 sniper rifle with sliding 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 shutter in the bullpup layout which 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.320
 made on the basis of semi-automatic 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.480
 m82 says so in battlefield 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.510
 bad company 2 for the first time this giant 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.870
 deadly power appeared in the battlefield 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.780
 2 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.350
 although originally give planned instead 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.729
 m95 present to us just the same 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.830
 semi-automatic m82 which 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.509
 subsequently appear in a series of games 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.250
 battle 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.710
 m95 was one of the class blocks 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.530
 sniper the same thing was in battlefield 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.510
 bad company 1 but in bad company 2 was 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 presented a completely different system 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.290
 unlock of which took as a basis 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.190
 call of duty modern pumping system 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.220
 warfare 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.950
 in the tree well for the sniper m95 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.720
 occupies the last place is the final 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.930
 unlock for class river 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.970
 I would not say that m95 is the best 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.409
 sniper rifle in my opinion here 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.530
 same sv-98 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.689
 illegal magnum is better and more effective 1 per 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.890
 rate of fire and the second behind the low 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.590
 more drop but why this movie about m95 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.090
 Yes, because I miss the heavy 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.970
 sniper rifles up to m95 real 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.409
 very big 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.450
 clumsy with a very low pace 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.329
 shooting twenty six shots 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.850
 minute piece of iron but that sound with 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.970
 which bullets of 50 gauge fly out 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.640
 incredible effort with which character 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.370
 loads a bullet into the chamber causes 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.280
 pure ecstasy of me is just nice 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.160
 look and unlike battlefield 4 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.020
 owl m82 as a battle pickup 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 feel without 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.910
 h &amp; m 95 although the characteristics of the m95 can be 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.670
 compare jane g or s5 is battlefield 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.180
 4 damage maximum table and minimum 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.710
 55 and unlike the communication head 98 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.570
 increased application distance 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.580
 maximum damage and increased 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.000
 minimum damage but the main chip 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.870
 which gives 50 caliber bullets in bad 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.850
 company 2 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 this is an opportunity to cause damage 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.250
 armored vehicles for helicopters 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.680
 7 to 18 percent for easy 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.330
 armored vehicles 10 percent without 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.580
 fashionable ammo for those who love 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.380
 ride quadrics and jet skis 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.200
 better never at all in my life 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.260
 meet the owner of m95 because 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.180
 if you fall, you will die magnum 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 chuck by the way an optional module for 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.770
 barry it personally i don't use them with this 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.350
 a rifle so for me vanshot on 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.540
 distance of 20 meters just for the eyes 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.160
 inspect the cartridges this distance and go 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.230
 In that 25 30 meters in general, I love this 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.959
 rifle just for its appearance 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.860
 for its massiveness for all these efforts with 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.680
 which is loaded bullets inserted 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.150
 both are just pleased to look at it in 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.080
 difference from the same 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.340
 m 98 bravo of the same m-200 intervention 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.320
 from the same 338 ricon of battlefield 4 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.420
 now a little sniping for me 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.100
 reference is considered to be sniping in 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.170
 battlefield bad company 2 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.570
 many of you may ask why 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.640
 zombie and then probably play a few 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.740
 factors 1 unlike the same 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.070
 battlefield 4 we are not mad 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.860
 the number of casual modules or 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.810
 mechanic we no rangefinders not bipod 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.240
 hybrids of sights not insane 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 the number of multiple sights with us 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.169
 no fat inga 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.109
 and there is no sniping suppression system in bad 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.570
 company 2 requires the skill of caution and 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.550
 understanding a good sniper bad company 2 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.130
 probably like foxes 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.500
 ease bypass any second trap 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.020
 factor is constant change 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.870
 the environment of the bad company 2 card in contrast 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.200
 from battlefield 3 and battlefield 4 being built 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.260
 on the main chip frost byte 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.660
 destructible on all maps about 90 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.910
 percent of shelters do not live long 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.610
 a and some seconds so 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.890
 recon in battlefield bad company 2 more 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.320
 active combatant and not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.570
 like in battlefield 3 or battlefield 4 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.910
 stayed 80 percent of the time 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.960
 the other 20 he just runs to 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.120
 desired position 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.250
 the third factor is vantage points which 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.260
 still missing in battlefield3 very 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.690
 strange days of position that sniper 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.810
 kills with one shot at a distance 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.090
 up to 10-12 meters it is not always in 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 battlefield 4 vanshotov there and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.080
 defense specialization which is not 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.630
 allows it to just be done in 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.200
 battlefield3 i even have a clear reason to find 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.270
 I can not 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.300
 many refer to the above code that first 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.610
 that 2 games but this is wrong because in 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.340
 battlefield bad company 2 over code sometimes 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.230
 gives out such wild pearls for example you 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.780
 can hit the enemy in the head on 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.480
 distances over 60 meters and he doesn't even 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.600
 will take damage he won't even notice how in 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.640
 his head was hit by a 50 caliber bullet and 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.400
 put half the brains on the wall 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.490
 which is behind him it happens before 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.670
 real damage doesn't go away but anyway 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.630
 getting into bad company 2 is easy and convenient 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.710
 and this is an opportunity in my opinion 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.830
 fundamental sniping especially on 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.130
 distances up to 30 meters even with so 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.640
 slow rifle like m95 can be dragged 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.240
 in melee and destroy even the whole 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.860
 squad just the same store for 5 rounds 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.980
 but I think that's all dear friends 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.420
 below write your opinion about sniping in 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.940
 different battlefield games 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.490
 as well as point your favorite sniper 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.470
 rifle in battlefield bad company 2 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.780
 as well as you can subscribe to put 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.640
 Like and repost this video but 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.640
 see you on the battlefield bye
