 shade I chose this and and so 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 you mud about because there is another one there 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.550
 applying different color 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 for outer corner and I pick up a 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.620
 car our tent with a golden shine 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.540
 I chose this and dave drink 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.190
 with a regular eye shadow brush in the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.470
 outer corner of the eye that is the same 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.729
 just used mastic for this and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 you now i go a second time with 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 the same color in my outside style 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 that it is with tvm 776 so that is the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.790
 planned brush and thus brings the same 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 color very gap a tear in defenseless 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.260
 there aren't in my arcade arch either 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.000
 it knows i'm waiting that's the gilliam 755 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 I refuel a very thin line in it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.259
 outer part of my arcade arch 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.290
 I want a matt light brown shade 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.940
 and I chose this one 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 and if I have this or thereon 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.420
 I blur this line on more of it too 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.369
 have themselves planned once I brush your 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.229
 used forwards 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.369
 really in my belly is the eye eye I draw 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.080
 a v shape 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.380
 this does with a very dark brown matte 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.700
 color this is and has one not the same 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.320
 little brush that we have before 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.530
 used that is the do you have things 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.090
 755 and if I do a lot of tea for this 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 I am of course also a blur of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.080
 a very nice gradient but first 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.390
 I have this one more time in this car 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.549
 It was windy so I thought he was great 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.489
 can only with the same place was the colors 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.410
 nice to ask and I will take this gold 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.769
 then will return to the same blind some 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.570
 I also just made medium 776 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.760
 and in a swooping motion I have this 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.440
 gold in exactly in my outermost 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.180
 corner of the eye for a very nice subtle 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.980
 golden shine 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.170
 trade and the pink can something 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.209
 have been swept away so I grab again 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.960
 this light rose hue and again in one 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.610
 patting 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.220
 in the picture is one more time on mine 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.990
 moving eyelid one to the golden shine 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.690
 to accentuate it completely 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.090
 transparent gold pigment to it 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.890
 van mac and the color is called brook and ran 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.420

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.390
 effect and that really my whole 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 inner corner of the eye and I color it 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.770
 I opted for this shade and this one 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350
 mint color really fits really nicely with one 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.910
 golden hues and pink hues and these 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.400
 colors together that enhance own 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.080
 to color only but I have this least 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.600
 times nicely mixed with the wall 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.860
 the entire inside is also a highlight 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.570
 and I do n't really do this just here 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.830
 leaves in the inner part 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.050
 are also moving towards my arcade arch 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.760
 that is also connecting itself with what 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.110
 darker colors 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.090

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.400

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.220
 I had to be really super you can really 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.230
 draw very nice precise lines again 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.270
 and i click you could be again 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.160
 towards the outside of my eye and 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.380
 sign that a big cat eye for 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.450
 a very nice chic glamor effect 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.070
 in the next step is mascara and me 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.110
 use you as always to van 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.310
 snatch effect of max factor 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.860
 and with this I put a number of things 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.270
 peculiar to that my upper lashes and whole 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.580
 subtle layer on my lower lashes 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.169
 you will notice this or less 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.330
 more than finish this eye look completely 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.200
 do I chose to fake eyelashes and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.729
 to bring 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.040
 these are very natural of the eyelashes 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.919
 and opted for new getty from 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.110
 pressure and hopefully they are all over 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.360
 let's go with the family 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.880
 they push wide palette of little cosmac 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.040
 nothing and I opted for the middle 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.690
 and I just have little fun with 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.669
 each other municipality this is really one 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.160
 the bronze color and your above one is one 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.450
 soft pink color with the golden luster and 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.680
 that comes very much over with the 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.750
 colors that I have applied to my 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.849
 eyes and this week in a dabbing 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.559
 just move on my teacher one and 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.360
 I really want to be my last 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.699
 face a very beautiful natural shine 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.219
 give this does with a gold color 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.499
 Highlighter this from the H&amp;M and you do 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.330
 with a bedside cupboard a little contamination and 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.719
 then the highlight breaks you exactly 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.649
 on my direction on my newsletter and 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.649
 exactly company 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.010
 this is the complete look i hope 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.600
 you find this very beautiful 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.090
 it is my version of that 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.580
 This year's ladder trend is Muslims 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.380
 with a subtle golden shine and I like it 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.200
 has been with very light pastel shades 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.940
 and then came to this look that 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.800
 you will find this very beautiful later 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.000
 on my own behind energy union fixed 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.920
