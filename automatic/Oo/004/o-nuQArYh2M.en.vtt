00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.990
 I have selected Argentine training 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.090
 good coming to little messi arrived 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.460
 almost on the hour but it went straight 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.370
 pro track and participated some minutes 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.049
 doing some regenerative something like 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.560
 to loosen a little of the legs 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.350
 after long trip in europe up 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.290
 buenos aires the truth is that the great 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.210
 problem that alejandro sabella has is 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.640
 that was Fernandez and Ezequiel Garay 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.250
 the two central holders for the former 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.910
 student technician the current technician 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.180
 of the selection are suspended on 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.470
 side you like the most to know the frame 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 Red 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.460
 I am what the clavicle are activated to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.680
 bulwark it almost certainly does not go to 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.740
 be able to be of the habitual holders 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.810
 only zabaleta and if someone 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.810
 I thought there could be some 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.630
 strange movement or lower it to 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.310
 Mascherano to play central as usual 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.010
 do barcelona either because 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.050
 Mascherano is also suspended 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.930
 then he is putting together the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.210
 puzzles seeing what is more 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.160
 It agrees where you can adapt what is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.140
 the operation and always with the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.740
 head set on what is the redal 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.080
 Paraguay and its history or the air game 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.530
 you will need height to counteract 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.539
 where will it be 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.460
 in recent playoff games 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.610
 the only dangerous weapon that is 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.560
 demonstrating the Paraguayan team inside 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.479
 of this tournament that has him far away 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.189
 of the ranking posts has 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.020
 that win yes or yes and Argentina wins to 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.400
 classify we listened to what they said 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.090
 judges 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.100
 it's a nice week to enjoy it 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840
 you can great effort that has done everything 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.470
 many, especially those that come 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.170
 always not 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.060
 although we all feel part is a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
 very special new science of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 merchant confirmation of trying 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.240
 affirm this good process and give it a 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.580
 support to achieve that goal 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 main thing that was that was to classify 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.870
 What is to classify the world so 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.520
 I wish we would talk about the topic of the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.810
 group good the reality is something that 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 they live permanently all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.430
 players let's say is a constant in the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750
 The rest may be more noticeable in those who do not 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.530
 they have the possibility to play all the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.819
 matches 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.499
 this that punctuates voice 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.209
 and I think the fact that we can 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.840
 Enjoy every moment as I said before 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.549
 talk about that comfort that gives you such 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.240
 time is that it's been longer than 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.100
 one that there are boys that 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 is a group of 16 7 play is that 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.660
 is usually and that integrates very 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.210
 well to the other 4 5 6 sometimes a little 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.920
 more than we are not usual or that out there 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.630
 no no we have not been to all 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.590
 calls for that place 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 sometimes we are not always made 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.400
 very easy to enjoy every moment and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 feel very comfortable 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.820
 we feel part of this project despite 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.280
 that sometimes our always 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.830
 Obviously, one eliminatory 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.010
 qualifying session the keys to see 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.010
 if we can achieve the classification 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.630
 you have to wait until Friday obviously 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.690
 because there may be news but good 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.950
 more than anything else thinking about 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.320
 work well this week that is going to be 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.270
 a little bit different from the usual 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.140
 that we are used to because always 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.240
 was to arrive and work 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.010
 to prepare a match in four days 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.370
 and now perhaps we will be able to do it 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.000
 way a little more intense and good to be able 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.370
 get well to the game of Paraguay with 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.940
 nice possibilities of being able to achieve 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.470
 objective 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.770
 if you did not talk about the fact that I arrive 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.690
 leonel and also marked that by 50% 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.500
 Leonel is different from all the others yes 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.590
 Yes it is 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.570
 it's different even if it's not at 100 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.210
 per hundred but beyond some 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.530
 annoyance you may have suffered in these 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.530
 last months 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.700
 it looks good 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.230
 see him to see how his 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.010
 sensations hopefully we can count on 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.110
 He qualifying for this date 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.870
 because leo is a very important player 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.470
 for us but but good just today 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.470
 it's the first day 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.769
 still missing for enough for the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.690
 Tuesday for the next match so 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.690
 we will have to see how the week goes
