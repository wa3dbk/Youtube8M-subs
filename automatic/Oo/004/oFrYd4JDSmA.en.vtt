monitor as well so looking at multiple
monitors<00:00:41.820> no<00:00:42.000> problem<00:00:42.390> there<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.930> setup<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
monitors no problem there the setup is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.660 
monitors no problem there the setup is
the<00:00:44.070> same<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:45.539> used<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> already

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
mirrored or have the desktop on no

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
mirrored or have the desktop on no
problems<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> new

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
problems there but one of the new

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
problems there but one of the new
features<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.309> showed<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> snapping

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
features they showed was the snapping

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.889 
features they showed was the snapping
capabilities<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.399> how<00:01:00.030> does<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.329> work<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
capabilities so how does that work and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
capabilities so how does that work and
what<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.500> hot<00:01:02.100> keys<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.789> things<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what about hot keys and things like that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
what about hot keys and things like that
do<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.629> work<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.080> well<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.210> if<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.700> or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
do they work as well so if you go to or

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
do they work as well so if you go to or
if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.150> Windows<00:01:09.479> Keys<00:01:09.780> window<00:01:10.260> left

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
if you use your Windows Keys window left

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.870 
if you use your Windows Keys window left
and<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.070> still<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and right you still have that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
and right you still have that
functionality<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.840> before<00:01:13.170> but

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
functionality like you did before but

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.649 
functionality like you did before but
what<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.070> quadrants<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:15.299> they<00:01:15.420> have

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
what about quadrants because they have

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
what about quadrants because they have
the<00:01:15.750> ability<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.170> snap<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> quadrants<00:01:16.860> now

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the ability to snap to quadrants now

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.200 
the ability to snap to quadrants now
well<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.150> press<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:19.070> down<00:01:20.070> left<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:22.040> mini

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
well I can press up down left right mini

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.550 
well I can press up down left right mini
over<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> side<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.930> depends<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.409> if

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
over here on the side it depends on if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
over here on the side it depends on if
you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> Windows<00:01:26.100> Store<00:01:26.310> app<00:01:26.990> like<00:01:27.990> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you have a Windows Store app like this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.160 
you have a Windows Store app like this
one<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.520> people<00:01:29.790> app<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.390> supports

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
one here the the people app it supports

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.090 
one here the the people app it supports
certain<00:01:31.560> types<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.630> snapping<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
certain types of snapping so it has a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.450 
certain types of snapping so it has a
little<00:01:35.310> mini<00:01:36.079> version<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> goes<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
little mini version that it goes to and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
little mini version that it goes to and
then<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> has<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.500> trying<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> scoot<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.890> back

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
then it has a trying to scoot this back

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
then it has a trying to scoot this back
so<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> guys<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.750> has<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so you guys can see then it has more of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
so you guys can see then it has more of
a<00:01:43.290> linear<00:01:44.220> version<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> full-sized

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
a linear version and then a full-sized

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
a linear version and then a full-sized
version<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> right-hand<00:01:47.549> version

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
version and then a right-hand version

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.770 
version and then a right-hand version
but<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> doesn't<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.380> quadrant<00:01:49.950> based

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
but it doesn't have a quadrant based

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
but it doesn't have a quadrant based
version<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:53.009> app<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> Windows

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
version of that app so if it's a Windows

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.929 
version of that app so if it's a Windows
Store<00:01:54.540> app<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.200> may<00:01:55.350> come<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> play<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.640> on

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
Store app that may come to play now on

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
Store app that may come to play now on
something<00:01:57.420> else<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.780> let's<00:01:58.170> say<00:01:58.409> just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
something else like let's say just

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
underneath this quadrant on the second

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.020 
underneath this quadrant on the second
monitor<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.810> click<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:23.250> moves<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.699> from<00:04:23.820> over

monitor I click it moves it from over

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.230 
monitor I click it moves it from over
there

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
there

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050 
there
and<00:04:24.570> puts<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.139> over<00:04:25.320> here<00:04:25.669> so<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:26.789> actually

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and puts it over here so it's actually

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.790 
and puts it over here so it's actually
pretty<00:04:27.210> cool<00:04:27.419> now<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.690> only<00:04:27.990> bad<00:04:28.320> thing<00:04:28.349> that

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
pretty cool now the only bad thing that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.350 
pretty cool now the only bad thing that
I<00:04:28.860> found<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.310> far<00:04:29.550> about<00:04:29.699> this<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.240> it's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I found so far about this is that it's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.830 
I found so far about this is that it's
not<00:04:30.539> smart<00:04:30.930> enough<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.259> know<00:04:32.360> how<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.419> handle

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
not smart enough to know how to handle

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.480 
not smart enough to know how to handle
all<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.259> once<00:04:34.560> you're<00:04:34.740> done<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.340> don't
