mode noter to answer that question we

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160 
mode noter to answer that question we
need<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.410> define<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> mode<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.240> mode<00:00:18.960> is

that are organized into a certain system

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.109 
that are organized into a certain system
it's<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.160> system<00:00:26.670> that's<00:00:26.939> gonna

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it's that system that's gonna

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.450 
it's that system that's gonna
differentiate<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.349> scale<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160 
other if all scales have the same system
there<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.059> scale<00:00:33.540> let's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
there would be just one scale let's

let's<00:00:57.840> start<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> bass<00:00:58.920> note<00:00:59.250> we'll

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
let's start with the bass note we'll

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's start with the bass note we'll
work<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> key<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.570> we're<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.289> simply

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
work in the key of a we're gonna simply

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.850

which<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.820> give<00:01:06.030> us<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.420> bass<00:01:06.689> line<00:01:09.380> now

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
which is gonna give us the bass line now

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
which is gonna give us the bass line now
that<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:10.979> baseline<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:12.390> gonna

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that we have our baseline we're gonna

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.380 
that we have our baseline we're gonna
add<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:12.689> chords<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.560> top<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
add some chords on top of that which are

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.289 
add some chords on top of that which are
gonna<00:01:15.540> give<00:01:16.049> us<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.070> formula<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> mode

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
gonna give us the formula of the mode

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
gonna give us the formula of the mode
that<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.689> working<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.770> idea<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that we're working with the idea here is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
that we're working with the idea here is
to<00:01:20.580> pick<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> appropriate<00:01:21.619> notes<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.549> are

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to pick the appropriate notes that are

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.120 
to pick the appropriate notes that are
gonna<00:01:23.850> give<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.780> characteristic<00:01:25.740> sound

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gonna give you the characteristic sound

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
gonna give you the characteristic sound
of<00:01:26.430> whichever<00:01:27.030> mode<00:01:27.299> were<00:01:27.540> working<00:01:27.960> with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of whichever mode were working with

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.120 
of whichever mode were working with
let's<00:01:28.590> start<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.920> classifying<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:30.000> modes

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
let's start by classifying these modes

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.960 
let's start by classifying these modes
according<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> chord<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:32.850> gonna

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
according to the chord they're gonna

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.700 
according to the chord they're gonna
work<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.900> gonna<00:01:33.990> work<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.200> triads

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
work with we're gonna work with triads

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240 
work with we're gonna work with triads
