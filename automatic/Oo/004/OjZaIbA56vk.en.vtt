00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 Hey, people, I speak of Brazil today. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 bring a video a little different here 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.270
 For you guys, I 'm here the world. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.060
 normal of minecraft I'm going to talk a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.430
 little at 6 and show me something that I 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 I find something very cool that is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 spectacular and it's really cool you should already 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 have noticed that a manicure is a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 little different and yes I have a lot 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 of the shadows installed here I think 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079
 enough part of the gang knows the hate 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.690
 of the shadows if you do not know 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.579
 basically it leaves the minecraft with 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.520
 much nicer graphics you can 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.940
 see here that the environment is shaded 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.309
 and the sun is much cooler and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.160
 other things also an act he 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.559
 move then lets the minecraft a lot 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.260
 more real and much more beautiful happens 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.500
 that a few days ago the people who 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 created this mold has created a new package of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 shadows this package we can 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.890
 installation several different packages 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.350
 in this package here they have put some 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.659
 things I've never seen good 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.299
 some things I can show you 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.310
 You guys are news that does not have everyone. 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 the shadow packets first to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.320
 people have water that is very beautiful and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.470
 as you can see the water reflects 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.869
 exactly the world for example that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 White tree is being reflected 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.030
 by water then this is one of the things 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.619
 very cool here from this pack of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 Shadows, another thing here. 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.640
 the reflection to show well to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.610
 You, for example, here's my good time. 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 of the globe stone and the beak is a reflection 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.270
 very nice and can even the sun 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 was being reflected here on the water and this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 It's very cool, but stay still. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.560
 insisting that there is still something more 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.829
 cool 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 the second thing I found spectacular 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.799
 in this way you should already have 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.920
 perceived not actually in the mod 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.409
 in this package that are the clouds gives a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.259
 Look at these clouds face is kind or that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.680
 this is it cara the clouds of maine craft are 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.310
 let's say a little did are very precarious 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.299
 they are square and a little cattle what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.250
 these guys did in that package were 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.069
 add volumetric clouds these 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.989
 doubts here that look very clouds 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.670
 kind of reality or games with 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.920
 more advanced graphics and I found this 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.269
 here spectacular cloud 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.599
 it was something I had never seen before 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.659
 in minecraft I stuck face you can 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.000
 pass through the middle of the cloud and is kind of 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.030
 cool gives you a much more beautiful look 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.909
 for the game you look at the sky and are 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.040
 clouds is simply this is very 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.139
 Nice, I really liked this effect . 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.150
 cloud to note 10 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.540
 I'll show you the third point. 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.290
 I got this package from here. 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 impressed and had never seen 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.299
 nothing like minecraft before 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.480
 me is the coolest thing in this mold 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.739
 here is the following he simulates is the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.719
 reality 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.099
 based on the climate you are in the greatest 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.689
 For example, I 'm in the weather for now. 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.939
 normal you can see what you 're doing 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.639
 sun and everything is normal 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:20.340
 normal mpf happens that we also 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.650
 has the rainy weather minecraft where 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.220
 Rain starts to rain, so I go. 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.680
 change the climate to the rainy 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.459
 You'll see what's going to happen. 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.870
 in a few seconds rain begins to fall and 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.629
 You can see that we have a 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.389
 effect so much of the time the nude effect 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.769
 haze that leaves everything very 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.159
 interesting you can see that people 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.199
 loses sight of objects that are far away 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.199
 We're very real people. 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.970
 we have a space that is normal and the 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.799
 space around us is a haze 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.930
 Gigantic I found it here. 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.239
 just face that Light Fantastic 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.549
 I thought this out of here is a lot 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.250
 intelligent was a genius water continues 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.709
 falling as you can see here and this 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.530
 effect is very cool, I really liked it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.900
 to be done even if I thought so 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.079
 fantastic and that leaves the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.659
 minecraft with another guy looks at this 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.479
 Old man looks at this hand. 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.519
 I'm going back to normal weather and I 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.169
 I'll show you how it is. 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.190
 Evening time is fine 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.349
 interesting 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.810
 today it's almost dark being you 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.570
 can see that the two also got 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.300
 appearance a little orange as if 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.030
 were the sunset is pretty cool 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.820
 The sun is setting there and you can 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.110
 to see that our world is already 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.380
 another face 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.570
 everything that was clear now is dark and the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.669
 blocks now shine much more 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.860
 available and that the brightness of the 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.530
 You can see from afar including 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.620
 reflex is very strong and I found that 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.020
 It was very cool this night effect. 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.090
 also if I put here a torch 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.790
 for example anything that shines 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.570
 she will reflect with a little color 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.850
 more orange as if it had 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.950
 so a certain heat as if the light 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.560
 transmit a certain heat is very nice 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.460
 Everything around you says everything you do not have 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.520
 this torch or some light nearby is 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.030
 totally dark even the moon that already 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.940
 it's being born there does not light up so much 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.760
 how much the game without this cast of shadows 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.100
 So, man, it's really cool, I think it's 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.770
 a really cool experience if you 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.300
 can and is and even play using 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.240
 this way I think it's possible because 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.010
 they gave a better optimization of the 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.050
 mold and let's say with this 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.660
 shadow pack and if you have a 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.250
 legal advice for you to play here 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.580
 I was able to record a video for 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.950
 You and I do not have to have a super thought. 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.320
 beast to run this way until you 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.500
 can not play with many 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.870
 pictures but I think it 's worth it 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.510
 install to see this new this new 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.100
 The way coaching is, a poll gets 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.280
 I do not even have the words to describe 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.110
 I think it looks really beautiful and it 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.789
 you have the opportunity to test the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.100
 minecraft with a shadow cast and even 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.270
 even with this package here you will have 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.510
 a much cooler experience 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.970
 playing because I know not graphics 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.070
 do not mean so much to a game 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.600
 I do not care much for the graphics myself. 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.240
 nowadays when i got minecraft 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.030
 to play for the first time I found the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.550
 graphic very rotten but gradually they 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.650
 were evolving and today with all this 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.260
 graphic power that we have people 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.750
 can see minecraft as if it were 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.220
 a game of today's generation as if you 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.840
 do not give the field 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.720
 because really with this package of 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.190
 shadows the game is totally different 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.830
 but that's not what I wanted to show 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.320
 For you guys, I think it's all right. 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.690
 interesting minecraft with this mode 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.820
 installed with this death pack of 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.190
 Shadow actually if you want to test 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.160
 I left in the description to make the 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.040
 download and if you liked this template 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.080
 this package a link to help 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.300
 take a look at the creators page 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.470
 they are for pros guys to do it 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.230
 here they must have a job 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.030
 gigantic and that last package they 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.650
 launched a military version of a test 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.560
 I'm sure when they 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.330
 launch the final version will be very 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.470
 better optimized and with the 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.300
 cool news 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.610
 so this is it if you liked the video 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.290
 lets like to sign up for the channel if 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.660
 you have not been signed up and I keep getting 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.660
 here until the next video spoke
