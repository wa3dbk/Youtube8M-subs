00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
put that spin on the basketball on the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.900 
put that spin on the basketball on the
follow-through<00:00:43.710> my<00:00:44.010> hand<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.489> actually<00:00:44.820> going

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
follow-through my hand is actually going

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
follow-through my hand is actually going
to<00:00:45.000> come<00:00:45.149> under<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> basketball<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.620> it's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to come under the basketball but it's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
to come under the basketball but it's
key<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.520> let<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.239> basketball

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
key that you let go of that basketball

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
key that you let go of that basketball
before<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.440> hand<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> underneath<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
before your hand is underneath it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
before your hand is underneath it
because<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.600> hand<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.870> underneath<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
because if your hand is underneath it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
because if your hand is underneath it
while<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.920> still<00:00:52.980> touching<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> basketball

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
while it's still touching the basketball

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240 
while it's still touching the basketball
that's<00:00:54.390> technically<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.079> carry<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.100> want

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that's technically a carry so you want

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
that's technically a carry so you want
to<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.430> sure<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.670> letting<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to make sure you're letting go the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
to make sure you're letting go the
basketball<00:00:57.870> before<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
basketball before you that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
basketball before you that
follow-through<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.550> hand<00:00:59.760> comes<00:01:00.000> under<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
follow-through your hand comes under the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
follow-through your hand comes under the
ball<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.829> situation<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
ball so then in a game situation all you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.340 
ball so then in a game situation all you
would<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> fake<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> pass<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> nice

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
would do is fake that pass get a nice

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
would do is fake that pass get a nice
step<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> jab<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> direction<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
step to jab into that direction to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.280 
step to jab into that direction to
really<00:01:06.210> help<00:01:06.360> sell<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> fake<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.140> come

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
really help sell the fake and then come

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
back to the other direction the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.859
