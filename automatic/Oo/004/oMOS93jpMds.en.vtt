00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
for this map is the fact that you need

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870 
for this map is the fact that you need
Leroy<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.599> open<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.080> certain<00:00:31.320> areas<00:00:32.040> no<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> do

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
Leroy to open up certain areas no I do

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
Leroy to open up certain areas no I do
like<00:00:33.329> innovation<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> when

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
like innovation and I like it when

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
like innovation and I like it when
Treyarch<00:00:35.130> tries<00:00:35.640> new<00:00:35.880> things<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> don't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
Treyarch tries new things but I don't

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
Treyarch tries new things but I don't
like<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.010> end<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.610> taking<00:00:39.270> away

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
like it when they end up taking away

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
like it when they end up taking away
some<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> fundamental<00:00:40.739> parts<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> zombies

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
some of the fundamental parts of zombies

some of the fundamental parts of zombies
yes<00:00:42.450> making<00:00:42.960> barriers<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.980> need

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
yes making barriers that don't need

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
yes making barriers that don't need
points<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> open<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.500> completely<00:00:46.500> innovative

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
points to open is completely innovative

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
points to open is completely innovative
and<00:00:47.340> adds<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.760> new<00:00:47.940> element<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> map<00:00:48.930> but

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and adds a new element to the map but

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
and adds a new element to the map but
that<00:00:49.649> doesn't<00:00:50.010> necessarily<00:00:50.640> make<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.090> good

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that doesn't necessarily make it a good

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
that doesn't necessarily make it a good
idea<00:00:51.649> what<00:00:52.649> ended<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.039> happening<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.000> player

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
idea what ended up happening is a player

will go to the saloon and buy booze to
open<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.780> doors<00:00:58.050> anyways<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> end<00:00:59.160> up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
open up doors anyways so you end up

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
open up doors anyways so you end up
paying<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> doors<00:01:00.359> no<00:01:00.629> matter<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.230> and

paying for the doors no matter what and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
paying for the doors no matter what and
in<00:01:02.430> fact<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.879> usually<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.809> points<00:01:04.080> back

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
in fact you usually get more points back

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
in fact you usually get more points back
than<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> spend<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> booze<00:01:05.580> making<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
than you spend on the booze making the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
than you spend on the booze making the
map<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.470> easier<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.580> something

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
map a bit easier which is not something

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
map a bit easier which is not something
it<00:01:09.210> needed<00:01:09.689> another<00:01:10.070> don't<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.670> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it needed another don't I have for this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.600 
it needed another don't I have for this
map<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.780> witch's<00:01:13.290> house<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> go

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
map is the witch's house now if you go

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
map is the witch's house now if you go
into<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.909> house<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.450> hit<00:01:15.630> by<00:01:15.810> enemies

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.490 
into this house and get hit by enemies
which<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.670> witches<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.780> lose<00:01:19.110> points

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
which are the witches you lose points

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
which are the witches you lose points
and<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> kill<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> witches<00:01:21.450> every

and if you kill all the witches every
five<00:01:22.590> rounds<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> free<00:01:24.450> perk<00:01:24.810> now

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
five rounds you get a free perk now

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
five rounds you get a free perk now
first<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> idea<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> losing<00:01:27.060> points<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
first off the idea of losing points is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
first off the idea of losing points is
something<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.140> every<00:01:28.770> player<00:01:28.979> fears<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
something that every player fears and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.969 
something that every player fears and
makes<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> play<00:01:30.299> even<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:30.750> cautiously<00:01:31.560> when

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
makes you play even more cautiously when

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
makes you play even more cautiously when
entering<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.579> house<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> idea<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> getting

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
entering this house the idea of getting

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560 
entering this house the idea of getting
a<00:01:34.590> free<00:01:34.829> perk<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> nothing<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.060> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a free perk is nothing new and it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.569 
a free perk is nothing new and it's
definitely<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> reward<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> map

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
definitely just a reward to make the map

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.630 
definitely just a reward to make the map
a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.060> easier<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> said<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
a little bit easier now like I said with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.420 
a little bit easier now like I said with
the<00:01:41.970> whole<00:01:42.540> Leroy<00:01:42.990> thing<00:01:43.380> making<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.220> map

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the whole Leroy thing making this map

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
the whole Leroy thing making this map
easier<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.270> something<00:01:45.689> Treyarch<00:01:46.049> had<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
easier is not something Treyarch had to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
easier is not something Treyarch had to
do<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> map<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.310> easy<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.820> begin

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
do because the map was easy to begin

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
do because the map was easy to begin
with<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.840> even<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> difficult<00:01:49.799> map<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
with but even on a difficult map this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
with but even on a difficult map this
wouldn't<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.970> work<00:01:51.360> mainly<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
wouldn't really work mainly because to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
wouldn't really work mainly because to
get<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> free<00:01:53.250> perk<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> stay<00:01:54.240> alive

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
get a free perk you have to stay alive

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
get a free perk you have to stay alive
for<00:01:54.840> five<00:01:55.020> rounds<00:01:55.380> without<00:01:55.590> losing<00:01:55.950> any<00:01:56.070> perks

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
for five rounds without losing any perks

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
for five rounds without losing any perks
and<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> maps<00:01:57.240> difficult<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> it's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and if the maps difficult and it's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
and if the maps difficult and it's
difficult<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.420> not

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
difficult to do that then you're not

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
difficult to do that then you're not
going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.899> able<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.259> use<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:01.680> free<00:02:02.100> perks

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
going to be able to use these free perks

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.469 
going to be able to use these free perks
anyways

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
anyways

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
anyways
however<00:02:04.350> even<00:02:04.860> though<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> fan<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
however even though I'm not a fan of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
however even though I'm not a fan of
this<00:02:06.030> map<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.869> say<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.229> did<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.530> couple

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
this map I can say they did a couple

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.400 
this map I can say they did a couple
things<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.700> first<00:02:09.270> off<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.140> how

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
things right here first off I like how

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.830 
things right here first off I like how
Leroy<00:02:11.280> acts<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> give<00:02:12.239> him<00:02:12.360> candy

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
Leroy acts when you give him candy

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.059 
Leroy acts when you give him candy
whether<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.590> moving

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
whether it be moving

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.670 
whether it be moving
the<00:02:14.159> box<00:02:14.810> building<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> buildable<00:02:16.349> or

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the box building a buildable or

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.780 
the box building a buildable or
protecting<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
protecting you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.539 
protecting you
it's<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.139> cool<00:02:19.590> addition<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.340> game

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
it's a really cool addition to the game

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.910 
it's a really cool addition to the game
mainly<00:02:21.480> because<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.139> he's<00:02:22.290> protecting<00:02:22.889> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
mainly because when he's protecting you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
mainly because when he's protecting you
he<00:02:23.249> acts<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> trap<00:02:24.269> which<00:02:24.540> has<00:02:24.719> always<00:02:24.930> been

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
he acts as a trap which has always been

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
he acts as a trap which has always been
part<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.620> zombies<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.219> it's<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.359> creating<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
part of zombies and it's just creating a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
part of zombies and it's just creating a
new<00:02:28.019> trap<00:02:28.349> which<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.709> always<00:02:28.920> good<00:02:29.280> when

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
new trap which is always good when

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000 
new trap which is always good when
you're<00:02:29.879> moving<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.299> box<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:30.989> adding<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.829> new

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you're moving the box it's adding a new

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.869 
you're moving the box it's adding a new
element<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.489> game

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
element to the game

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.869 
element to the game
which<00:02:33.209> allows<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.930> player<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.230> decide<00:02:35.159> where

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
which allows the player to decide where

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.179 
which allows the player to decide where
he<00:02:36.030> wants<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.200> mystery<00:02:37.560> box<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.040> it's

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
he wants the mystery box to be it's

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.679 
he wants the mystery box to be it's
pretty<00:02:38.400> simple<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.569> really

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
pretty simple and it's just really

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.959 
pretty simple and it's just really
useful<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.739> takes<00:02:41.069> away<00:02:41.370> from<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.879> the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
useful and it takes away from one of the

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.149 
useful and it takes away from one of the
most<00:02:42.180> annoying<00:02:42.750> parts<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.379> zombies<00:02:43.769> which<00:02:43.980> is

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
most annoying parts of zombies which is

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.699 
most annoying parts of zombies which is
chasing<00:02:44.700> down<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.209> mystery<00:02:45.629> box<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.109> once

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
chasing down the mystery box and once

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.589 
chasing down the mystery box and once
again<00:02:46.919> when<00:02:47.340> he<00:02:47.430> builds<00:02:47.790> buildable<00:02:48.209> --zz<00:02:48.359> for

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
again when he builds buildable --zz for

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.780 
again when he builds buildable --zz for
the<00:02:48.689> player<00:02:48.930> he's<00:02:49.439> again<00:02:49.829> eliminating<00:02:50.639> an

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the player he's again eliminating an

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.909 
the player he's again eliminating an
annoying<00:02:51.599> part<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.169> map<00:02:52.409> which<00:02:52.889> is

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
annoying part of the map which is

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.819 
annoying part of the map which is
definitely<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.120> good<00:02:54.269> thing<00:02:54.829> something

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
definitely a really good thing something

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.439 
definitely a really good thing something
else<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.099> really<00:02:56.400> liked<00:02:56.609> about<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.030> map<00:02:57.209> is

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
else I really liked about this map is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.539 
else I really liked about this map is
the<00:02:57.750> chalk<00:02:58.079> drawings<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.919> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.159> place<00:02:59.400> on

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
the chalk drawings that you can place on

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.270 
the chalk drawings that you can place on
the<00:02:59.699> walls<00:02:59.939> now<00:03:00.810> what<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.169> is<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.980> get

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the walls now what this is is you get

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.539 
the walls now what this is is you get
the<00:03:02.430> choice<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:03.329> place<00:03:03.840> five<00:03:04.439> weapons<00:03:04.949> on<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
the choice to place five weapons on the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.250 
the choice to place five weapons on the
wall<00:03:05.760> wherever<00:03:06.239> you'd<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.569> wherever

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
wall wherever you'd like wherever

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.379 
wall wherever you'd like wherever
there's<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.620> question<00:03:08.010> mark<00:03:08.219> so<00:03:08.459> basically<00:03:08.909> you

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
there's a question mark so basically you

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.409 
there's a question mark so basically you
have<00:03:09.510> five<00:03:09.780> options<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.949> put<00:03:11.189> each<00:03:11.489> gun<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
have five options to put each gun and

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.959 
have five options to put each gun and
you<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.199> pick<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.709> choose<00:03:13.769> now<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.819> is

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
you get to pick and choose now this is

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.909 
you get to pick and choose now this is
almost<00:03:15.239> allowing<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.139> player<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.620> customize

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
almost allowing the player to customize

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.629 
almost allowing the player to customize
the<00:03:17.549> map<00:03:17.819> itself<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.799> doing<00:03:20.159> this<00:03:20.340> they're

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
the map itself and in doing this they're

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.879 
the map itself and in doing this they're
giving<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:20.970> player<00:03:21.180> more<00:03:21.509> strategies<00:03:22.439> more

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
giving the player more strategies more

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.369 
giving the player more strategies more
ways<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.189> play<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.790> map<00:03:23.970> how<00:03:24.599> they<00:03:24.930> want<00:03:25.229> to

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
ways to play the map how they want to

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.530 
ways to play the map how they want to
play<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.889> that's<00:03:26.400> fantastic<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.299> think

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
play it and that's fantastic I think

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.909 
play it and that's fantastic I think
that<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> would<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.109> great<00:03:28.379> addition<00:03:28.889> to

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
that that would be a great addition to

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.969 
that that would be a great addition to
any<00:03:29.159> map<00:03:29.579> really<00:03:30.229> now<00:03:31.229> to<00:03:31.290> end<00:03:31.560> off<00:03:31.769> these

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
any map really now to end off these

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.649 
any map really now to end off these
videos<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.549> always<00:03:32.819> say<00:03:32.939> something<00:03:33.299> that's<00:03:33.509> a

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
videos I always say something that's a

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.349 
videos I always say something that's a
little<00:03:33.870> bit<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.259> the<00:03:34.409> middle<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:35.280> me<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.699> that

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
little bit in the middle for me and that

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.449 
little bit in the middle for me and that
thing<00:03:36.689> in<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.169> case<00:03:37.409> is<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.009> Wonder<00:03:38.370> weapon

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
thing in this case is the Wonder weapon

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.189 
thing in this case is the Wonder weapon
on<00:03:38.729> this<00:03:38.849> map<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.269> paralyzer

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
on this map the paralyzer

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.080 
on this map the paralyzer
now<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> paralyzer<00:03:41.250> allows<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.939> do

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
now what the paralyzer allows you to do

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.509 
now what the paralyzer allows you to do
is<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.750> slows<00:03:43.229> a<00:03:43.259> group<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.919> zombies<00:03:43.949> at<00:03:44.489> once

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
is it slows a group of zombies at once

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.300 
is it slows a group of zombies at once
slowly<00:03:45.329> killing<00:03:45.780> them<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.229> it<00:03:46.709> doesn't<00:03:47.129> use

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
slowly killing them and it doesn't use

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.420 
slowly killing them and it doesn't use
ammo<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.970> actually<00:03:48.500> cools<00:03:49.500> down<00:03:49.680> instead<00:03:50.400> a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
ammo it actually cools down instead a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.729 
ammo it actually cools down instead a
lot<00:03:50.579> like<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.000> jet<00:03:51.269> gun<00:03:51.479> except<00:03:52.259> unlike<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
lot like the jet gun except unlike the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 
lot like the jet gun except unlike the
jet<00:03:52.919> gun<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.220> doesn't<00:03:53.519> explode<00:03:53.909> into<00:03:54.299> pieces

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
jet gun it doesn't explode into pieces

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.110 
jet gun it doesn't explode into pieces
when<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> hits<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.949> maximum<00:03:56.400> point<00:03:56.639> it<00:03:56.849> just

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
when it hits the maximum point it just

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.349 
when it hits the maximum point it just
changes<00:03:57.599> into<00:03:58.019> an<00:03:58.169> unusable<00:03:58.829> state<00:03:59.280> oh<00:03:59.609> and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
changes into an unusable state oh and

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.110 
changes into an unusable state oh and
also<00:04:00.780> we<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.229> let<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.500> fly<00:04:01.829> yep<00:04:02.519> that's<00:04:02.819> right

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
also we can let you fly yep that's right

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.780 
also we can let you fly yep that's right
this<00:04:03.540> gun<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> bit<00:04:04.469> overpowered<00:04:05.219> and<00:04:05.430> allows

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
this gun is a bit overpowered and allows

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.390 
this gun is a bit overpowered and allows
the<00:04:06.030> player<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.469> exploit<00:04:07.469> the<00:04:07.680> map<00:04:07.859> in<00:04:08.040> certain

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the player to exploit the map in certain

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.459 
the player to exploit the map in certain
ways<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.939> being<00:04:09.479> said<00:04:09.719> I<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:10.259> the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
ways that being said I like the

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.469 
ways that being said I like the
innovation<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.159> like<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.669> brand<00:04:11.969> new<00:04:12.180> Wonder

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
to use it's just a beta Blee a little

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.659 
to use it's just a beta Blee a little
overpowered<00:04:18.299> for<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.780> map<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.400> just

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
overpowered for this map so that's just
