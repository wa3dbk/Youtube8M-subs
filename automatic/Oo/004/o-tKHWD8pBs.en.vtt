 One more video and people this time I'm 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460

 shaders in version 10.1 12.11 I came to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.850
 Who does not know the texture that goes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.680
 add motion shadows and everything else 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 to leave our minecraft more 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 realistic will trigger a lighting 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.460
 better and will leave the minecraft p well 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.350
 most of the time you will be installing 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 This texture needs to have a blog away 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.300
 in the latest version for zero point 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 12.1 to factory 11 if you have not 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 will be here in the video description 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.359
 along with a download link from that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 texture and look, the guys have a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 very realistic shadow here and also the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.590
 leaves of the trees are moving 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.140
 Look at the guys like that smell of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 pc neoci tree pruning also this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 movement then just looks the crowd was 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 well even then some plants there 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 can move around but only those 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.470
 plants larger than 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 Look at the plantations that move the water. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.310
 there also seems to be a wind here 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.189
 so the waters now they are 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.170
 having waves here is leaving much more 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 realistic our mcp 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.420
 Look, there's water in here too. 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 some boats here will get the lava and here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.869
 we can see that the lighting has changed 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 enough in the blocks we can 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.430
 to perceive here that in the luminous stone she 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 lighting is much better here is a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.180
 much bigger place here 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.970
 This left well but at the time it also has to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.100
 lighting in furniture that has been modified 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 so now the furniture will also have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 shadows and lighting let it show 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.289
