this is normal this is why most of the

and pull them monitor the bulb out so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.280

now this is gone in the past we would

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.950 
now this is gone in the past we would
have<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.590> go<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.310> install<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.970> new<00:03:30.150> bulb<00:03:30.390> get

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
have to go and install a new bulb get

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.180 
have to go and install a new bulb get
our<00:03:31.050> soldering<00:03:31.410> iron<00:03:31.770> out<00:03:32.180> heat<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> up<00:03:33.420> and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
our soldering iron out heat it up and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.700 
our soldering iron out heat it up and
solder<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> new<00:03:35.610> bolt<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:37.350> great<00:03:37.560> thing

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
solder on a new bolt the great thing

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.100 
solder on a new bolt the great thing
about<00:03:37.800> this<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.970> trash<00:03:39.750> now<00:03:39.930> we

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
about this is that this is trash now we

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.600 
about this is that this is trash now we
don't<00:03:40.200> have<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.470> use<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.650> anymore<00:03:41.070> because

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
don't have to use that anymore because

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.270 
don't have to use that anymore because
we<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> LED<00:03:42.210> replacement<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.590> can<00:03:44.190> be

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
we have the LED replacement this can be

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.100 
we have the LED replacement this can be
done<00:03:44.460> out<00:03:44.490> in<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> field<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.660> doesn't<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:46.020> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
done out in the field it doesn't have to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.410 
done out in the field it doesn't have to
be<00:03:46.200> brought<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.650> repair<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:48.060> now<00:03:48.150> we<00:03:48.210> take

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
be brought in for repair so now we take

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.610 
be brought in for repair so now we take
