on clean supply of water as we know
water<00:00:29.120> covers<00:00:29.810> more<00:00:30.230> than<00:00:30.490> 70%<00:00:31.490> of<00:00:31.640> the

Earth's surface the heat energy from the
Sun<00:00:38.289> causes<00:00:39.289> some<00:00:39.589> of<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.920> water<00:00:40.190> to

Sun causes some of the water to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.779

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.860 
evaporate from the surface of oceans
lakes<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.960> rivers<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.359> from<00:00:47.359> plants<00:00:47.899> as<00:00:48.050> well

when<00:00:50.870> water<00:00:51.199> evaporates<00:00:51.819> it<00:00:52.819> changes<00:00:53.420> from

when water evaporates it changes from

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.119 
when water evaporates it changes from
liquid<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.499> gas<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:56.390> water<00:00:56.839> vapor<00:00:56.949> rises<00:00:57.949> and

liquid to gas this water vapor rises and

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.439 
liquid to gas this water vapor rises and
cools<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:59.120> then<00:01:00.079> condenses<00:01:00.920> back<00:01:01.179> into<00:01:02.179> water

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
cools and then condenses back into water

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.200 
cools and then condenses back into water
to<00:01:02.749> form<00:01:03.289> clouds<00:01:05.920> when<00:01:06.920> water<00:01:07.280> molecules<00:01:07.550> in

to form clouds when water molecules in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.200 
to form clouds when water molecules in
clouds<00:01:08.830> collect<00:01:09.830> into<00:01:10.190> big<00:01:10.490> enough<00:01:10.760> drops

clouds collect into big enough drops
they<00:01:12.170> fall<00:01:12.560> as<00:01:12.830> rain<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:13.580> snow<00:01:14.180> depending<00:01:15.140> on

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
they fall as rain or snow depending on

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.249 
they fall as rain or snow depending on
the<00:01:15.410> temperature

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
the temperature

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.209 
the temperature
this<00:01:18.259> runs<00:01:18.700> into<00:01:19.700> rivers<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.359> lakes<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.259> can

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
this runs into rivers and lakes and can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.149 
this runs into rivers and lakes and can
sometimes<00:01:22.759> soak<00:01:23.179> into<00:01:23.899> underground<00:01:24.799> layers

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
sometimes soak into underground layers

sometimes soak into underground layers
of<00:01:25.460> rock<00:01:28.090> eventually<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.869> water<00:01:30.079> returns<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
of rock eventually the water returns to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.330 
of rock eventually the water returns to
the<00:01:31.399> oceans<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.539> complete<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.259> cycle

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.340 

let's<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> water<00:01:39.150> cycle<00:01:41.210> first<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:43.110> see

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
let's see the water cycle first we see

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.480 
let's see the water cycle first we see
the<00:01:43.560> rain<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.700> left<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.300> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.560> we

the rain on the left and on the right we

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270 
the rain on the left and on the right we
see<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.090> formation<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.870> clouds<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:50.250> the

see the formation of clouds by the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:01.250 
see the formation of clouds by the
process<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.260> evaporation<00:01:59.090> this<00:02:00.090> process<00:02:00.720> of
