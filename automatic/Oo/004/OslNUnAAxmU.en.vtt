to UC Davis I know that it's a very
competitive<00:04:42.410> school<00:04:42.980> but<00:04:43.220> that's<00:04:43.640> what<00:04:43.790> I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
competitive school but that's what I

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
know what what you're gonna do when you

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.580 
know what what you're gonna do when you
grow<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:54.890> who<00:04:55.160> knows<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:56.270> know<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.780> think<00:04:57.290> it's

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
grow up who knows you know I think it's

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.050 
grow up who knows you know I think it's
better<00:04:57.950> for<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> kids<00:04:58.550> because<00:04:58.760> they<00:04:58.910> have

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
better for the kids because they have

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.600 
better for the kids because they have
more<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.360> track<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.810> follow<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.530> she<00:05:01.400> knows

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
more of a track to follow and she knows

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.880 
more of a track to follow and she knows
now<00:05:01.880> do<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.210> have<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.600> keep<00:05:03.230> your<00:05:03.440> grades<00:05:03.650> up

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
now do you have to keep your grades up

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.280 
now do you have to keep your grades up
from<00:05:04.310> ninth<00:05:04.880> grade<00:05:05.000> on<00:05:05.180> even<00:05:05.840> before<00:05:05.990> that

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.270 
also what's important is like how fast
and<00:05:53.120> efficient<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.540> can<00:05:53.690> do<00:05:53.810> stuff<00:05:54.050> so<00:05:54.920> like<00:05:55.190> I

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
and efficient I can do stuff so like I

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.370 
and efficient I can do stuff so like I
think<00:05:55.490> about<00:05:55.670> that<00:05:55.850> more<00:05:56.090> I'm<00:05:56.450> like<00:05:56.660> doing

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
think about that more I'm like doing

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.960 
think about that more I'm like doing
homework<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:58.070> what's<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.370> most<00:05:58.520> efficient

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
homework like what's the most efficient

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.320 
homework like what's the most efficient
way<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.390> can<00:05:59.780> get<00:05:59.840> this<00:05:59.990> done<00:06:00.760> mentors<00:06:01.760> like<00:06:01.850> Dan

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
way I can get this done mentors like Dan

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.510 
way I can get this done mentors like Dan
and<00:06:02.600> Karen<00:06:02.990> Galland<00:06:03.440> believe<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.040> value<00:06:04.370> of

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
and Karen Galland believe the value of

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.880 
and Karen Galland believe the value of
met<00:06:04.760> internships<00:06:05.480> goes<00:06:05.810> well<00:06:06.110> beyond<00:06:06.620> the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
met internships goes well beyond the

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.520 
met internships goes well beyond the
work<00:06:07.070> that's<00:06:07.310> done<00:06:07.990> there<00:06:08.990> are<00:06:09.170> so<00:06:09.470> many

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
work that's done there are so many

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.040 
work that's done there are so many
people<00:06:09.920> that<00:06:10.100> are<00:06:10.370> drift<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.720> schools

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
people that are drift and the schools

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.540 
people that are drift and the schools
don't<00:06:12.260> have<00:06:12.410> any<00:06:12.620> money<00:06:12.860> for<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.250> lot<00:06:13.430> of

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
don't have any money for a lot of

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.890 
don't have any money for a lot of
programs<00:06:13.970> they<00:06:14.150> certainly<00:06:14.420> don't<00:06:14.570> have<00:06:14.750> any

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
programs they certainly don't have any

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.230 
programs they certainly don't have any
money<00:06:15.050> for<00:06:15.340> vocational<00:06:16.340> programs<00:06:16.850> as<00:06:17.120> you

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
money for vocational programs as you

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.900 
money for vocational programs as you
probably<00:06:17.510> heard<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:18.290> I<00:06:18.440> think<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:19.550> gives

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
probably heard and I think this gives

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.020 
probably heard and I think this gives
them<00:06:20.630> a<00:06:20.750> chance<00:06:20.780> to<00:06:21.320> learn<00:06:21.970> different<00:06:22.970> skills

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
them a chance to learn different skills

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.420 
them a chance to learn different skills
and<00:06:23.660> also<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.170> learn<00:06:24.470> what<00:06:24.800> they<00:06:24.920> might<00:06:25.130> really

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
and also to learn what they might really

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.190 
and also to learn what they might really
want<00:06:25.640> to

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
want to

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.420

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
as a career I'm still learning so that's

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.150 
as a career I'm still learning so that's
one<00:06:31.210> of<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.390> good<00:06:31.570> things<00:06:31.630> being<00:06:32.590> at<00:06:32.740> Midwest
