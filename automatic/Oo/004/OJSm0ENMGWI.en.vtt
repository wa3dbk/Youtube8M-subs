basically<00:00:20.460> today<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
basically today we're just going to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
basically today we're just going to
start<00:00:21.660> off<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.080> laser<00:00:22.439> gun<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.070> kind<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'm it shoots a issues a beam of laser

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.459 
I'm it shoots a issues a beam of laser
and<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.100> uh<00:00:56.360> it's<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.199> I

and it's like uh it's it's like I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.250 
and it's like uh it's it's like I
wouldn't<00:00:58.980> say<00:00:59.100> fully<00:00:59.579> automatic<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.930> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
wouldn't say fully automatic but it you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
wouldn't say fully automatic but it you
hold<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> r1<00:01:02.100> button<00:01:02.340> oh<00:01:02.460> shoot<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
hold down the r1 button oh shoot this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
hold down the r1 button oh shoot this
constant<00:01:03.390> beam<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> laser<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
constant beam of laser and in the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.340 
constant beam of laser and in the
description<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.519> says<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.810> longer<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
description it says that the longer you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
description it says that the longer you
hold<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.250> beam<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.689> damage<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
hold the beam the more damage and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
hold the beam the more damage and
outputs<00:01:10.680> uh<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.750> found<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:14.000> what<00:01:15.000> also

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
outputs uh but I found that what also

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.080 
outputs uh but I found that what also
needs<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> happen<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
needs to happen is you need to have a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
needs to happen is you need to have a
direct<00:01:18.360> correlation<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:20.040> amount<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
direct correlation with the amount of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
direct correlation with the amount of
damage<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.810> distance<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.500> away

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
damage and the distance you are away

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
damage and the distance you are away
from<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> person<00:01:23.159> has<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> correlation<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
from the person has a correlation to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.410 
from the person has a correlation to
each<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:24.960> means<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.520> say<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.090> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
each other which means that say you are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
each other which means that say you are
further<00:01:27.810> away<00:01:27.990> from<00:01:28.140> someone<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> you're

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
further away from someone and you're

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
further away from someone and you're
shooting<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> long<00:01:30.090> time<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.659> damage<00:01:31.200> will

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
shooting for a long time the damage will

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
shooting for a long time the damage will
be<00:01:31.640> incredibly<00:01:32.640> hot<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.390> close

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
be incredibly hot if you're really close

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
be incredibly hot if you're really close
to<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.930> person<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:35.250> still<00:01:35.549> shooting

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to that person and you're still shooting

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
to that person and you're still shooting
for<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> long<00:01:36.180> time<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> damage<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
for a long time the damage will be very

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
for a long time the damage will be very
minuscule<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.430> won't<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
minuscule and it won't really have that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
minuscule and it won't really have that
big<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:39.750> effect<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.229> person<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.790> I'll

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
big of an effect on a person and I'll

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.219 
big of an effect on a person and I'll
kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> demonstrate<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> couple<00:01:43.079> times

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
kind of demonstrate that a couple times

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
kind of demonstrate that a couple times
i'll<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> long-range<00:01:44.729> ones<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
i'll do the long-range ones in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.819 
i'll do the long-range ones in the
beginning<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> video<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.290> you'll<00:01:46.770> see

seeing and then there'll be a couple
guys<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.360> comp<00:01:51.780> behind<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.200> I'll<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.439> them

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it'll be a fairly large distance and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.670 
it'll be a fairly large distance and
then<00:01:54.390> during<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> end<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.200> clip<00:01:55.470> I'll

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
then during the end of this clip I'll

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980 
then during the end of this clip I'll
have<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.090> close<00:01:57.420> range<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
have like you know close range so as you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.389 
have like you know close range so as you
see<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.380> pretty<00:01:58.799> far<00:01:59.009> away<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.219> him

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
see here I'm pretty far away from him

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
see here I'm pretty far away from him
and<00:01:59.549> shield<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.810> quick<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> his

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and shield go down really quick and his

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
and shield go down really quick and his
health<00:02:01.710> goes<00:02:01.890> down<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.310> quick<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.880> got

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
health goes down really quick and I got

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
health goes down really quick and I got
that<00:02:03.210> kill<00:02:03.450> fairly<00:02:03.990> easy<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.469> barely<00:02:05.430> lost<00:02:05.820> any

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that kill fairly easy I barely lost any

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969 
that kill fairly easy I barely lost any
ammunition<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.740> hundred

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
ammunition as you see I have a hundred

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
ammunition as you see I have a hundred
rounds<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.849> comes<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.360> 400ex

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
rounds and I think it comes with a 400ex

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.650 
rounds and I think it comes with a 400ex
day<00:02:10.289> ammunition<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.220> from<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.849> far<00:02:12.090> from<00:02:12.420> far

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
day ammunition so from this far from far

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
day ammunition so from this far from far
away<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.020> was<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
away that was a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.270 
away that was a
very<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.400> fast<00:02:14.640> kill<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:17.250> see

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
very very fast kill and here as you see

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 
very very fast kill and here as you see
I'm<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.579> little<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.209> closer<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.720> guide<00:02:18.870> about

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I'm a little bit closer the guide about

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380 
I'm a little bit closer the guide about
that<00:02:19.409> much<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.280> able<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.909> take<00:02:21.090> down<00:02:21.269> his

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that much and I'm able to take down his

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.319 
that much and I'm able to take down his
health<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.959> shield<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:23.159> not<00:02:23.939> that

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
health and a shield but not that

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.509 
health and a shield but not that
effective<00:02:24.840> size<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.409> see<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.159> really

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
effective size you see like it really

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.970 
effective size you see like it really
does<00:02:27.239> matter<00:02:27.629> how<00:02:28.019> far<00:02:28.319> away<00:02:28.439> you<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.799> from

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
does matter how far away you are from

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.619 
does matter how far away you are from
the<00:02:29.250> guy<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.610> shot<00:02:29.819> him<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.209> pretty<00:02:30.420> long

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
the guy and I shot him for a pretty long

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.330 
the guy and I shot him for a pretty long
time<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.109> shield<00:02:31.349> did<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.799> go<00:02:31.950> down<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
time and the shield did not go down so I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.440 
time and the shield did not go down so I
just<00:02:32.459> kind<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> switched<00:02:32.879> out<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> pistol

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
just kind of switched out to the pistol

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.550 
just kind of switched out to the pistol
hopefully<00:02:33.689> we<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.900> get<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.049> guy<00:02:34.349> without

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
hopefully we can get this guy without

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.849 
hopefully we can get this guy without
him<00:02:34.769> killing<00:02:34.980> us<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:36.409> man<00:02:37.409> this<00:02:37.560> guy's<00:02:37.739> just

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
him killing us and man this guy's just

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.140 
him killing us and man this guy's just
run<00:02:38.069> away<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.489> sniper<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.849> think<00:02:39.060> he's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
run away with a sniper I think he's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.089 
run away with a sniper I think he's
trying<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.569> no<00:02:40.260> scope<00:02:40.590> bus<00:02:40.769> or<00:02:40.920> quick

back<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.540> laser<00:03:00.870> gone<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:02.040> buy<00:03:02.189> this<00:03:02.250> gun

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
back to the laser gone you buy this gun

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.149 
back to the laser gone you buy this gun
from<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.849> market<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.389> it<00:03:04.049> doesn't<00:03:04.829> cost<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
from the market and it doesn't cost a

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.039 
from the market and it doesn't cost a
lot<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.609> kit<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.970> believe<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.659> fairly

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
lot of is kit I believe it's fairly

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.220 
lot of is kit I believe it's fairly
cheap<00:03:07.439> to<00:03:07.760> buy<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.819> weapon<00:03:09.299> I<00:03:09.540> would

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
cheap to buy this weapon I would

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.839 
cheap to buy this weapon I would
recommend<00:03:10.319> buying<00:03:10.799> at<00:03:10.980> least<00:03:11.189> like<00:03:11.400> 30<00:03:11.760> of

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
recommend buying at least like 30 of

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.390 
recommend buying at least like 30 of
them<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.889> go<00:03:14.099> through<00:03:14.280> these

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
them because you can go through these

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.339 
them because you can go through these
very<00:03:14.730> fairly<00:03:15.150> quickly<00:03:15.510> depending<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.170> what

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
very fairly quickly depending on what

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.420 
very fairly quickly depending on what
kind<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> map<00:03:16.829> you're<00:03:17.010> playing<00:03:17.189> if<00:03:17.340> you're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
kind of map you're playing if you're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.580 
kind of map you're playing if you're
playing<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> close-quarters<00:03:18.419> map<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
playing on a close-quarters map do not I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.949 
playing on a close-quarters map do not I
let<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.280> do<00:03:20.549> not<00:03:20.730> even<00:03:21.030> pick<00:03:21.419> a<00:03:21.449> laser<00:03:21.840> gun

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
let you do not even pick a laser gun

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.189 
let you do not even pick a laser gun
because<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:23.250> won't<00:03:23.639> be<00:03:24.030> very<00:03:24.060> effective<00:03:24.690> like

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
because it won't be very effective like

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.530 
because it won't be very effective like
I<00:03:25.319> said<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.699> a<00:03:26.940> good<00:03:27.180> amount<00:03:27.389> of

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
I said you have to have a good amount of

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.270 
I said you have to have a good amount of
distance<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.500> actually<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:29.040> some

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
distance for it to actually do some

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.659 
distance for it to actually do some
damage<00:03:29.549> um<00:03:31.129> but<00:03:32.129> if<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.340> playing<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.639> a

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
damage um but if you're playing on a

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.119 
damage um but if you're playing on a
long<00:03:32.879> long<00:03:33.239> range<00:03:33.480> map<00:03:33.659> like<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
long long range map like this then the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.369 
long long range map like this then the
laser<00:03:35.340> gun<00:03:35.609> is<00:03:35.819> really<00:03:36.389> really<00:03:36.659> effective<00:03:37.199> as

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
laser gun is really really effective as

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.020 
laser gun is really really effective as
you<00:03:37.590> hear<00:03:37.769> she<00:03:37.980> I'm<00:03:38.129> really<00:03:38.519> close<00:03:38.699> to<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.879> guy

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you hear she I'm really close to the guy

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030 
you hear she I'm really close to the guy
I<00:03:39.060> didn't<00:03:39.780> even<00:03:39.870> take<00:03:40.169> down<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.409> shield<00:03:40.769> all<00:03:40.919> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I didn't even take down a shield all the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.849 
I didn't even take down a shield all the
way<00:03:41.870> before<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.900> actually<00:03:43.290> switch<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.769> my

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
way before I actually switch to my

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.949 
way before I actually switch to my
pistol<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.609> was<00:03:45.000> not<00:03:45.359> going<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.780> be

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
pistol because I was not going to be

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.960 
pistol because I was not going to be
able<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.229> kill<00:03:46.349> him<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.609> laser

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
able to kill him with just that laser

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.849 
able to kill him with just that laser
guns<00:03:48.180> up<00:03:48.449> close<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.229> that<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.409> mean<00:03:49.650> there's

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
guns up close so that I mean there's

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.759 
guns up close so that I mean there's
just<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.159> couple<00:03:50.190> examples<00:03:50.579> on<00:03:51.120> how<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:52.319> no

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
just a couple examples on how the no

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.409 
just a couple examples on how the no
matter<00:03:52.949> even<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.459> you're<00:03:53.639> holding<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> array

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
matter even if you're holding the array

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.409 
matter even if you're holding the array
for<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> long<00:03:54.959> time<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:56.459> need<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.669> have<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:57.120> good

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
for a long time you need to have a good

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.119 
for a long time you need to have a good
distance<00:03:57.659> from<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.229> actually<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.650> some<00:03:58.919> good

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
distance from to actually do some good

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.610 
distance from to actually do some good
damage<00:03:59.780> another<00:04:00.780> thing<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.019> guys<00:04:01.229> should<00:04:01.409> be

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
damage another thing you guys should be

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.589 
damage another thing you guys should be
careful<00:04:02.459> about<00:04:02.519> what<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.909> weapon<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.389> that

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
careful about what this weapon is that

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.740 
careful about what this weapon is that
it<00:04:03.810> actually<00:04:03.989> has<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.750> overheat

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
it actually has a like a overheat

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.349 
it actually has a like a overheat
feature<00:04:07.079> where<00:04:07.949> if<00:04:07.979> you<00:04:08.340> hold<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.970> Ray<00:04:09.120> for

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
too long the gun will overheat and i'll

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.860 
too long the gun will overheat and i'll
actually<00:04:11.069> deal<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.699> lot<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.209> damage<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.569> I've

a<00:04:15.299> gun<00:04:15.510> fight<00:04:15.780> where<00:04:15.810> I've<00:04:15.989> been<00:04:16.680> too<00:04:16.919> close<00:04:17.130> to

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
a gun fight where I've been too close to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.349 
a gun fight where I've been too close to
the<00:04:17.370> guy<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.549> I'm<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:17.940> doing<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> lot<00:04:18.299> of

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the guy and I'm not doing a lot of

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.930 
the guy and I'm not doing a lot of
damage<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.349> forget<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.949> stop<00:04:20.579> shooting<00:04:20.849> the

gun and overheats and it just kills me
and<00:04:23.159> it<00:04:23.279> says<00:04:23.490> I've<00:04:23.669> gotten<00:04:24.029> a<00:04:24.120> suicide<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:25.340> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
and it says I've gotten a suicide so you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
and it says I've gotten a suicide so you
know<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.520> got<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.000> got<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.240> be

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
know you got it you got to be

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.649 
know you got it you got to be
careful<00:04:27.750> about<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.199> with<00:04:28.349> this<00:04:28.379> gun<00:04:28.740> it's

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
careful about that with this gun it's

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.619 
careful about that with this gun it's
but<00:04:30.659> overall<00:04:31.409> it's<00:04:32.069> a<00:04:32.250> really<00:04:32.310> good<00:04:32.789> gone<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
but overall it's a really good gone the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.020 
but overall it's a really good gone the
reload<00:04:33.930> speed<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.469> fairly<00:04:35.250> quick<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.819> mean

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
reload speed is fairly quick I mean

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.790 
reload speed is fairly quick I mean
compared<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.659> like<00:04:36.840> assault<00:04:37.259> rifles<00:04:37.620> and

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
compared to like assault rifles and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.490 
compared to like assault rifles and
stuff<00:04:38.009> it's<00:04:38.280> fairly<00:04:39.090> quick<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:39.719> some<00:04:39.840> very

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
stuff it's fairly quick and some very

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.070 
stuff it's fairly quick and some very
good<00:04:40.800> like<00:04:41.159> high<00:04:41.490> output<00:04:41.879> damage<00:04:42.539> gone<00:04:42.780> on

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
good like high output damage gone on

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.219 
good like high output damage gone on
it's<00:04:43.530> got<00:04:43.680> some<00:04:43.949> really<00:04:44.129> good<00:04:44.340> range<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:45.479> if

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
it's got some really good range so if

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.200
