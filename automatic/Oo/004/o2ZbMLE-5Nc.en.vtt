this<00:00:05.730> demo<00:00:06.000> shows<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.540> step<00:00:06.810> line<00:00:07.049> series

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
this demo shows the step line series

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.379 
this demo shows the step line series
view<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.189> view<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.519> useful<00:00:09.059> when<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.360> need
