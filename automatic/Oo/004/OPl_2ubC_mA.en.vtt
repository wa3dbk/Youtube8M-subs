what<00:00:11.250> semi-decent

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.020 

now<00:00:21.790> when<00:00:22.000> you<00:00:22.120> pour<00:00:23.790> sodium<00:00:24.790> through

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
now when you pour sodium through

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.240 
now when you pour sodium through
hydraulic<00:00:25.690> fluid<00:00:25.990> if<00:00:26.140> it's<00:00:26.290> not<00:00:26.560> quite<00:00:26.860> hot

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
hydraulic fluid if it's not quite hot

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.430 
hydraulic fluid if it's not quite hot
enough<00:00:27.580> you<00:00:28.330> get<00:00:28.510> a<00:00:28.540> lot<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.780> beads<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.760> appears

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
enough you get a lot of beads it appears

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:42.000 
enough you get a lot of beads it appears
we<00:00:32.440> made<00:00:32.650> it<00:00:32.800> may<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.370> done<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:41.920> see

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
we made it may have done that so you see

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
we made it may have done that so you see
it<00:00:42.309> can't<00:00:42.610> breaking<00:00:43.120> apart<00:00:43.239> they're

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.100 

certainly<00:00:49.030> not<00:00:49.150> what<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:49.600> want

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
certainly not what we want

00:00:50.110 --> 00:01:04.350 
certainly not what we want
oh<00:00:53.519> boy<00:00:54.519> that's<00:00:54.760> disappointing<00:01:02.159> just<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
oh boy that's disappointing just the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120 
oh boy that's disappointing just the
whole<00:01:04.540> thing<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:05.050> crumbles<00:01:05.530> into<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> bunch

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
whole thing just crumbles into a bunch

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.950 
whole thing just crumbles into a bunch
of<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:10.360> tiny<00:01:10.540> babies<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:13.450> right<00:01:13.659> well

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
of little tiny babies all right well

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.680 
of little tiny babies all right well
we're<00:01:14.140> gonna<00:01:14.229> have<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.530> try<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.770> one<00:01:14.950> again

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
we're gonna have to try that one again

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.040 
we're gonna have to try that one again
that<00:01:16.690> does<00:01:16.870> not<00:01:17.140> work<00:01:17.640> let's<00:01:18.690> get<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.900> little

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
that does not work let's get it a little

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.550 
that does not work let's get it a little
bit<00:01:20.200> hotter<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:22.120> see<00:01:22.990> if<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.200> works<00:01:23.350> any

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
bit hotter and see if it works any

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
bit hotter and see if it works any
better<00:01:25.079> all<00:01:26.079> right

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.459

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
hey so ivory melted it yeah I have a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.740 
hey so ivory melted it yeah I have a
close-up<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.369> what<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.759> looks<00:01:54.969> like<00:01:55.179> there<00:01:57.750> I'm

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
close-up of what it looks like there I'm

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.990 
close-up of what it looks like there I'm
gonna<00:01:58.899> pour<00:01:59.259> off<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:02.049> first<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:06.459> get<00:02:06.579> my<00:02:06.729> gun

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
gonna pour off this first you get my gun

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:20.410 
gonna pour off this first you get my gun
out<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.360> way

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920 

want<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.510> get<00:02:21.690> rid<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:23.330> hydraulic<00:02:24.330> fluid<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.900> we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
want to get rid of hydraulic fluid so we

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.170 
want to get rid of hydraulic fluid so we
don't<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> same<00:02:25.940> problem<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.000> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
don't have the same problem with it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
don't have the same problem with it
beating<00:02:27.540> us<00:02:27.690> hopefully<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.650> second<00:02:29.070> time

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
beating us hopefully on this second time

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.770 
beating us hopefully on this second time
I<00:02:29.720> also<00:02:31.130> went<00:02:32.130> ahead<00:02:35.120> heated<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.240> up<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.540> little

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
I also went ahead heated it up a little

00:02:36.780 --> 00:03:12.270 
I also went ahead heated it up a little
bit<00:02:36.930> farther

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.160 

I<00:03:12.310> wish<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.420> didn't<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.510> drew<00:03:16.720> it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
I wish I didn't so much I drew it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.530 
I wish I didn't so much I drew it
in<00:03:17.290> there<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:17.890> know<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.220> gotta<00:03:18.430> keep<00:03:19.330> it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
in there but you know you gotta keep it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.900 
in there but you know you gotta keep it
from<00:03:19.690> oxidizing

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:34.190 

do<00:03:27.910> what<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.180> can<00:03:31.890> see<00:03:32.890> if<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.610> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
do what you can see if I can get you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.449 
do what you can see if I can get you
closer<00:03:36.209> there<00:03:37.209> goes<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.040> looks

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
closer there goes that what that looks

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
closer there goes that what that looks
like<00:03:39.550> there<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> inside<00:03:46.050> that's<00:03:47.050> just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
like there on the inside that's just

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.340 
like there on the inside that's just
pure<00:03:47.650> sodium<00:03:48.420> other<00:03:49.420> than<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.989> little<00:03:50.230> bit<00:03:50.320> of

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
pure sodium other than a little bit of

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.560 
pure sodium other than a little bit of
hydraulic<00:03:50.770> red<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.940> skin<00:03:52.360> that's

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
hydraulic red I see the skin that's

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.510 
hydraulic red I see the skin that's
happening<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> top<00:03:53.470> that's<00:03:53.709> cuz<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.220> don't

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
happening on the top that's cuz I don't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.770 
happening on the top that's cuz I don't
have<00:03:54.610> any<00:03:54.760> hydraulic<00:03:55.380> its<00:03:56.380> oxidizing<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.540> the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
have any hydraulic its oxidizing so the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.190 
have any hydraulic its oxidizing so the
hydraulic<00:04:02.110> fluid<00:04:02.350> doesn't<00:04:02.860> look<00:04:03.040> real<00:04:03.280> pretty

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.570 

nice<00:04:08.200> thing<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.770> really<00:04:08.980> doesn't<00:04:09.190> react

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
nice thing is it really doesn't react

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.670 
nice thing is it really doesn't react
with<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> sodium<00:04:10.330> keeps<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.290> from<00:04:11.470> reacting

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
with the sodium keeps it from reacting

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.570 
with the sodium keeps it from reacting
with<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.340> oceans

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
with the oceans

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.259 
with the oceans
so<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:17.260> important<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:17.919> you<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.400> make<00:04:19.060> sure

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
so it's important for you to make sure

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.870 
so it's important for you to make sure
you're<00:04:19.620> following<00:04:20.620> any<00:04:21.040> safety<00:04:21.580> precautions

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
you're following any safety precautions

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.630 
you're following any safety precautions
that<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.840> know<00:04:23.020> us<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.530> try<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.040> find<00:04:24.280> out<00:04:24.490> as

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
that you know us and try to find out as

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.500 
that you know us and try to find out as
many<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.150> do

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
many as you do

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.030 
many as you do
you<00:04:25.750> can't<00:04:26.020> find<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:28.150> you'll<00:04:28.450> notice<00:04:29.040> I'm

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
you can't find so you'll notice I'm

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.030 
you can't find so you'll notice I'm
wearing<00:04:30.190> face<00:04:30.580> shield<00:04:30.910> heavy<00:04:31.300> gloves<00:04:32.040> Nomex

wearing face shield heavy gloves Nomex
fire<00:04:33.340> suit<00:04:38.070> well<00:04:39.070> let's<00:04:39.220> wait<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.850> to

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
fire suit well let's wait for that to

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.380 
fire suit well let's wait for that to
set<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.600> little<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:40.960> longer<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:42.150> I'll<00:04:43.150> see

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
set up a little bit longer and I'll see

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.600 
set up a little bit longer and I'll see
what<00:04:43.419> happens
