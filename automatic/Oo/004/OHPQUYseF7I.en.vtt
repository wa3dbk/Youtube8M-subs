00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
done we're going to show you how to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.530 
done we're going to show you how to
export<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.610> where<00:01:56.850> it'll<00:01:57.030> work<00:01:57.210> pretty

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
export this to where it'll work pretty

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.380 
export this to where it'll work pretty
much<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> same<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.700> we're<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.299> up

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
much the same way we're going to go up

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.590 
much the same way we're going to go up
to<00:02:00.540> file<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.549> export<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> were<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to file and export just as if it were a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.560 
to file and export just as if it were a
JPEG

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
JPEG

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.380 
JPEG
but<00:02:06.260> rather<00:02:06.470> than<00:02:06.800> choose<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.070> JPEG<00:02:07.640> we<00:02:08.210> are

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
but rather than choose a JPEG we are

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.610 
but rather than choose a JPEG we are
going<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.750> choose<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.920> PDF<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.170> then<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
going to choose a PDF and then in the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.670 
going to choose a PDF and then in the
general<00:02:13.300> we<00:02:14.300> are<00:02:14.450> gonna<00:02:14.630> choose<00:02:14.930> resolution

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
general we are gonna choose resolution

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.560 
general we are gonna choose resolution
300<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.450> we're<00:02:17.570> gonna<00:02:17.660> go<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> pages<00:02:18.140> and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
300 and we're gonna go to pages and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.530 
300 and we're gonna go to pages and
we're<00:02:20.570> gonna<00:02:20.660> choose<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.650> page<00:02:21.890> range

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
we're gonna choose the page range

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.030 
we're gonna choose the page range
example<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.860> there's<00:02:25.930> 134<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.800> want<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
example now there's 134 we don't want to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.320 
example now there's 134 we don't want to
do<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.640> would<00:02:28.880> take<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.090> long

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
do that because that would take a long

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.900 
do that because that would take a long
time<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:30.230> export<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.130> we're<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.280> gonna<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.640> 1

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
time to export so we're just gonna do 1

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.210
