this is Dave from discount shop and
today<00:00:08.870> we're<00:00:09.080> going<00:00:09.170> to<00:00:09.230> look<00:00:09.380> at<00:00:09.560> a<00:00:09.590> Seiko

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
today we're going to look at a Seiko

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.230 
today we're going to look at a Seiko
divers<00:00:10.610> watch

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
divers watch

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.810 
divers watch
so<00:00:11.780> this<00:00:11.960> watch<00:00:12.140> comes<00:00:12.500> with<00:00:12.800> the<00:00:13.040> original<00:00:13.670> la

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
so this watch comes with the original la

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.390 
so this watch comes with the original la
psycho<00:00:14.210> manual<00:00:14.960> and<00:00:15.170> packaging<00:00:15.680> here<00:00:15.890> I'll

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
psycho manual and packaging here I'll

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.960 
psycho manual and packaging here I'll
just<00:00:16.579> unbox<00:00:16.999> it<00:00:17.179> so<00:00:17.329> you<00:00:17.419> can<00:00:17.570> take<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.749> look<00:00:21.970> so

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
just unbox it so you can take a look so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.019 
just unbox it so you can take a look so
this<00:00:22.999> is<00:00:23.449> a<00:00:23.480> kinetic<00:00:24.140> divers<00:00:24.829> watch<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:25.909> we'll

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
this is a kinetic divers watch and we'll

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.419 
this is a kinetic divers watch and we'll
talk<00:00:26.269> a<00:00:26.300> bit<00:00:26.480> about<00:00:26.659> the<00:00:27.230> kinetic<00:00:27.919> movement<00:00:28.369> in

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
talk a bit about the kinetic movement in

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.979 
talk a bit about the kinetic movement in
just<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.730> minute<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.179> let<00:00:29.269> me<00:00:29.390> zoom<00:00:29.539> in<00:00:29.749> so<00:00:29.899> you

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
just a minute but let me zoom in so you

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.500 
just a minute but let me zoom in so you
can<00:00:30.140> just<00:00:30.259> get<00:00:30.409> a<00:00:30.470> first<00:00:30.739> impression<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.510> the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
can just get a first impression of the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.430 
can just get a first impression of the
watch<00:00:32.689> itself<00:00:33.880> it's<00:00:34.880> simple<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.290> it's

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
watch itself it's simple but it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.420 
watch itself it's simple but it's
elegant<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.720> you<00:00:38.720> know<00:00:38.840> it's<00:00:39.770> easy<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.130> read

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
elegant and you know it's easy to read

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.790 
elegant and you know it's easy to read
which<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:40.730> important<00:00:41.150> for<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.330> diver's<00:00:41.720> watch

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
which is important for a diver's watch

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.200 
which is important for a diver's watch
so<00:00:42.800> we'll<00:00:43.100> start<00:00:43.310> off<00:00:43.430> by<00:00:43.580> talking<00:00:43.640> about<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
so we'll start off by talking about the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.390 
so we'll start off by talking about the
movement<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:44.810> this<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.170> an<00:00:45.260> analog<00:00:45.770> quartz

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
movement so this is an analog quartz

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.640 
movement so this is an analog quartz
movement<00:00:46.940> but<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:47.450> equipped<00:00:47.810> with<00:00:47.990> kinetic

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
movement but it's equipped with kinetic

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.040 
movement but it's equipped with kinetic
technology<00:00:49.430> developed<00:00:50.000> by<00:00:50.090> Seiko<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:50.870> what

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
technology developed by Seiko so what

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.320 
technology developed by Seiko so what
that<00:00:51.200> means<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.710> basically<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:52.490> generates

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
that means is basically it generates

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.500 
that means is basically it generates
electric<00:00:54.020> energy

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
electric energy

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.850 
electric energy
utilizing<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.600> movement<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.170> your<00:00:57.350> arm<00:00:57.560> and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
utilizing the movement of your arm and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.460 
utilizing the movement of your arm and
it<00:00:58.490> stores<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.970> energy<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.750> rechargeable

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
it stores that energy in a rechargeable

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.380 
it stores that energy in a rechargeable
battery<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.130> battery<00:01:01.400> is<00:01:01.970> what<00:01:02.150> power

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
battery and that battery is what power

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.420 
battery and that battery is what power
is<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.690> watch<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.740> it's<00:01:03.890> not<00:01:04.009> an<00:01:04.129> automatic

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
is the watch so it's not an automatic

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.420 
is the watch so it's not an automatic
movement<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.800> powered<00:01:06.800> by<00:01:06.830> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
movement but it is powered by the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.240 
movement but it is powered by the
movement<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.060> your<00:01:08.210> arm<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.320> unusual<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
movement of your arm so it's unusual and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.480 
movement of your arm so it's unusual and
it's<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.670> it's<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.120> great<00:01:11.330> Seiko<00:01:11.930> innovation<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's a it's a great Seiko innovation and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.530 
it's a it's a great Seiko innovation and
it<00:01:13.820> means<00:01:13.940> you<00:01:14.090> never<00:01:14.180> need<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.480> replace

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
it means you never need to replace

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.050 
it means you never need to replace
batteries<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.310> itself<00:01:16.670> is

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
batteries so that in and of itself is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.360 
batteries so that in and of itself is
some<00:01:17.330> is<00:01:17.600> really<00:01:18.229> great<00:01:18.530> value<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.010> you<00:01:19.070> don't

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
some is really great value and you don't

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.550 
some is really great value and you don't
need<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.940> worry<00:01:20.210> about<00:01:20.570> going<00:01:20.720> on<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:20.990> dive<00:01:21.260> and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
need to worry about going on a dive and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.170 
need to worry about going on a dive and
having<00:01:21.830> your<00:01:21.950> watch<00:01:22.130> battery<00:01:22.370> die<00:01:22.820> that's

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
having your watch battery die that's

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.260 
having your watch battery die that's
another<00:01:23.390> important<00:01:23.870> thing<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:25.060> let's<00:01:26.060> take<00:01:26.240> a

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
another important thing so let's take a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.969 
another important thing so let's take a
look<00:01:26.479> there<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.750> date<00:01:27.080> window<00:01:27.530> here<00:01:27.770> at<00:01:27.890> the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
look there is a date window here at the

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.649 
look there is a date window here at the
three<00:01:28.220> o'clock<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.820> pretty<00:01:29.030> small<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
three o'clock it's pretty small it's a

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.050 
three o'clock it's pretty small it's a
little<00:01:29.870> bit<00:01:29.990> hard<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.290> read<00:01:30.620> that's<00:01:31.490> one<00:01:31.700> small

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
little bit hard to read that's one small

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.149 
little bit hard to read that's one small
critique<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:32.780> my<00:01:32.930> part<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.320> think<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.770> know<00:01:33.860> for

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
critique on my part I think you know for

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.800 
critique on my part I think you know for
a<00:01:34.220> diver's<00:01:34.610> watch<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.060> want<00:01:35.299> it<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.450> be<00:01:35.540> really

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
a diver's watch you want it to be really

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.810 
a diver's watch you want it to be really
easy<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.140> read<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:36.500> from<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> distance<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.430> don't

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
easy to read but from a distance I don't

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.160 
easy to read but from a distance I don't
know<00:01:37.970> how<00:01:38.090> easy<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.720> see<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:38.990> date

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
know how easy it is to see the date

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630 
know how easy it is to see the date
although<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:39.799> important<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.460> while

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
although how important is that while

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880 
although how important is that while
you're<00:01:40.790> underwater<00:01:41.229> what<00:01:42.229> is<00:01:42.350> important<00:01:42.799> of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
you're underwater what is important of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.710 
you're underwater what is important of
course<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.460> unidirectional<00:01:43.790> ratcheting

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
course is the unidirectional ratcheting

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.690 
course is the unidirectional ratcheting
bezel<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.860> feature<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.369> see<00:01:46.400> on

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
bezel this is a feature that you see on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.930 
bezel this is a feature that you see on
most<00:01:46.880> dive<00:01:47.180> watches<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.110> really<00:01:48.320> is<00:01:48.560> very

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
most dive watches but it really is very

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.940 
most dive watches but it really is very
important<00:01:49.940> because<00:01:50.119> obviously<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.320> can<00:01:51.500> set

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950
