00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this is making increases now for every

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.110 
this is making increases now for every

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
yarn over

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560 
yarn over
that's<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.289> increased<00:00:58.800> stitch<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.329> work

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that's an increased stitch in our work

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:10.359

or now we come to the next year Nova
stitch<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.430> just<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.480> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
stitch here just like as if it were a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
stitch here just like as if it were a
normal<00:01:45.780> stitch<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.600> Yellin<00:01:48.930> over<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.979> two

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
normal stitch and so Yellin over do two

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.540 
normal stitch and so Yellin over do two
things<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:52.700> make<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:53.820> increase<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.040> we

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
things they make an increase so now we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250 
things they make an increase so now we
have<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:56.970> stitches<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> our<00:01:57.690> needle<00:01:57.900> than<00:01:58.140> we

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
have more stitches on our needle than we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.310 
have more stitches on our needle than we
did<00:01:58.380> before<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.270> they<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.510> make<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.080> little

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
did before and they also make a little

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.770 
did before and they also make a little
hole<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> fabric<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:05.420> use<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.600> lot

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
hole in the fabric so that's use a lot

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.550 
hole in the fabric so that's use a lot
in<00:02:07.050> life<00:02:07.500> knitting<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.000> using<00:02:09.720> yarn<00:02:09.929> owes<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
in life knitting but using yarn owes to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
in life knitting but using yarn owes to
create<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.070> holes<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> fabric<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
create the holes in the fabric so it's

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
create the holes in the fabric so it's
an<00:02:12.930> increase<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> creates<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.070> hole<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.640> now

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
an increase that creates a hole so now

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.120 
an increase that creates a hole so now
you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.380> these<00:02:16.560> holes<00:02:16.890> in

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
you can see here we have these holes in

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.160 
you can see here we have these holes in
the<00:02:17.250> fabric<00:02:17.870> where<00:02:18.870> our<00:02:19.140> yarn<00:02:19.440> overs<00:02:19.860> with
