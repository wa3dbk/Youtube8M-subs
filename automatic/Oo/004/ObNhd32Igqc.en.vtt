this<00:03:28.550> game<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.180> think<00:03:29.420> if<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.660> game<00:03:29.840> was

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
this game and I think if this game was

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.140 
this game and I think if this game was
going<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.200> be<00:03:30.350> an<00:03:30.830> easy<00:03:31.070> game<00:03:31.220> but<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.700> made<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.090> a

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
going to be an easy game but I made it a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.660 
going to be an easy game but I made it a
hard<00:03:32.360> game<00:03:32.600> because<00:03:32.960> i<00:03:33.110> wasn't<00:03:33.320> i<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.370> wasn't
