00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 o'hare 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.060
 hello to all and all those who work today we find ourselves 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.800
 for episode number 9 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 from my town in a binder a pretty special episode well because 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.350
 it's just the video part on the channel 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.720
 so the chain I started in February and 1% I want to talk about life 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 we do not care but I mean anyway 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.890
 it started in February I really started posting a video 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.020
 % m minard saint-georges I deposited my first video in February already 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.830
 janique stopped because I had problems with so much zeal with will 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.870
 sanctioned and that's fine so finally the pressure is on us 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.830
 and since then 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 late March finally because I really started posting videos so 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.130
 ending in marseille 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.629
 the royal hall march 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.210
 and that makes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.019
 three big weeks that I make videos - 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.660
 so that calor bottom 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.780
 kunming faster 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.070
 and I eat at areva I think that slab 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.640
 that while digging to abolish but I'm really happy 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 2% and novartis of people who like videos so 26% and I was able to start 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.820
 to vote for me 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.880
 nowadays paris 14 dec 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 it's true I do not care because it's nice to make videos from 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.100
 the portal and some people she was pleased to watch it from 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 from time to time and who are subscribers 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.860
 that's good for what I had to say and then second thing eat 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.049
 it's great tonight 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.530
 we are on vacation strong the cadastre chamakh in internship 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.560
 I live in the order of 7% 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.950
 if you go to any page I'm from a second area to be on vacation 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.280
 monday I would locate who have been on vacation for a week 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.170
 and so I'm too happy I'm on vacation so sic full full full 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 full of videos 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.930
 I use it a lot to enjoy these holidays for 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.579
 speak 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.630
 plant a plan you can which short videos that for those who me 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.110
 follow 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.220
 a little later it's difficult and I do not care but we'll start everything from 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.619
 following a meal offered expectations 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.369
 what has changed since then we are well in the halls 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.850
 and $ 1 55 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.689
 I added 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.670
 on the way then 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.290
 we're just going to discover what's hiding 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.490
 so you see I have two wagons end of real cards so I think you 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.030
 have 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.209
 position to discuss what's going on at the foot 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.149
 I added 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.739
 a metro to see it 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.769
 so imagine in the end and yes here is that metro with a booster a 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.969
 only way in posture that does not solicit just like that for 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:21.709
 round trip 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.629
 here we go 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.589
 for now the situation is about sensitivities 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.359
 he is very common upward on his rise this party 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.099
 and that's what it takes 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.279
 what is it over 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.169
 he quoted a Marseille supporter 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.129
 I sent it otherwise you must not take it because frankly 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.069
 it is well port expression of cassation must say tortured wakamatsu 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.109
 party to an original gift will you tell me well lewis you have 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.280
 definitely government does not care about it completely 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.629
 so why what I chose this name 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.999
 equipped with world missiles against 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.419
 while president 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.619
 m why what i read a lot laughed because i have no inspiration for 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.039
 No I'm sorry I'm I'm not very strong more and why not 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.110
 very good just as you can see in the way down to 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.390
 to do the sea ocean I do not really know if it's necessary 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.579
 I think it's a life that starts 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.470
 very little old love we'll say goodbye with the cooks 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.780
 to achieve this 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.810
 a town hall a library and the amisom it was missing a banker that I'm going 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.689
 add like that each time after 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.100
 in every city as you could see the league 1 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.849
 there were ten candles mine 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.239
 it's a hotel a city where I put an amphitheater what a little 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.229
 little bigger 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.099
 % of my life there in the week that I made a choice from this factory 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.159
 swimming pool 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.439
 open other pawns that are available to you 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.349
 gold what I look like a little thing I'm trying to do anything 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.099
 when anywhere awesome report to be able to go explore a little bit more 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.340
 away will leave 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.800
 in search of adventure and thrills Sunday together 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.950
 so we started to visit 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.510
 so first thing to see the freedom gained with whom 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.000
 the stuff the biggest objects arrays and I managed to make it appear then 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.599
 that I did not know that we could not really abstain from the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.049
 base then on a pig's head 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.509
 then with deficits in the standard 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:12.149
 we see one if it was the first tests on endless road 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.479
 then we will go 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.840
 my father 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.190
 the mayor then the mayor the microscopic a study conducted by a 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.469
 breakfast training it's a list 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.659
 and it's really for 7000 people who passed 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 and that is it is hardly the line 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.620
 what can I say that the mayor in her childhood the blonde but also in 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.039
 February then we dance 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.449
 and we end up in front of a giant billboard with you in there 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.449
 same time 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.900
 during questions to the government 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.979
 with india 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.349
 m different frame so why I did that and it's not good live 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.699
 I want to hate impossible to reach by a crowd of onlookers 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.090
 of different tables earlier taboo the appropriate term 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.400
 some institutions have, for their part, gone back a little 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.650
 alas there is nothing why will you tell me why could besides 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.919
 see start a new record of losses and profits from the space that is 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:09.789
 the 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.789
 to be able to put vitreans felt them more light 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.689
 why and signals simply because we ourselves are even more 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.949
 exact of this piece this focus which is very small and head of 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.270
 Tibetan file 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.599
 to sprinkle the map of the two little sons like this why simply 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.410
 explore this map and it has the wax card that I write with lolo 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.860
 in generators 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.840
 invite you to the end because it's really great then 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.310
 why this fight do together and well just because in the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.530
 next video club so exceptional and time video on the 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.860
 chain 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.120
 I will teach you bring your house with furniture stamps that 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
 we can do for example 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.129
 a fridge 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.150
 united when the stuff that does not actually work but I hope decorative 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.469
 we can also play upwind how to craft January 10th that serve to 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:53.659
 something to hide 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.989
 sorry a few steps something so I had a bed for example a 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.719
 workshop that can be used to make a carpet is not learned to attend 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:00.680
 title 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.690
 we are living things and things 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.889
 purely aesthetic things 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.180
 we must not linger known as his farm and fix the sins 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.850
 clement very narrow and three buildings around adds network of 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.030
 bus in order to complete a little disappointed as you can see it's 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.949
 a bit empty 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.069
 in ten years 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.490
 I was really very very long stairs 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.809
 the stairs 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.059
 while cobol jussie scathing cobalt to change some wood because 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.249
 our all that the first three planes all I did until 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.360
 this is a joy if we are going to change a bit because afterwards already within 

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:33.089
 the cei and especially more than people found it bad that I made wood 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.620
 all over 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.870
 so I put some guinea pig 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.590
 how this service is great so as we can see it's the body 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.060
 avery is not nice microscopic I know nothing I call it a little bit 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.659
 could say a pontoon rather like a fishing pontoon 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:44.610
 I do not practice 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.449
 g I think we can say that it's like that 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.610
 there is I rely on the earth is a video that is especially for you 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.320
 djinnit which is used especially to alzon shown well being 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.979
 the six presidents the eu 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.339
 louis les cistudes the fourth worst than anything I'm going to improve everything 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.779
 just who will be the subject of a video of course I will also come back in 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.409
 the amphitheater gillette targets heroic Libyan I had I 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:06.689
 also improved 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.960
 if you have not seen that it's a little late to say it and videos intended 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.510
 from the city of feet at an age where the costs are of course seeing them 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.410
 what I'm explaining to you again the principle of this bonus in each 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.039
 video 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.930
 the purpose of this series simply to inspire you a spirou of what m 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.300
 inspire you from what I'm doing it's surely the booty start then two 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.259
 waves of three sites to the teeth 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:28.669
 in the videos leave the possibility account when I think about it 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:29.319
 here 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.229
 I hope you enjoyed it and I was there 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.469
 for the real is the day of delays and meatballs to recite not 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:35.480
 do not hesitate 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.360
 go for a ride on the 10% physical chain and in my friends list 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.849
 you too have proven tracks without 13 I'm not sure of the world at the 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:44.389
 end I think it's just that we get 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.259
 you need more to see the videos of great night with different 

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.530
 really great sources 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.670
 a little more with the subscriber your civilian passages if you have the time 

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.479
 because frankly 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.830
 six Iraqis he says frankly so royal didier vassal 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.919
 it's nice that I allow you to follow and video that will be possible 

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:01.840
 so regularly that's it I hope it will want more than we 

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.600
 found well 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.490
 very very soon I think I'll shoot the next video just 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.090
 after the finish to do on the titan 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.290
 and then even if the door is good it's August 7th
