 a container is a cargo container for shipping 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.429
 land or air 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.509
 To facilitate handling, the dimensions of the containers are 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.519
 regulated by the international standard apartment 6346 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 by extension it is called container to a large packaging 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.930
 used to transport bulky or crossed objects 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.160
 engines 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 machinery 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.080
 vehicles 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.560
 the containers are transported in specialized ships in their handling the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 which are called container ships 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 They are manufactured with standard measurements 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.830
 in regards to its length there are two main versions the 20 foot six 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.320
 points 0 8 meters 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 and the one of 40 feet twelve points 19 meters 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.730
 They are manufactured with eight feet two points 44 meters wide by the ponchos feet with 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.290
 6 inches two points 59 meters high also existing the version of 9 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.730
 feet with 6 inches two points hundred meters high 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.090
 these in turn are classified according to their characteristics in containers 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 common or dry cargo 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 open or pinto 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.230
 refrigerated 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.460
 thermal or insulating floors 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010
 cistern or tank 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.020
 and flat rate 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.510
 the containers are usually made mainly of steel but also 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.810
 there are aluminum 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.000
 and some other plywood 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 reinforced with fiberglass 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.140
 in most cases the salary is made of wood, although there are already some 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.030
 bamboo 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.500
 internally wear a special anti-moisture coating to avoid 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.380
 effect during the trip 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.170
 Another defining characteristic of containers is the presence in each 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 of their corners of accommodations for Christians that allow them to be 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.130
 hooked by special cranes as well as its 30 h both in boats and in 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.949
 trucks ofer rails 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.199
 the most widespread in the world are the 20 and 40 feet equipment 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.269
 with an approximate internal volume of 32 points six cubic meters and 66 points 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.379
 7 cubic meters respectively 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.569
 The unit of measurement of maritime transport capacity in containers is 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.849
 the tedÃ©um from the English expression tuenti fuste team 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.939
 screenwriters 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.759
 this is the size that has been established as a base taking as unit 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.799
 the capacity of a 20-foot container 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.799
 apart from the 20-foot container that is computed as a TV 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.799
 there is the variant of the 40-foot container 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.079
 both on the coast and equivalents tired of it
