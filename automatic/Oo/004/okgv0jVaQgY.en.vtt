00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.230
Welcome on netbooknews.it! This is the review
for the latest 11.6 inch Acer netbook, the

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.330
Aspire One 722.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.400
This model will be available from July, in
two versions, with starting sale price at

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.400
299 euros/dollars.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.949
It has a 11.6 inch screen, AMD C50 Ontario
platform installed, 320 Gb hard disk,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.560
2 or 3 Gb of RAM memory, and a 6 cells battery
that, like we’ll see then in the tests,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.109
allows an impressive operating time.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.140
The ports endowment it’s pretty standard,
on the right side we have two USB ports, microphone

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
and earphones output, and the multi-size SD
card reader.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.020
On the left side the third and last 2.0 USB
port, the HDMI and the VGA output to connect

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.010
the netbook to an external monitor or TV,
and the Ethernet port.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.000
You see that on the back there’s nothing
but this panel that allows the access to RAM

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.780
memory and hard disk. But, we’ll see then,
you have to remove the keyboard to do all

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.780
this.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.100
On the front we have only the system led,
here on the left.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.619
The touchpad is configured with the multi-touch
function, and the keyboard is the chiclet

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:23.210
model, although with the usual Acer configuration
that’s in some way different from the rivals.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.749
The screen is the glossy type, with a resolution
of 1366 x 768 px.

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:33.850
The ac power, like others Acer products, is
the type to connect at the wall socket, you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.889
see here is the removable plug (this is the
European model) the wire is long enough,

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.890
but the ac power is bigger than the rival’s
ones.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.071
This product introduces in Italy the new Acer
design, with new finishes. You can see the

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:58.179
peculiarity of the lid, with a water drop-like
pattern, and Aspire One wrote in the center.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.829
It’s pleasing to the touch, but because
it’s the glossy type we have some problems

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.659
with the finger marks.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.830
Compared with the previous series, the product’s
features have been renovated, with beveled

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.730
edge and thin surface.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.660
The pre-installed operating system is Windows
7 Home Premium 64 bit, with many pre-installed

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.240
applications, as can be the program to manage
the webcam up there.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.090
Despite the presence of the AMD platform,
we don’t have any kind of software for the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.550
power management, except Catalyst Control
Center of the Radeon graphics card.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.700
The APU AMD C50 allows us to easy play HD
videos. We’re now seeing a 1080p mp4, with

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.890
hardware acceleration switched on, as you
can see down here, and the load of the CPU

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.820
is at 20-25 % because it’s all loaded on
the graphics card.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.090
The same is with film’s trailer in local
1080p source or Youtube 720p streaming.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.710
So we can play 720p and 1080p videos, though
with some limitations.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.500
Leaving aside the multimedia and talking about
the productivity, let’s start testing this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.600
product. Now we have many open tabs in the
browser,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.430
we are downloading Skype, Wi-Fi connected
and the virus checker it’s working;

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.800
that said, we can see that the scrolling,
the system response time and the windows graphic

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.780
effects are still good.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:30.610
In terms of performances, we almost gain the
results of the Atom N550 with ION NG 8-core

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.170
version, the less powerful one installed for
example on the EeePC 1015PN.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:47.130
To know benchmarks and additional details
I invite you to take a look at the review

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.410
linked at this video.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.030
Aspire One 722 has a 6 cells battery 4400
mAh and although, lower than some rivals,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.500
gains good results in the tests.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.110
I reached 6 hours and a half while browsing
the web, with brightness at 40%;

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.350
7 hours and 22 minutes browsing the web, brightness
at 0% that anyway allows us to use the netbook

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.930
for example in dark environments;

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.450
4 hours and 42 minutes playing HD videos;

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.030
3 hours and 14 minutes playing games and so
with the processor at 100%.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:20.970
Actually we have the energy benefits of the
Atom processor, with the power of a dedicated

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.079
graphics card.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.440
Then, we came up at strengths and weaknesses:

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.630
In my opinion, in the strengths we can mention
the possibility to open the netbook and bend

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.410
the screen almost to 180 degrees,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:47.490
and that allows us to have always the best
visual for example while writing; the performances

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.730
are good too, but above all are good the power
consumption and the sale price,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.870
because 299 euros / dollars with the basic
configuration it’s a very good deal.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:08.270
But we have to stop to compromise: have a
netbook with a constructive quality that is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.270
not the best on sale,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:29.750
above all for the finishes that are not as
good as other models that take more care in

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.750
details;

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.870
then, the viewing angles on the sides are
good, but you see that on the top and the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.200
bottom we have sensible distortion of color
and contrast.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:58.220
But I still don’t understand why it seems
impossible to set a panel, on the back of

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.900
the netbook, to access if not the hard disk,
at least the RAM memory to increase it.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.510
But as things are, we must remove the keyboard
and some screws and then completely take off

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.510
the panel.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.340
At last here is, personally speaking, the
main weakness of this product, I mean this

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:34.790
keyboard that not only flexes in the middle
but also have some problems with 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.070
the keys,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:47.639
although large_ you see 
the right shift and the space-bar they wobble

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.510
a little especially in the middle,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.040
and so you always have the impression to take
a look to see what key you are pressing.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.660
A netbook like this, however, aim at being
more practical than showy, and for this reason

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.400
I guess it’s a good product,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.020
with impressive battery life and reasonable
performances for its genre.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.620
That’s all, I invite you to read the complete

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.540
