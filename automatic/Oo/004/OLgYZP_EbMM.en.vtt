00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.450
Very good start.

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:17.575
I couldn't overtake.

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.152
Attacking from outside
here, that's impossible.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:27.642
Maybe here at the downhill.

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:30.322
Nope, can't overtake.

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:38.163
I have to be careful, because this car
is borrowed from one of our viewers.

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:43.906
What about this straight. Aagh,
can't overtake on the outside.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.748
It's impossible on the outside.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.763
Hattori behind me, is looking
to have more potential.

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.622
Overtaking here is impossible.

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:08.692
Well there's only this famous climbing
section where I could overtake.

00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:10.169
Aah VTEC...

00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:11.900
is working?

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.680
The Civic is quick enough.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.007
Just as I though I can overtake now.

00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.838
From both sides! His
engine is pretty torquey.

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.124
The engine of new Inte R.

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:30.853
But the cornering is about the same.

00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:35.895
I'm definitely not losing in corners.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.857
I'm not losing, I'm faster here.

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:46.839
This is probably because
of weight difference.

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:53.628
From now on there's the
climbing straight section.

00:01:54.194 --> 00:02:00.371
When I enter the 3rd gear, there's not a big
difference here, at the short straight.

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:05.419
But the corner, mine was
definitely faster here.

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:11.981
But his straight speed is faster.

00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:15.086
Because of gear ratios?

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.998
I'm at his tail in corners.

00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:24.776
Now it's the game of i-VTEC.

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.289
His climbing at this straight is faster.

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:31.248
It's the new i-VTEC.

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:35.082
The engine has very little torque dips.

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:43.134
Anyway I'm getting closer in this corner.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.389
The cornering performance of the new version
is probably influenced by added weight.

00:02:56.563 --> 00:03:01.325
But because his car is new the engine
is still not broken in properly.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:06.459
Is this only the difference
of engine performance?

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.821
But my Inte's engine is also a bit heavy with
just 10,000 km on the clock, not broken in yet.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.812
Though the cornering is
more or less the same.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.758
Anyway this is just a mid speed
track, it would be probably

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:31.811
different story at higher
speed track such as Suzuka.

00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:42.485
This last climbing section on
Ebisu is strong point of i-VTEC.

00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:46.945
My Rpm stops climbing at about
7000rpm then he pulls away.
