00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
right now haven't really thought of what

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.180 
right now haven't really thought of what
else<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.210> head<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.390> upstairs

and<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:39.000> sure<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.450> doing<00:00:40.190> different

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and I'm not sure if I'm doing different

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.540 
and I'm not sure if I'm doing different
themes<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:42.120> rooms<00:00:42.950> for<00:00:43.950> each<00:00:44.070> floor<00:00:44.370> or

there<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.600> anyways<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> best

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there but anyways this is the best

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
there but anyways this is the best
placement<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.180> bathroom<00:00:54.690> area<00:00:55.170> and
