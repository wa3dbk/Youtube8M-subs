I'm gonna put this in here and see if it
fixes<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:42.899> starting<00:00:43.440> issue

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
fixes my starting issue

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
fixes my starting issue
I'll<00:00:44.850> check<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> battery<00:00:45.450> voltage<00:00:45.480> I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I'll check the battery voltage I've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
I'll check the battery voltage I've
charged<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> battery<00:00:46.980> I've<00:00:47.250> used<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
charged the battery I've used the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
charged the battery I've used the
battery<00:00:47.850> charger<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> try<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> give<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
battery charger to try and give the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
battery charger to try and give the
system<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.579> amperage<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.289> still

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
system more amperage and it still

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
system more amperage and it still
doesn't<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> crank<00:00:53.870> because<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
doesn't want to crank because the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
doesn't want to crank because the
starter<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:56.070> completely<00:00:56.550> underwater<00:00:56.879> for

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
starter was completely underwater for

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
starter was completely underwater for
over<00:00:58.020> two<00:00:58.710> hours<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:02.160> tried

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
over two hours I think and I tried

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.710 
over two hours I think and I tried
starting<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.120> underwater<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> uh

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
starting it well as underwater so uh

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.679 
starting it well as underwater so uh
pretty<00:01:06.720> sure<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> starter<00:01:07.380> shop<00:01:08.360> Hut<00:01:09.360> opens

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pretty sure the starter shop Hut opens

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
pretty sure the starter shop Hut opens
 two<00:01:10.290> hands<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.010> two

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

everything's very muddy
oh<00:01:20.509> yeah<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> engine<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:22.140> also<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
oh yeah the engine was also for that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
oh yeah the engine was also for that
might<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.720> helped<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.200> yeah<00:01:26.070> we're

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
might have not helped at all yeah we're

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
might have not helped at all yeah we're
gonna<00:01:26.310> replace<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> starter<00:01:27.650> safety

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
gonna replace the starter safety

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.090 
gonna replace the starter safety
precautions<00:01:30.229> your<00:01:31.229> starter<00:01:31.740> at

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
precautions your starter at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
precautions your starter at
least<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.670> mount<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> Cherokee<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
least on this mount of Cherokee the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.319 
least on this mount of Cherokee the
positive<00:01:35.159> cable<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> battery<00:01:35.939> goes

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
positive cable from the battery goes

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
positive cable from the battery goes
directly<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> starter<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.340> might<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
directly to the starter so it might be a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
directly to the starter so it might be a
good<00:01:38.909> idea<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.360> disconnect<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
good idea to disconnect one of the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
good idea to disconnect one of the
terminals<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.460> shock<00:01:42.090> yourself<00:01:42.119> or

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
terminals see don't shock yourself or

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.560 
terminals see don't shock yourself or
other<00:01:43.110> fun<00:01:43.380> thanks<00:01:43.880> alright<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.060> business

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
other fun thanks alright down business

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
other fun thanks alright down business
underneath<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.159> two

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
underneath there there's gonna be two

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.230 
underneath there there's gonna be two
wires<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.060> positive<00:01:48.420> cable<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
wires the positive cable and I think the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.520 
wires the positive cable and I think the
switch<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.350> start<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:54.000> starter<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
switch to start it the starter so you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
switch to start it the starter so you
disconnect<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> wires<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> pull

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
disconnect the wires and you can pull

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.760 
disconnect the wires and you can pull
the<00:01:57.689> starter<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.320> bolts<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the starter out with two bolts so I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
the starter out with two bolts so I
think<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> fourteen<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> 15

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
think it's a fourteen and a 15

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
think it's a fourteen and a 15
millimeter<00:02:00.270> something<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
millimeter something like that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.090 
millimeter something like that
sure<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> want<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.520> under<00:02:02.640> there

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
sure you want to get under there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.190 
sure you want to get under there
all<00:02:04.190> right<00:02:04.550> here<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.000> are<00:02:05.180> from<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.990> front

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
all right here we are from the front

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.469 
all right here we are from the front
vehicle<00:02:06.380> looking<00:02:06.890> back<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:08.030> passenger

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
vehicle looking back on the passenger

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.380 
vehicle looking back on the passenger
side<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.229> starter<00:02:09.500> motor<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.120> one<00:02:11.330> of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
side is the starter motor that is one of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.449 
side is the starter motor that is one of
the<00:02:11.450> bolts<00:02:11.630> right<00:02:11.840> there<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.920> can't<00:02:13.190> see

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the bolts right there and I can't see

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.260 
the bolts right there and I can't see
any<00:02:13.580> other<00:02:13.700> bolt

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
any other bolt

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.900 
any other bolt
I'm<00:02:14.870> pretty<00:02:15.080> sure<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> back<00:02:16.250> but

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
I'm pretty sure it's in the back but

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.699 
I'm pretty sure it's in the back but
there's<00:02:17.330> those<00:02:17.570> connections<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.260> was<00:02:18.350> talking

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
there's those connections I was talking

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.180 
there's those connections I was talking
about<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.080> lost<00:02:21.320> them<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> we<00:02:21.950> should<00:02:22.130> be

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
about so I lost them and we should be

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
still has water in it exciting it's a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:34.600 
still has water in it exciting it's a
key<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.610> want<00:02:56.030> to<00:03:13.750> yeah<00:03:33.220> yep<00:03:34.220> near<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.300 

so<00:03:46.960> uh<00:03:46.990> yeah<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.860> looks<00:03:48.010> lovely<00:03:50.130> mmm

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
so uh yeah that looks lovely mmm

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.200 
so uh yeah that looks lovely mmm
so<00:03:51.520> does<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:54.270> so<00:03:55.270> uh<00:03:55.300> yeah<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.090> do<00:03:58.180> a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
so does that so uh yeah you can do a

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.740 
so does that so uh yeah you can do a
test<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.870> see<00:03:59.080> if<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.320> works<00:04:00.300> outside<00:04:01.300> of<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
test to see if it works outside of the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.090 
test to see if it works outside of the
engine<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:05.020> wire<00:04:05.230> right<00:04:05.440> here<00:04:05.500> turn<00:04:05.980> to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
engine so this wire right here turn to

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.449 
engine so this wire right here turn to
the<00:04:06.190> mower<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.390> right<00:04:07.630> here<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.459> that

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
the mower this is right here is that

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.880 
the mower this is right here is that
right<00:04:09.610> here<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.330> switch<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:14.590> entire

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
right here is the switch and the entire

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.800 
right here is the switch and the entire
system<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.430> grounded<00:04:15.820> through<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.450> body<00:04:16.630> of

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
system is grounded through the body of

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.190 
system is grounded through the body of
the<00:04:16.959> start<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> if<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.359> look<00:04:19.510> over<00:04:19.660> here<00:04:20.019> I

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
the start so if you look over here I

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.409 
the start so if you look over here I
have<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.919> positive<00:04:21.130> wire<00:04:21.519> hooked<00:04:21.910> up<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
have the positive wire hooked up like it

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.300 
have the positive wire hooked up like it
would<00:04:22.570> be<00:04:22.720> in<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.870> car<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.830> ground<00:04:23.950> just

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
would be in the car and the ground just

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.340 
would be in the car and the ground just
being<00:04:24.520> grounded<00:04:24.880> over<00:04:25.090> there<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.140> could

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
being grounded over there so you could

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.340 
being grounded over there so you could
do<00:04:26.470> two<00:04:26.650> things<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.610> can<00:04:27.790> jump<00:04:28.140> from<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
do two things you can jump from the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.530 
do two things you can jump from the
positive<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.669> this<00:04:30.910> will<00:04:30.970> start<00:04:31.360> it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
positive to this and this will start it

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.720 
positive to this and this will start it
like<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> car<00:04:32.050> would<00:04:32.230> normally<00:04:32.590> start<00:04:32.890> so<00:04:33.550> it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
like the car would normally start so it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.120 
like the car would normally start so it
activates<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.330> solenoid<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.080> turns<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
activates the solenoid and turns the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.670 
activates the solenoid and turns the
motor<00:04:36.340> if<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:37.060> jump<00:04:37.300> just<00:04:37.660> from<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.470> that

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
motor if you jump just from this to that

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.340 
motor if you jump just from this to that
it<00:04:39.040> will<00:04:39.340> turn<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.790> motor<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:40.360> not<00:04:40.600> jump<00:04:41.110> this

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
it will turn the motor but not jump this

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.409 
it will turn the motor but not jump this
solenoid<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.820> I'll<00:04:43.000> show<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.180> what<00:04:43.390> that

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
solenoid and I'll show you what that

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.250 
solenoid and I'll show you what that
means<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.050> get<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.440> camera<00:04:44.620> just<00:04:44.890> right

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
means if I can get the camera just right

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.330 
means if I can get the camera just right
there's<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.470> gear<00:04:47.919> when<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.760> is<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.130> side

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
there's the gear when it is in the side

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.440 
there's the gear when it is in the side
of<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.520> housing<00:04:54.090> trying<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.180> get<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> good

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
of the housing trying to get a good

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.370 
of the housing trying to get a good
angle<00:04:55.660> here<00:04:55.960> come<00:04:56.320> on<00:04:56.440> oh<00:04:56.860> yeah<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:59.229> if

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
angle here come on oh yeah and if

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:10.530 
angle here come on oh yeah and if
you<00:04:59.500> jump<00:04:59.770> it<00:05:00.540> do<00:05:01.540> this<00:05:08.850> but<00:05:09.850> as<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.090> notice

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
you jump it do this but as you notice

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.260 
you jump it do this but as you notice
the<00:05:10.690> motor<00:05:10.930> was<00:05:11.140> not<00:05:11.290> turning<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.820> my<00:05:12.970> motors

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
the motor was not turning so my motors

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.230 
the motor was not turning so my motors
got<00:05:13.450> enough<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.590> won't<00:05:14.770> turn

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
got enough in it that it won't turn

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.850 
got enough in it that it won't turn
that's<00:05:16.240> activating<00:05:16.810> just<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.080> motor<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.740> it

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
that's activating just the motor and it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.010 
that's activating just the motor and it
won't<00:05:18.040> turn<00:05:18.479> sometimes<00:05:19.479> you<00:05:19.600> can<00:05:19.720> hit<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.900> with

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
won't turn sometimes you can hit it with

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.460 
won't turn sometimes you can hit it with
a<00:05:20.140> hammer<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:21.570> get<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:22.690> to<00:05:22.780> turn<00:05:22.960> for<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.290> little

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
a hammer and get it to turn for a little

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.530 
a hammer and get it to turn for a little
bit<00:05:24.330> sometimes<00:05:25.330> that's<00:05:26.229> how<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:28.270> how<00:05:28.450> I

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
bit sometimes that's how that's how I

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.630 
bit sometimes that's how that's how I
was<00:05:28.720> lucky<00:05:28.990> enough<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.260> get<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.500> home<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:30.610> uh

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
was lucky enough to get it home but uh

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.850 
was lucky enough to get it home but uh
as<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:31.660> can<00:05:31.690> see<00:05:31.780> this<00:05:32.050> starter<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:32.560> kind<00:05:32.770> of

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
as you can see this starter is kind of

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.550 
as you can see this starter is kind of
kaput<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.960> I'll<00:05:34.960> show<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.169> what<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.350> new<00:05:35.440> one

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
kaput and I'll show you what the new one

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.890 
kaput and I'll show you what the new one
looks<00:05:35.680> like<00:05:35.800> -<00:05:36.010> here<00:05:36.850> we<00:05:36.970> go<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.419> new<00:05:37.570> starter

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
looks like - here we go the new starter
