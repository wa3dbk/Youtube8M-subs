like<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:47.469> now<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.249> deal<00:01:48.549> with<00:01:48.640> these<00:01:49.030> guys

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
like that now the deal with these guys

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.330 
like that now the deal with these guys
is<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.840> they<00:01:49.899> start<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.560> enrage<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.159> more

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
is that they start to enrage the more

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.550 
is that they start to enrage the more
you<00:01:51.460> attack<00:01:51.759> them<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.630> essentially<00:01:53.079> what

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
you attack them so essentially what

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.340 
you attack them so essentially what
maybe<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.700> you're<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.240> perhaps<00:01:55.689> not<00:01:56.109> at<00:01:56.259> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
maybe if you're you perhaps not at the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.499 
maybe if you're you perhaps not at the
gear<00:01:56.530> level<00:01:56.859> where<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.759> can<00:01:57.939> just<00:01:57.969> nuke<00:01:58.329> this

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
gear level where you can just nuke this

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.899 
gear level where you can just nuke this
down<00:01:58.810> completely<00:01:59.500> then<00:02:00.250> what<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.520> want<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.789> do

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
down completely then what you want to do

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.029 
down completely then what you want to do
is<00:02:01.119> perhaps<00:02:01.359> attack<00:02:01.780> them<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.109> about<00:02:02.349> 7<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.859> 10

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
is perhaps attack them to about 7 to 10

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.370 
is perhaps attack them to about 7 to 10
stacks<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.700> maybe<00:02:04.509> just<00:02:04.689> seven<00:02:04.959> or<00:02:05.049> eight<00:02:05.170> and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
stacks and maybe just seven or eight and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.319 
stacks and maybe just seven or eight and
then<00:02:05.709> once<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.459> of<00:02:06.579> them<00:02:06.670> hits<00:02:06.909> seven<00:02:07.270> or

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
then once one of them hits seven or

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.580 
then once one of them hits seven or
eight<00:02:07.390> slacks<00:02:07.689> switch<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.289> other<00:02:08.379> one

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
eight slacks switch to the other one

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.289 
eight slacks switch to the other one
essentially<00:02:09.340> as<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.610> attack<00:02:09.879> these<00:02:10.060> guys

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
essentially as you attack these guys

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.030 
essentially as you attack these guys
they<00:02:10.539> gain<00:02:10.690> stacks<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.290> damaged<00:02:11.590> increasing

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
they gain stacks of a damaged increasing

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.979 
they gain stacks of a damaged increasing
buff<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.489> then<00:02:12.970> when<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.180> switch<00:02:13.450> off<00:02:13.690> then

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
buff and then when you switch off then

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.170 
buff and then when you switch off then
the<00:02:14.110> buff<00:02:14.260> falls<00:02:14.590> off<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.579> minimizes

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the buff falls off and it just minimizes

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.210 
the buff falls off and it just minimizes
the<00:02:16.269> damage<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.870> now<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.410> didn't<00:02:17.890> find<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the damage on you now I didn't find the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.449 
the damage on you now I didn't find the
damage<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.549> be<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.879> problem<00:02:19.209> at<00:02:19.480> all<00:02:19.599> however

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
damage to be a problem at all however

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.410 
damage to be a problem at all however
it's<00:02:21.459> worth<00:02:21.549> knowing<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.000> I'm<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.180> packed

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
it's worth knowing that I'm a packed

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.479 
it's worth knowing that I'm a packed
class<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.930> there<00:02:23.379> are<00:02:23.470> some<00:02:23.620> kind<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.099> some

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
class and there are some kind of a some

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.460 
class and there are some kind of a some
kinds<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.879> a<00:02:24.940> oies<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.390> do<00:02:25.540> not<00:02:25.690> affect<00:02:25.900> pets

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
kinds of a oies that do not affect pets

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.020 
kinds of a oies that do not affect pets
because<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.310> game<00:02:27.430> would<00:02:27.579> be<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.819> bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
because the game would be a little bit

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.539 
because the game would be a little bit
ridiculous<00:02:28.299> if<00:02:28.750> they<00:02:28.900> did<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.829> that's<00:02:30.310> why<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
ridiculous if they did so that's why the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.920 
ridiculous if they did so that's why the
fight<00:02:30.760> would<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.030> been<00:02:31.120> easier<00:02:31.450> for<00:02:31.660> me<00:02:31.780> if

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
fight would have been easier for me if

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.800 
fight would have been easier for me if
you<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> male<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> classy<00:02:33.940> perhaps<00:02:34.629> you'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
you are a male a classy perhaps you'll

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.420 
you are a male a classy perhaps you'll
need<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.079> worry<00:02:35.260> about<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.160> you'll<00:02:36.310> need

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
need to worry about this so you'll need

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.190 
need to worry about this so you'll need
to<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.700> switching<00:02:37.180> them<00:02:37.329> up<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.810> switching

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
to be switching them up like switching

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.720 
to be switching them up like switching
their<00:02:38.319> stacks<00:02:38.620> using<00:02:39.010> cell<00:02:39.190> fields<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:39.640> that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
their stacks using cell fields and that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.550 
their stacks using cell fields and that
kind<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.000> thing<00:02:40.090> still<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.500> think

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
kind of thing still it's I don't think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.000 
kind of thing still it's I don't think
it's<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.890> very<00:02:42.010> hard<00:02:42.340> boss

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.220 

now<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> next<00:02:51.209> boss<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.689> probably<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
now the next boss is probably the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.020 
now the next boss is probably the
easiest<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.709> here<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.129> terms<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.519> its<00:02:53.730> quick

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
easiest one here in terms of its quick

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.940 
easiest one here in terms of its quick
it's<00:02:54.060> easy<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.930> probably<00:02:55.170> won't<00:02:55.560> kill<00:02:55.829> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it's easy and it probably won't kill you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.009 
it's easy and it probably won't kill you
it's<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.370> pandaren<00:02:57.030> woman<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
it's just this pandaren woman and

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.470 
it's just this pandaren woman and
essentially<00:02:58.560> she<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.579> put<00:02:59.970> some<00:03:00.150> crap<00:03:00.329> on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
essentially she will put some crap on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.789 
essentially she will put some crap on
the<00:03:00.540> floor<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.900> don't<00:03:01.049> want<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> stand<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.620> it

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
the floor you don't want to stand in it

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.380 
the floor you don't want to stand in it
then<00:03:01.920> she'll<00:03:02.129> turn<00:03:02.250> into<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> dragon<00:03:02.730> who<00:03:03.150> puts

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
then she'll turn into a dragon who puts

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.520 
then she'll turn into a dragon who puts
more<00:03:03.540> crap<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> floor<00:03:04.049> which<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.439> don't

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
more crap on the floor which you don't

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
more crap on the floor which you don't
want<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.799> stand<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.819> pretty<00:03:06.209> much<00:03:06.420> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
want to stand in that's pretty much it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.460 
want to stand in that's pretty much it
it's<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.049> really<00:03:07.319> damn<00:03:07.590> easy<00:03:07.860> fight

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:41.800 

Oh

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.750 

so<00:03:42.440> finally<00:03:42.739> we<00:03:42.830> have<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:42.980> shy<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.400> doubt<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
so finally we have the shy of doubt and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.830 
so finally we have the shy of doubt and
this<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.030> definitely<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.420> hardest<00:03:44.540> fight

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
this is definitely the hardest fight

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.449 
this is definitely the hardest fight
here<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.380> hardest<00:03:45.770> to<00:03:45.980> row<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.280> one

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
here and it's the hardest to row it one

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.970 
here and it's the hardest to row it one
that<00:03:46.580> I've<00:03:46.670> done<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.209> far<00:03:47.620> in<00:03:48.620> terms<00:03:48.770> of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
that I've done so far in terms of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.650 
that I've done so far in terms of
soloing<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.520> only<00:03:50.030> reason<00:03:50.239> for<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.480> is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
soloing the only reason for this is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.300 
soloing the only reason for this is
because<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:51.020> start<00:03:51.260> taking<00:03:51.620> ticks<00:03:51.890> off<00:03:52.130> i

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
because you start taking ticks off i

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.920 
because you start taking ticks off i
think<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.610> about<00:03:52.670> 50k<00:03:53.270> damage<00:03:53.630> every<00:03:53.810> two

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
think it's about 50k damage every two

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.199 
think it's about 50k damage every two
seconds<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.560> then<00:03:54.950> 30k<00:03:55.520> damage<00:03:55.849> every<00:03:56.060> two

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
seconds and then 30k damage every two

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.910 
seconds and then 30k damage every two
seconds<00:03:56.569> from<00:03:56.660> two<00:03:56.810> separate<00:03:57.140> sources<00:03:57.440> so

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
seconds from two separate sources so

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.620 
seconds from two separate sources so
that's<00:03:58.069> quite<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.280> lot<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.550> damage<00:03:58.730> I'm<00:03:59.180> as<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that's quite a lot of damage I'm as a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.750 
that's quite a lot of damage I'm as a
hunter<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.110> found<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.650> hard<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.040> survive<00:04:01.310> near

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
hunter I found it hard to survive near

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.190 
hunter I found it hard to survive near

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.690 
my core hound and then I used ancient
story<00:04:21.290> in<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:21.889> would<00:04:22.130> go<00:04:22.220> into<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.520> fight

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
story in it so I would go into the fight

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.850 
story in it so I would go into the fight
with<00:04:22.880> heroism<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:23.510> about<00:04:23.630> 30<00:04:23.930> seconds<00:04:24.410> which

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
with heroism for about 30 seconds which

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.560 
with heroism for about 30 seconds which
was<00:04:25.100> great<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.760> actually<00:04:26.090> what<00:04:26.180> got<00:04:26.419> me

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
was great that is actually what got me

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.969 
was great that is actually what got me
to<00:04:26.600> kill<00:04:26.810> before<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.290> wasn't<00:04:27.560> making<00:04:27.950> the

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
to kill before that I wasn't making the

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.219 
to kill before that I wasn't making the
DPS<00:04:28.400> requirement<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:29.840> hunters

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
DPS requirement just because hunters

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.780 
DPS requirement just because hunters
don't<00:04:30.410> have<00:04:30.650> much<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.040> way<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.220> self<00:04:31.520> heels

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
don't have much in the way of self heels

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.300 
don't have much in the way of self heels
so<00:04:32.690> really<00:04:33.169> with<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.650> that's<00:04:33.919> that's<00:04:34.160> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
so really with that that's that's the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.650 
so really with that that's that's the
whole<00:04:34.430> thing<00:04:34.460> done<00:04:34.880> there's<00:04:35.330> no<00:04:35.479> actual

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
whole thing done there's no actual

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.750 
whole thing done there's no actual
mechanics<00:04:36.440> really<00:04:36.950> involved<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.520> fight

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
mechanics really involved in this fight

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.070 
mechanics really involved in this fight
every<00:04:38.000> once<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> while<00:04:38.419> he<00:04:38.570> will<00:04:38.600> phase<00:04:38.870> out

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
every once in a while he will phase out

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.690 
every once in a while he will phase out
and<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.260> have<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.470> kill<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> small<00:04:39.860> ad<00:04:40.190> really

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
and you have to kill a small ad really

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.400 
and you have to kill a small ad really
simple<00:04:40.910> but<00:04:41.540> anyway<00:04:41.870> that's<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.229> for<00:04:42.290> this

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
simple but anyway that's it for this

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.930 
simple but anyway that's it for this
