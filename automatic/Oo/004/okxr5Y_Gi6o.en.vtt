00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
around and shoot things was that your

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.109 
around and shoot things was that your
first<00:01:50.739> plan<00:01:51.130> when<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.550> were<00:01:51.670> working<00:01:51.819> on

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
first plan when you were working on

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.760 
first plan when you were working on
Arkham<00:01:52.450> Asylum<00:01:52.690> when<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> Batmobile<00:01:53.619> was

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
Arkham Asylum when the Batmobile was

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.249 
Arkham Asylum when the Batmobile was
just<00:01:53.979> sitting<00:01:54.369> there<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.599> Batmobile<00:01:56.020> I

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
just sitting there so the Batmobile I

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.169 
just sitting there so the Batmobile I
think<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.679> something<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.130> we've<00:01:57.970> always

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
think is something that we've always

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.600 
think is something that we've always
wanted<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.959> in<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.349> in<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.860> batman<00:02:00.190> game<00:02:00.369> but

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
wanted to do in the in a batman game but

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.900 
wanted to do in the in a batman game but
it's<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.229> technical<00:02:02.860> hurdle<00:02:03.399> too<00:02:03.610> far

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
it's just was a technical hurdle too far

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.080 
it's just was a technical hurdle too far
in<00:02:04.149> as<00:02:04.300> far<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.220> sort<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.310> horsepower<00:02:06.910> that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
in as far as the sort of horsepower that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.550 
in as far as the sort of horsepower that
we<00:02:07.179> had<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.450> play<00:02:07.630> with<00:02:07.869> with<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> advent<00:02:08.440> of

innovation<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.959> we've<00:02:23.110> introduced<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
innovation that we've introduced in the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.380 
innovation that we've introduced in the
game<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.190> underpins<00:02:24.640> every<00:02:25.120> decision

around how the game should play

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.050 
around how the game should play
we<00:02:28.020> should<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.250> entirety<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> Gotham

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
we should do so the entirety of Gotham

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.340 
we should do so the entirety of Gotham
City<00:02:30.300> has<00:02:30.450> been<00:02:30.480> built<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.200> drive

around if you were driving around Arkham
City<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.330> wouldn't<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.840> big<00:02:34.050> enough<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
City just wouldn't be big enough you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.840 
City just wouldn't be big enough you
need<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> bigger<00:02:34.860> playground<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.520> drive<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
car in so we we've made of world five

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.010 
car in so we we've made of world five
times<00:02:38.250> bigger<00:02:38.400> than<00:02:38.520> Arkham<00:02:38.850> City<00:02:39.030> we've<00:02:39.360> the

you've<00:02:41.670> seen<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:41.970> Arkham<00:02:42.240> City<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> car

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
you've seen in Arkham City so the car

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.690

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
can drive around those more easily we

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.540 
can drive around those more easily we
made<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> taller<00:02:45.390> city<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.140> we<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.500> utilize<00:02:47.100> the
