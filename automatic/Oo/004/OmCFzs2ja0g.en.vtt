00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.760 
he's really good um he is a 34 463 blue
and<00:04:28.120> three<00:04:28.270> coalesce<00:04:28.660> he's<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> legendary

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and three coalesce he's a legendary

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.220 
and three coalesce he's a legendary
wizard<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:31.270> tap<00:04:31.510> him<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.780> draw<00:04:31.960> three<00:04:32.200> cards

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
wizard you tap him to draw three cards

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.870 
wizard you tap him to draw three cards
so<00:04:32.650> that's<00:04:32.800> three<00:04:33.040> points<00:04:33.400> would<00:04:33.520> never<00:04:33.700> ate

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
so that's three points would never ate

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.470 
so that's three points would never ate
there<00:04:34.060> every<00:04:34.300> turn<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.990> then<00:04:36.480> something's

going<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.490> go<00:04:45.610> over<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:48.130> next<00:04:48.370> piece<00:04:48.730> is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
going to go over so the next piece is

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
going to go over so the next piece is
thought<00:04:49.600> reflection<00:04:50.110> it's<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.530> seven<00:04:51.160> drop

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080

enchantment it costs three blue and for
catalysts<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:54.880> if<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:55.990> would<00:04:56.110> draw<00:04:56.320> card

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
catalysts and if you would draw card

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.630 
catalysts and if you would draw card
drug<00:04:56.770> two<00:04:57.250> cards<00:04:57.580> instead<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.570> it's<00:04:59.290> a<00:04:59.920> more

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
drug two cards instead so it's a more

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.240 
drug two cards instead so it's a more

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.670 
I'm not going to go over all of them
just<00:05:23.590> because<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.750> would<00:05:25.930> be<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> 20<00:05:26.470> minute

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680
