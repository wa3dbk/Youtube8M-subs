00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
walk over this pressure plate the door
closes<00:00:18.660> back<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:19.050> behind<00:00:19.289> us<00:00:19.529> from<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.039> side

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
right there sticky piston facing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
right there sticky piston facing
downwards<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.680> redstone<00:00:37.680> block

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
downwards like that redstone block

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
downwards like that redstone block
attached<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.790> redstone<00:00:39.120> block<00:00:39.510> immediately

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
attached that redstone block immediately

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.170 
attached that redstone block immediately
goes<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> repeater<00:00:43.040> off<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> side<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
goes into a repeater off to the side so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
goes into a repeater off to the side so
like<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.200> wide<00:00:46.410> still<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
like that it's all one wide still and we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
like that it's all one wide still and we
place<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> redstone<00:00:48.000> torch<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:49.280> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
place a redstone torch right there then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.380 
place a redstone torch right there then
two<00:00:50.850> redstone<00:00:51.059> dust<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:54.140> comparator

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
two redstone dust there a comparator

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.220 
two redstone dust there a comparator
right<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.070> then<00:00:59.070> obviously<00:00:59.390> you're<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
right there and then obviously you're to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.189 
right there and then obviously you're to
droppers<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:03.210> facing<00:01:03.660> into<00:01:04.110> each

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
droppers right there be facing into each

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.719 
droppers right there be facing into each
other<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:05.150> with<00:01:06.150> any<00:01:06.510> item<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.729> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
other like that with any item in like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
other like that with any item in like
that<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.560> press<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.070> button

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that so then when we press this button

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
that so then when we press this button
right<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> door<00:01:14.580> should<00:01:15.000> stay<00:01:15.270> open<00:01:15.630> no

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
right here the door should stay open no

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800 
right here the door should stay open no
it<00:01:16.650> shouldn't<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> add<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it shouldn't because we need to add a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.850 
it shouldn't because we need to add a
redstone<00:01:19.170> torch<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.860> under<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
redstone torch right under there and

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
redstone torch right under there and
then<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> door<00:01:23.220> should<00:01:23.430> stay<00:01:23.700> open<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.299> like

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
then the door should stay open just like

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
then the door should stay open just like
that<00:01:24.830> then<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.580> side

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that then when we go to the other side

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.649 
that then when we go to the other side
add<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.659> pressure<00:01:27.990> plate<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.659> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
add a pressure plate right there and a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.219 
add a pressure plate right there and a
redstone<00:01:31.140> dust<00:01:31.409> under<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.840> we<00:01:33.840> should<00:01:34.200> be

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
redstone dust under that we should be

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
redstone dust under that we should be
able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.850> open<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> stays

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
able to see that if we open it it stays

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.789 
able to see that if we open it it stays
open<00:01:37.640> then<00:01:38.640> whenever<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:39.119> update<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.290> piston

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
open then whenever we update this piston

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
open then whenever we update this piston
right<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.759> form<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.509> redstone

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
right here in the form of a redstone

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
right here in the form of a redstone
update<00:01:42.990> through<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.130> redstone<00:01:44.430> dust<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
update through that redstone dust it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
update through that redstone dust it
works<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.049> fine<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.579> basically
