00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 hangman it means and clash of the village 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.670
 just to be is what you want 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 and now I'm going to show you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 how to have this famous group h 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.609
 because we can have it in normal times in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 the game without necessarily needing a 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.410
 fashion 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 So here there is just held it takes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 to have fashion but paul h we can see it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 any time for your very character 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.130
 if she is not very powerful she is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 still fun is beautiful 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 so let's go to find 7 am all 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.450
 first you have to go in life 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.840
 of loneliness the lonely life that is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.000
 just 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.730
 here we all know the life of loneliness 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.530
 the imperial city 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 so after you go into the life of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.539
 loneliness and you will find the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.879
 hangman of solitude so that's name is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.660
 much more complicated maps then the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 dja house there right there 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.070
 the jack house is right there so 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 that's where our friend is at 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.880
 late the executioner knows where he sleeps at night 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.939
 and the day he has to morneau fort 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 why he is so strong it is 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.970
 because the town are 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.439
 usually in prison they monitor 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.869
 go on we go and after so you go 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 here you have no other choice by 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.350
 against done does the quest that you 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.990
 a little head but do not worry 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
