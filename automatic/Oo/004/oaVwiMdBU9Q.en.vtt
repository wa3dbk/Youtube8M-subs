really<00:05:43.449> something<00:05:44.139> special<00:05:44.169> uh<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.610> on't<00:05:45.970> deal

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
really something special uh it on't deal

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.600 
really something special uh it on't deal
it's<00:05:46.570> only<00:05:46.840> competition<00:05:47.380> in<00:05:47.650> my<00:05:47.830> mind<00:05:48.099> is<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
it's only competition in my mind is the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.300 
it's only competition in my mind is the
the<00:05:49.090> olympics<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:49.810> maybe<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.229> world<00:05:50.440> cup<00:05:50.770> as

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
the olympics and maybe the world cup as

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.219 
the olympics and maybe the world cup as
an<00:05:51.550> American<00:05:52.030> I'm<00:05:52.180> a<00:05:52.270> fan<00:05:52.479> of<00:05:52.509> the<00:05:52.690> super<00:05:53.050> bowl

an American I'm a fan of the super bowl
but<00:05:53.590> somehow<00:05:54.340> i<00:05:54.490> think<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.909> tour<00:05:55.120> is<00:05:55.240> more

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
but somehow i think the tour is more

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.870

special
