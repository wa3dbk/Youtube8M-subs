00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
as a hard drive where it saves data the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.819 
as a hard drive where it saves data the
good<00:01:29.520> thing<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.090> ram<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.960> extremely<00:01:31.530> fast

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
good thing is that ram is extremely fast

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590 
good thing is that ram is extremely fast
and<00:01:32.310> hence<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> great

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and hence you will see a great

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.990 
and hence you will see a great
improvement<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.950> computer<00:01:35.430> performance

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
improvement in the computer performance

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.240 
improvement in the computer performance
given<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> data<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.259> request<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
given that the data you request is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.480 
given that the data you request is
actually<00:01:38.520> found<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.840> any<00:01:40.710> case<00:01:41.130> there

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
actually found there in any case there

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually found there in any case there
will<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.970> improvement<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.380> however

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
will be some improvement it will however

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.580 
will be some improvement it will however
vary<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:44.880> much<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:46.110> nice<00:01:46.290> thing<00:01:46.560> about

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
vary as to how much the nice thing about

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
vary as to how much the nice thing about
this<00:01:46.979> performance<00:01:47.520> booster<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this performance booster is that it is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.340 
this performance booster is that it is
free<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> interface<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.540> software<00:01:51.990> tool

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
free the interface of this software tool

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.100 
free the interface of this software tool
is<00:01:52.560> rather<00:01:52.770> simple<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.850> app<00:01:54.000> runs<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> small

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
is rather simple the app runs in a small

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.999 
is rather simple the app runs in a small
