00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and what they say here is this the basic

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.380 
and what they say here is this the basic
structure<00:04:26.980> of<00:04:27.160> Pokemon<00:04:27.880> games<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
structure of Pokemon games and the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.120 
structure of Pokemon games and the
elements<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.050> keep<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.350> series<00:04:29.770> together

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
elements that keep the series together

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.970 
elements that keep the series together
like<00:04:30.730> gyms<00:04:31.240> elite<00:04:31.750> foreign<00:04:32.200> champions<00:04:32.770> are

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
like gyms elite foreign champions are

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.740 
like gyms elite foreign champions are
not<00:04:33.160> going<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.550> change<00:04:33.790> so<00:04:34.420> if<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.630> are

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
not going to change so if you are

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.470 
not going to change so if you are
expecting<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.440> Pokemon<00:04:35.980> series<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.820> have<00:04:37.420> a

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
expecting the Pokemon series to have a

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.470 
expecting the Pokemon series to have a
major<00:04:37.870> change<00:04:38.380> in<00:04:38.620> its<00:04:38.770> gameplay<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.490> format

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
major change in its gameplay and format

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.810 
major change in its gameplay and format
don't<00:04:41.200> expect<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.920> because<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:42.430> pretty<00:04:42.640> much

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
don't expect it because they pretty much

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.180 
don't expect it because they pretty much
want<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> game<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.420> be<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.840> same<00:04:44.170> exact<00:04:44.740> thing

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190

Pokemon and even Call of Duty has

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.740 
Pokemon and even Call of Duty has
changed<00:04:58.870> more<00:04:59.080> recently<00:04:59.500> than<00:04:59.680> Pokemon<00:05:00.190> has

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
changed more recently than Pokemon has

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.850 
changed more recently than Pokemon has
because<00:05:01.750> especially<00:05:02.230> when<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.830> a

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
because especially when you have a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.650 
because especially when you have a
series<00:05:03.310> that's<00:05:03.490> long-running<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:04.510> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
series that's long-running you have to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.840 
series that's long-running you have to
change<00:05:04.930> stuff<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.410> keep<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.710> fresh<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.250> what

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
change stuff to keep it fresh and what

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.640 
change stuff to keep it fresh and what
are<00:05:06.940> they<00:05:07.120> doing<00:05:07.150> right<00:05:07.600> here<00:05:07.990> they're

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
are they doing right here they're

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.920 
are they doing right here they're
talking<00:05:09.010> about<00:05:09.490> how<00:05:09.850> they<00:05:10.420> want<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.720> basically

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
talking about how they want to basically

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.740 
talking about how they want to basically
keep<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.710> same<00:05:12.010> formula<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:12.940> same<00:05:13.180> but

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
keep the same formula the same but

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.930 
keep the same formula the same but
afterwards<00:05:14.230> they<00:05:14.440> say<00:05:14.650> this<00:05:14.830> we<00:05:15.550> still

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
afterwards they say this we still

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.760 
afterwards they say this we still
haven't<00:05:16.330> decided<00:05:16.420> which<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.350> newly

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
something that with Pokemon they

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.520 
something that with Pokemon they
basically<00:05:39.280> add<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:40.360> take<00:05:40.780> out<00:05:41.020> features

randomly you know what series that
reminds<00:05:43.540> me<00:05:43.660> of<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:44.110> sonic<00:05:44.590> franchise

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
reminds me of the sonic franchise

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.590 
reminds me of the sonic franchise
because<00:05:45.280> they<00:05:45.400> do<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.670> same<00:05:45.940> exact<00:05:46.360> thing

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
because they do the same exact thing

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.510 
because they do the same exact thing
with<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.840> sonic<00:05:47.200> franchise<00:05:47.320> they<00:05:48.310> add

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
with the sonic franchise they add

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.580 
with the sonic franchise they add
features<00:05:49.090> instead<00:05:49.540> of<00:05:49.660> polishing<00:05:50.320> them<00:05:50.440> up

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
features instead of polishing them up

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.710 
features instead of polishing them up
for<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:51.040> next<00:05:51.190> game<00:05:51.520> they<00:05:52.120> just<00:05:52.300> take<00:05:52.540> them

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
for the next game they just take them

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.650

notice how schizophrenic it feels from

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.820 
notice how schizophrenic it feels from
game<00:06:15.670> to<00:06:15.880> game<00:06:15.910> because<00:06:16.780> everything<00:06:17.380> seems<00:06:17.680> to

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
game to game because everything seems to

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.430 
game to game because everything seems to
change<00:06:18.280> and<00:06:18.760> not<00:06:19.570> in<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.780> good<00:06:19.930> way<00:06:19.990> either

because it's not like any of these new

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.600 
because it's not like any of these new
changes<00:06:22.870> are<00:06:22.960> polished<00:06:23.530> either<00:06:23.860> because<00:06:24.430> they

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
changes are polished either because they

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.320 
changes are polished either because they
just<00:06:24.760> add<00:06:24.970> and<00:06:25.240> remove<00:06:25.300> features<00:06:25.900> at<00:06:26.170> will<00:06:26.590> and
