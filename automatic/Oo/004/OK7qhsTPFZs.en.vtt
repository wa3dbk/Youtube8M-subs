 small fast manoeuvrable nh90's test flights at the helicopter 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.920
 Squadron 64 in Holzdorf 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.579
 here flies the new helicopter of the German armed forces nh 90 since 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.880
 This year helicopter squadron 64 in Holzdorf test flights 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.779
 The aim of the skills the book screwdriver carried it to heart and 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.640
 Kidney check Three machines are available in Holzdorf 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.720
 technically, the nh90 brings along some novelties and learn how to handle them 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.079
 Both pilots and technicians have a big challenge 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.400
 for both because the new systems and building prices make the nh90 unique 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 yes, one thing at this point is that somebody is staying there 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.650
 Previously known, he must conclude the so-called 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.900
 that means we also do not want a tax reform by the pilot 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.940
 over the strands or ropes was transmitted but that happens 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.830
 not alone 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.150
 over computer and during the cake pouring and electrical lines 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 Overall, the NH90 is more than 19 meters long and has a rotor diameter of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.800
 good 16 meters 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.330
 Without additional tanks, the crew can be up to four and a half hours in the air 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.120
 stay and travel up to 800 kilometers 20 soldiers or twelve 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.380
 the helicopter can carry it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.689
 Aviatorically, the new helicopter has only one motto Kleinert faster if 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.460
 the gave that finds especially in the pilots great popularity already more than 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.509
 100 flying hours have been completed with the nh90 in Holzdorf for them 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.509
 something very special 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
 about 30 years earlier eggs is consumed 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.720
 Fri. 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.430
 she drives 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.430
 this is a question 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.179
 it is much more difficult 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.899
 even if the soldiers have been waiting for this quantum leap for a long time » 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.899
 It now means looking ahead », says the commander 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.519
 which one clearly notices it 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.379
 that people can finally touch 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.179
 have learned over the years 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.219
 and you can see with what motivation you can fight for the machine in 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.599
 to bring the air I can do it I can what I have what I have 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.339
 I have learned to implement 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.589
 and I do not blame anyone so fast that's him 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.419
 pleasant to watch and that makes me as a club leader very proud 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.739
 in the next few years, the nh90 should have the transport helicopter of the EU 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.970
 once the peeling off 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.350
 until the time has come the pilots in Holzdorf but still have some test flights
