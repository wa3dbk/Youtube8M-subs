00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello today I'm going to show you the various 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:15.150
 types of automatic pedals there 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:18.040
 both on the road and in the mountains 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.320
 emphasize that it is one of the components 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.530
 most valued by cyclists since 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.190
 thanks to it we can exert force 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.460
 both when we force down 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.110
 with the foot like when we raise the foot 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
 it means that pedaling is more 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 round frame more constant and there's 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.160
 no deadlock to start you 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.660
 I will teach the two models that we have 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.530
 brought today from road that one is the one of 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.280
 the loop brand 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.280
 co2 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.670
 is the most common among the pedals of 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.550
 highway 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.480
 as you can see the pedal 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.480
 in triangular shape 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.649
 in the face 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.649
 Mrs 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.590
 has implants of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.320
 rubber so it does not slip moss 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 and you have the rubber implants 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.720
 there are them without the rubber there are like this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 that are 4 degrees and a half that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.050
 say that we can move the shoe in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.280
 the pedal 4 degrees and a half there are 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.610
 they are 0 degrees 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 is fixed and there are those that are red 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.080
 that are 9 degrees for people who 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 starts 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 the other more minimalist model is the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 mark street plane vale is what they use 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 very many professionals because very 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.800
 simple but very little is so 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.930
 minimalist than thinking a little 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.900
 what improvements have to 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.470
 of the loop that this pedal can pull 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.330
 with both sides both for this one and 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.330
 for this one instead the look 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.349
 openwork 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.239
 a small disadvantage that these have 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.990
 pedals are the faces that are a little bit 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.260
 heavier 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.930
 than the previous model that comes 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.880
 plates that is the whole of the cove 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.080
 besides putting it is explained in it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.390
 of pedal instructions 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.380
 then we have the worst automatic 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 of shimano that are very similar 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.050
 to the light, as you can see, the platform 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.410
 of the pedal is also triangular to see is 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.290
 round and also one-sided 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.750
 just for this one 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.500
 to face 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.040
 and the cove is very light but a tad 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.420
 bigger here 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.800
 these rubber points 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.800
 they will make us better 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.660
 this is from ne in terms of road in 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.270
 As for mountain we have brought you two 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.420
 models that are the best sellers in 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.770
 our challenge page worth one is the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.830
 standard-bearer of shimano that is not that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.040
 be the best is not the high end but 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.220
 The second range that price quality is 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.170
 unsurpassed are the xt models of 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.800
 shimano is worth this pedal cala for the two 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.010
 faces so much for this one as annoying and it 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.510
 remove by pulling the foot out towards 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.880
 inside you can 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.490
 and get out of the two ways 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.550
 the coves much smaller than those of 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.690
 road as you see here is a triangle 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.690
 very tiny 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.630
 and is the most used 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.740
 after the cam brothers brand we have 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.530
 the peter vale are very light 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.940
 and the advantage of these pedals is that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.730
 you can anchor by the four sides has 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.840
 the four faces and the cove is also 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.430
 very small when they put it you put it on 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.970
 the view and it's very minimalist almost 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.610
 you only see one and recited it out 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.039
 and you can not see anything else 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.020
 Take away the fear of being told 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.879
 that with the automatic pedras you fall 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.449
 is getting used 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.979
 once you get used to it, you will see that 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.060
 would change for nothing we carry what 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.389
 I recommend that the problems 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.389
 everyone 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.389
 and
