00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.400
 the group a 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.660
 magna 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 there is nothing nothing 9 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.400
 now the office programs of specific attention and north 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 we already have them available for the iphone although we already have them for the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.539
 ipad the application is universal, so we do not have to buy them again 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.550
 simply if we start with the iphone 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 in this video we will see in Antwerp the spreadsheet in which we can 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.659
 create and manage 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.380
 all of us in order to calculate all our books with 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.210
 different strata that we want to process quite easily we are going to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.470
 see how we can make proposals 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 of these documents that we can create concretely copy wishes and quimsa and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.329
 a man or a Serbian 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.220
 also if we throw a minor or commented we're going to have like we already had 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.000
 in the Basque country also in the pro-am for mac different templates that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.450
 use it and so we a simple summer theme these documents 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.120
 and as you can see from the iphone we are going to have available the options that 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.850
 we already had in the hall pass 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 we will go 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.430
 loading any document in our case we will introduce 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.970
 a test we are going to also now produce a number an amount 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 this spreadsheet as selected for the example 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.530
 at all times as clear vicente is transformed if we want to rent 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 intrusion a formula other we want to introduce a value will allow us 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 do it without any problem 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 and if now for example we already have a list of values ​​we want to produce 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.010
 one month a sum for example to make us 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.230
 a quick calculation we have to look at the same sentence that we already know from 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.170
 yesterday computer or also from the ipad i 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.800
 it will automatically return the result 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.300
 We are not going to be able to work horizontally, it is one of the problems 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.000
 we can give the application but otherwise it is a complete application of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.260
 office automation that will allow us to manage all our data with 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.700
 comfort 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.350
 As you can see we can adjust all the values ​​that we introduce for example in a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.900
 list a graph a table 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 we can also introduce figures with a photograph 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.000
 we have the whole gallery available 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.869
 that we already knew anew about the cemeteries programs in martí in the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.069
 act 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.790
 we will include for example a graph we hold that choose the model 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.980
 use twice in the graph to select a range of data 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.549
 on which the graphic is going to be made 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.619
 we just have to choose what the 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.969
 of the table that we have created 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.979
 if we are in the range we already had created it on the side if we want to modify 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.529
 any detail we have to double-click twice again 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.190
 and as you can see simply with your finger 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.549
 we can adapt its size move it around the sheet pz 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.839
 we are going to put 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 at the end of the table 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.229
 As you can see it is very simple simply with your finger we will see it 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.969
 adapting 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.969
 to our interest 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.539
 if we press the tools button we can share that print as 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.769
 that pushkin ended up inside the table this is very useful if for example we have 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 a table with many records 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.709
 in the share print section we can send by post 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.249
 print to a printer 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.449
 that we have shared output of pinto 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.549
 ok directly send to itunes I will share bórquez eta 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 and in adjustments we have own adjustments of the page itself 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.349
 so as you see namber is an essential office automation tool 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.479
 all there is sun especially if we use the phone put to work or for in 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 the university perform different studies other low 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.499
 also of course we will be able to establish a format to do it 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.149
 simply touching the masters modify from here the appearance of the table 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.209
 the design the header 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.769
 we're going to have 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.870
 also all that are the choices of ee cell color stuffing and so on for 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.099
 leave the table also showed our taste is and share it follow 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.459
 working for example on the computer when we get home without having to 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.519
 create or do 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.870
 yes once we have finished editing we return to what is the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.870
 joy of spreadsheets we will be able to press the edit button 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.430
 duplicate a sheet to work with a security coupe or directly because 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.650
 you delete the pronaa coast 7 29 and remember that if we already have the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 application for ipad we do not have colo and here is why this application is 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.549
 has become the universal 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.460
