horse calm and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.319> pelvic<00:00:05.069> area<00:00:06.230> it's<00:00:07.230> called<00:00:07.470> the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
about the pelvic area it's called the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.299 
about the pelvic area it's called the
sacral<00:00:08.040> area<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:10.380> hips<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:11.010> start

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
sacral area and the hips really start

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.249 
sacral area and the hips really start
here<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.910> then<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.420> pelvis<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
here and then you have the pelvis and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.939 
here and then you have the pelvis and
you<00:00:14.160> notice<00:00:14.519> how<00:00:14.670> high<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:16.640> there<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
you notice how high up this is there is

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.290 
you notice how high up this is there is
people<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.160> say<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.970> hotter

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
people would say that this is a hotter

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
people would say that this is a hotter
spot<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.080> there's<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.529> hardly<00:00:22.949> any<00:00:23.100> dip

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
spot but there's really hardly any dip

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.200 
spot but there's really hardly any dip
in<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.099> flat<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.580> mean<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
in here so it's a little flat I mean you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.029 
in here so it's a little flat I mean you
could<00:00:27.420> try<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> hunters<00:00:28.529> pump<00:00:28.740> but

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
could try and do the hunters pump but

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.810 
could try and do the hunters pump but
when<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.599> high<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
when this is up really high like it is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.020 
when this is up really high like it is
what<00:00:32.820> happens<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.950> there's<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.309> plates<00:00:35.700> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
what happens is is there's two plates in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.889 
what happens is is there's two plates in
there<00:00:36.710> basically<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.390> from<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> from

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
there basically and when from the from

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
there basically and when from the from
time<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:40.379> were<00:00:40.440> born<00:00:40.770> until<00:00:41.160> ten<00:00:41.430> years<00:00:41.460> old

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
time they were born until ten years old

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
time they were born until ten years old
this<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:43.230> fuse<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:46.070> sacral<00:00:47.070> area

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this will fuse into the sacral area

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.209 
this will fuse into the sacral area
pelvis<00:00:47.969> area<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> fuse<00:00:49.289> together<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> age

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
pelvis area and fuse together by the age

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
pelvis area and fuse together by the age
of<00:00:50.430> ten<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.440> happens<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.539> sometimes<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
of ten and what happens is sometimes a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.490 
of ten and what happens is sometimes a
jumper<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.610> jump<00:00:56.969> offense<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.899> they

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
jumper or if they jump offense and they

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
jumper or if they jump offense and they
get<00:00:58.739> hung<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.340> they<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.510> separate<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.670> sacral

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
get hung up they can separate the sacral

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.440 
get hung up they can separate the sacral
area<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> pelvic<00:01:07.500> region<00:01:08.210> from<00:01:09.210> when

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
area of this the pelvic region from when

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.840 
area of this the pelvic region from when
it<00:01:09.570> fused<00:01:09.900> together<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.710> separate<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it fused together it can separate and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
it fused together it can separate and
this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> separation<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
this is a separation when you see this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.590 
this is a separation when you see this
really<00:01:14.460> profound<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.110> separation

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
really profound it's a separation

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
really profound it's a separation
unfortunately<00:01:18.600> once<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.229> separated<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
unfortunately once it's separated and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.999 
unfortunately once it's separated and
never<00:01:20.189> goes<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.930> okay<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> never<00:01:22.500> goes<00:01:22.710> back

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
never goes back okay it never goes back

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.240 
never goes back okay it never goes back
now<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.509> destroy<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> horse<00:01:25.470> no

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
now do you have to destroy the horse no

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.670 
now do you have to destroy the horse no
the<00:01:26.759> horse<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.420> learn<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.229> walk<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.979> its<00:01:29.850> own

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
the horse can learn to walk on its own

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
the horse can learn to walk on its own
and<00:01:31.680> he<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.130> only<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.579> safe<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and he would only be safe for like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
and he would only be safe for like
walking<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> were<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> ride<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> I
