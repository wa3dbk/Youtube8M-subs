because<00:01:55.410> frankly<00:01:56.090> they're<00:01:57.090> rubbish<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:58.530> we've

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
because frankly they're rubbish so we've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.190 
because frankly they're rubbish so we've
gone<00:01:59.519> for<00:01:59.729> an<00:01:59.819> upgrade<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.690> all<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.989> bits

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
gone for an upgrade and it's all in bits

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.320 
gone for an upgrade and it's all in bits
so<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> bit<00:02:01.769> of<00:02:01.860> unpacking<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.030> we'll<00:02:03.179> put

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
so a bit of unpacking and then we'll put

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:12.059 
so a bit of unpacking and then we'll put
it<00:02:03.420> together

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.449 

no<00:02:12.819> instructions<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> good<00:02:14.859> thing<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.249> I

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
no instructions but the good thing is I

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.699 
no instructions but the good thing is I
have<00:02:15.700> got<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.060> old<00:02:16.269> one<00:02:16.719> to<00:02:17.019> copy<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
have got the old one to copy and

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.619 
have got the old one to copy and
actually<00:02:18.040> taking<00:02:18.249> it<00:02:18.459> apart<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.150> quite<00:02:19.389> fun

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
actually taking it apart it's quite fun

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.119 
actually taking it apart it's quite fun
in<00:02:19.749> its<00:02:19.900> own<00:02:20.049> right<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.739> suddenly

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
in its own right because you suddenly

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.580 
in its own right because you suddenly
see<00:02:21.519> how<00:02:21.939> horrible<00:02:22.749> it<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.260> here

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
see how horrible it all is in here

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.979 
see how horrible it all is in here
essentially<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.519> very<00:02:24.730> simple<00:02:25.180> box<00:02:25.629> this

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
essentially it's very simple box this

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.979 
essentially it's very simple box this
with<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> big<00:02:26.829> hole<00:02:27.159> in<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.909> end<00:02:28.209> which<00:02:28.540> air<00:02:28.780> is

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
with a big hole in this end which air is

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.470 
with a big hole in this end which air is
drawn<00:02:29.409> through<00:02:29.799> from<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> outside<00:02:30.519> by<00:02:31.030> this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
drawn through from the outside by this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.740 
drawn through from the outside by this
fan<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.469> air<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:33.010> passes<00:02:33.189> through<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:34.389> bit

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
fan the air then passes through this bit

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.899 
fan the air then passes through this bit
which<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.079> a<00:02:35.170> heater<00:02:35.439> matrix<00:02:36.010> which<00:02:36.340> has<00:02:36.609> hot

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
which is a heater matrix which has hot

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.759 
which is a heater matrix which has hot
water<00:02:37.150> from<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> engine<00:02:37.629> flowing<00:02:38.439> through<00:02:38.680> it

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
water from the engine flowing through it

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.979 
water from the engine flowing through it
it's<00:02:38.889> like<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> mini<00:02:39.340> little<00:02:39.430> radiator<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
it's like a mini little radiator now the

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.629 
it's like a mini little radiator now the
important<00:02:41.560> thing<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.519> you

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
important thing with this is that you

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.699 
important thing with this is that you
can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:42.909> that<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.239> some<00:02:43.959> very<00:02:44.169> decayed

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
can see that there is some very decayed

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.089 
can see that there is some very decayed
horrible<00:02:45.519> old<00:02:45.639> foam<00:02:46.090> around<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.590> matrix

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
horrible old foam around this matrix

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.920 
horrible old foam around this matrix
here<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.489> that's<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.849> try<00:02:48.969> and<00:02:49.120> seal<00:02:49.419> it<00:02:49.599> into

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
here and that's to try and seal it into

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.030 
here and that's to try and seal it into
the<00:02:50.019> box<00:02:50.199> because<00:02:50.349> obviously<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.769> air<00:02:50.859> goes

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the box because obviously the air goes

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.000 
the box because obviously the air goes
around<00:02:51.219> the<00:02:51.400> outside<00:02:51.909> of<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:53.319> matrix<00:02:53.799> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
around the outside of the matrix it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.709 
around the outside of the matrix it
completely<00:02:54.430> short-circuits<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.209> system<00:02:55.599> and

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
completely short-circuits the system and

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.539 
completely short-circuits the system and
doesn't<00:02:55.870> pick<00:02:56.079> up<00:02:56.199> any<00:02:56.379> heat<00:02:56.949> from<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.519> water

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
doesn't pick up any heat from the water

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.170 
doesn't pick up any heat from the water
so<00:02:58.359> pretty<00:02:58.780> horrible<00:02:59.199> you<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.919> to<00:03:00.069> admit<00:03:00.340> but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so pretty horrible you have to admit but

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.240 
so pretty horrible you have to admit but
it's<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.419> good<00:03:01.629> map<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.199> you<00:03:02.319> like<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.829> rebuild

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
it's a good map if you like to rebuild

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.280 
it's a good map if you like to rebuild
it<00:03:03.370> with<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.609> parts<00:03:03.939> we've<00:03:04.120> now<00:03:04.329> got<00:03:04.599> here<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
it with the parts we've now got here the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.199 
it with the parts we've now got here the
two<00:03:05.530> big<00:03:05.859> things<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.340> are<00:03:06.430> upgraded<00:03:07.060> are

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
two big things that are upgraded are

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.929 
two big things that are upgraded are
first<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.049> fan<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.919> you<00:03:09.579> can<00:03:09.699> see<00:03:09.909> just

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
first the fan and you can see just

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.869 
first the fan and you can see just
physically<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:11.199> is<00:03:11.829> bigger<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.609> going<00:03:12.819> to

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
physically it is bigger so it's going to

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.959 
physically it is bigger so it's going to
move<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.389> air<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.439> secondly<00:03:14.949> is<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.549> matrix

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 
move more air but secondly is the matrix

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.179 
move more air but secondly is the matrix
itself<00:03:16.569> this<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> new<00:03:17.199> matrix<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:18.009> if<00:03:18.069> I

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
itself this is the new matrix and if I

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.249 
itself this is the new matrix and if I
just<00:03:18.220> rotate<00:03:18.759> it<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.139> edge

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:20.259 
just rotate it you can see on the edge

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.839 
just rotate it you can see on the edge
there<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.769> can<00:03:20.859> see<00:03:20.979> those<00:03:21.129> bars<00:03:21.400> running

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
there if you can see those bars running

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.199 
there if you can see those bars running
through<00:03:22.209> there<00:03:22.419> are<00:03:22.509> eight<00:03:22.689> cores<00:03:23.169> in<00:03:23.590> there

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
through there are eight cores in there

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.710 
through there are eight cores in there
compare<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.449> to<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:27.069> old<00:03:27.099> one<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:28.329> can<00:03:28.509> see

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
compare that to the old one you can see

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.379 
compare that to the old one you can see
there's<00:03:29.199> only<00:03:29.379> five<00:03:29.769> cores<00:03:30.129> in<00:03:30.370> there<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:30.970> an

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
there's only five cores in there so an

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.979 
there's only five cores in there so an
upgraded<00:03:32.519> matrix<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:34.090> an<00:03:34.180> upgraded<00:03:34.569> fan

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
upgraded matrix and an upgraded fan

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.929 
upgraded matrix and an upgraded fan
should<00:03:35.530> solve<00:03:35.979> the<00:03:36.189> problem<00:03:36.549> but<00:03:36.669> it's<00:03:36.790> how

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
should solve the problem but it's how

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.879 
should solve the problem but it's how

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
we have a slight problem here this is a

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.379 
we have a slight problem here this is a
good<00:04:20.709> reason<00:04:21.009> why<00:04:21.340> when<00:04:21.819> you<00:04:21.909> build<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:22.330> of

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
good reason why when you build one of

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.850 
good reason why when you build one of
these<00:04:22.509> you<00:04:22.840> do<00:04:22.990> need<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.259> test<00:04:23.469> it<00:04:23.590> before<00:04:23.710> you

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
these you do need to test it before you

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.520 
these you do need to test it before you
put<00:04:24.099> it<00:04:24.189> in<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.340> car<00:04:24.580> because<00:04:28.020> that's<00:04:29.020> not<00:04:29.469> a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
put it in the car because that's not a

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.010 
put it in the car because that's not a
good<00:04:29.710> sound<00:04:29.919> isn't<00:04:30.219> it<00:04:30.629> and<00:04:31.629> what's<00:04:31.840> actually

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
good sound isn't it and what's actually

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.879 
good sound isn't it and what's actually
a<00:04:32.229> diesel<00:04:32.819> exactly<00:04:33.819> a<00:04:34.199> two-stroke<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.650> fans

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
a diesel exactly a two-stroke the fans

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.529 
a diesel exactly a two-stroke the fans
hitting<00:04:36.340> one<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> baffles<00:04:37.000> in<00:04:37.180> here<00:04:37.330> very

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
hitting one of the baffles in here very

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.379 
hitting one of the baffles in here very
slightly<00:04:38.139> what<00:04:38.289> it's<00:04:38.439> done<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.740> hook<00:04:39.009> off<00:04:39.389> one

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
slightly what it's done is hook off one

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.270 
slightly what it's done is hook off one
of<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.599> balance<00:04:40.930> weights<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:42.009> can<00:04:42.129> see

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
of the balance weights that you can see

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.860 
of the balance weights that you can see
is<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.430> little<00:04:42.550> silver<00:04:43.030> weight<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.569> on<00:04:43.719> the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
is a little silver weight that's on the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.170 
is a little silver weight that's on the
fan<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.830> that's<00:04:45.219> in<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:45.610> somewhere<00:04:45.909> we're

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
fan so that's in there somewhere we're

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.520 
fan so that's in there somewhere we're
going<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.360> take<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.629> lid<00:04:46.810> back<00:04:46.990> off

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
going to take the lid back off

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.040 
going to take the lid back off
find<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.250> balance<00:04:48.400> weight<00:04:48.759> reinstate<00:04:49.539> it<00:04:49.750> and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
find the balance weight reinstate it and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.559 
find the balance weight reinstate it and
then<00:04:50.919> make<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> minor<00:04:51.849> adjustment<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.449> the

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
then make a minor adjustment to the

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.589 
then make a minor adjustment to the
baffle<00:04:52.960> which<00:04:53.259> will<00:04:53.409> involve<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.860> use<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.599> very

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
baffle which will involve the use a very

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:05.040 
baffle which will involve the use a very
small<00:04:55.659> hammer<00:04:58.529> there's<00:04:59.529> that<00:04:59.860> that<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.810> fan

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
small hammer there's that that the fan

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.920 
small hammer there's that that the fan
itself<00:05:05.469> is<00:05:06.189> fouling<00:05:06.699> on<00:05:06.819> the<00:05:06.939> baffle<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.509> here

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
itself is fouling on the baffle in here

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.689 
itself is fouling on the baffle in here
if<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.319> look<00:05:08.439> at<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.650> from<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.919> back<00:05:09.099> the

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
if you look at it from the back the

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.700 
if you look at it from the back the
whole<00:05:09.729> fan<00:05:10.240> looks<00:05:10.779> as<00:05:10.960> if<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.229> too<00:05:11.409> far<00:05:11.680> that

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
whole fan looks as if it's too far that

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.800 
whole fan looks as if it's too far that

one<00:05:56.910> what's<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.780> bracket<00:05:58.110> like<00:05:58.230> for<00:05:58.440> the

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
one what's the bracket like for the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.470 
one what's the bracket like for the
cable<00:05:58.860> like<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.580> what's<00:06:00.090> that<00:06:00.150> you're<00:06:00.360> on

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
cable like that what's that you're on

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.780 
cable like that what's that you're on
your<00:06:00.600> hand<00:06:00.780> that's<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.830> big<00:06:01.980> foam<00:06:02.220> that's<00:06:02.520> not

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
your hand that's a big foam that's not

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.860 
your hand that's a big foam that's not
on<00:06:02.880> though<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.120> it<00:06:03.360> yeah<00:06:03.950> so<00:06:04.950> that<00:06:05.660> must<00:06:06.660> be<00:06:06.720> a

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
on though is it yeah so that must be a

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.890 
on though is it yeah so that must be a
seal<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.860> inside<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.190> there<00:06:08.490> well<00:06:08.900> inside

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
seal on the inside of there well inside

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.510 
seal on the inside of there well inside
between<00:06:10.170> the<00:06:10.500> heat<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.830> between<00:06:11.130> that<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:11.340> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
between the heat a between that and the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.080 
between the heat a between that and the
bolt<00:06:11.760> is<00:06:12.050> right<00:06:13.050> okay<00:06:13.640> well<00:06:14.640> we<00:06:14.760> haven't<00:06:14.940> got

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
bolt is right okay well we haven't got

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.990 
bolt is right okay well we haven't got
one<00:06:15.210> of<00:06:15.300> these<00:06:16.220> so<00:06:17.220> that's<00:06:17.400> not<00:06:17.580> in<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:17.820> kit

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
one of these so that's not in the kit

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.670 
one of these so that's not in the kit
which<00:06:18.630> means<00:06:18.870> should<00:06:19.140> it<00:06:19.260> be<00:06:19.320> in<00:06:19.350> the<00:06:19.500> gate

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
which means should it be in the gate

it<00:06:21.630> should<00:06:21.780> be<00:06:21.960> cuz<00:06:22.230> I<00:06:22.320> said<00:06:22.470> it<00:06:22.620> should<00:06:22.800> have

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
it should be cuz I said it should have

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.230 
it should be cuz I said it should have
all<00:06:23.040> the<00:06:23.070> gaskets<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.580> everything<00:06:23.820> well<00:06:23.970> I

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
all the gaskets in everything well I

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.700 
all the gaskets in everything well I
need<00:06:24.480> to<00:06:24.510> get<00:06:24.660> one<00:06:24.780> of<00:06:24.810> those<00:06:24.960> we<00:06:25.200> can<00:06:25.470> actually

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
need to get one of those we can actually

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.070

fit<00:06:25.890> that<00:06:26.010> now<00:06:26.190> but<00:06:26.430> also<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:27.840> interesting

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
fit that now but also the interesting

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.200
