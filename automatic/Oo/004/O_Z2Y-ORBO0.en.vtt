 today we talk about hypericum, hypericum 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 hypericum perforatum is part of the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 family of the ericaceous ip and the part 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.480
 used are the flowery tops to the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.609
 inside we find flavonoids including 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.609
 them perosi de which is best known for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.039
 which in fact it is used to nasto 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 essential oil hyperforin hallways 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 tannins and raccoons lines the Iberian is one 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.969
 shrubby herbaceous plant that arrives 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.190
 approximately up to 60 cm in height 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 kao the thin branched that a little 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.710
 opposites inter and characterized by one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.899
 Translucent punctuation well evident 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.440
 are the flowers usually with five petals 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 bright yellow and are numerous 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 stamens about 60 or 50 and well 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.520
 noticeable characteristic nor proper 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 the smell is used the flowering tops 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 dried in the shade collected the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.949
 flowering consists precisely of flowers 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 leaves and bits of Iberian causes 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.250
 it is used and is known 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.290
 to help depressive anxiety 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.049
 therefore mild in the forms of depression 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 those that give are mild and not endogenous 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 just a bit of sense of sadness 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 physical and mental tiredness therefore 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 obviously more moderate shapes comes 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.040
 also used for external use in 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.369
 sores a cd burns itches like 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.720
 also anti-inflammatory antiseptic 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.790
 it can also be found 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.270
 in shampoos to treat for example 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.620
 greasy or devitalized hair or in 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.410
 cosmetic products for dry skin 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.750
 in tones that therefore always to give a little 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.130
 of activity at the level of the skin 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.990
 obviously the use of hypericum 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.880
 you have to be very careful because 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 can give to interact with any 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.410
 other antidepressant drugs for this 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.410
 it is good to consult the doctor in case 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.330
 which you want to start good care 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.100
 reinvents to interact also with others 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.380
 drugs such as can happen for example 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.640
 with the contraceptive pill it is for 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.560
 always always useful to ask before the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 own doctor's opinion 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
 obviously it is never never a is not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.140
 never recommended in pregnancy or 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.780
 Nursing is found in many 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.520
 supplements the formulations are precisely 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.710
 in tablets or capsules 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.450
 I usually recommend two a day 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.600
 morning and one in the evening 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.250
 away from meals with plenty of water 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 or you can obviously find in 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.520
 herbal tea cutting in this case can be 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.170
 an adjunct perhaps before going to 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.360
 bed to relax to stay a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.209
 a little quieter or dyeing 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.370
 mother then 35 40 drops always two 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.410
 times a day ie morning and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 evening always a little away from meals 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.070
 so I quietly dissolved in a 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.870
 little to water 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.380
 then it is obviously inside 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.300
 of graduated shampoo creams and then a 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.970
 depending on use by mouth or 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.880
 use external 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.720
 an example precisely and that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 of the supplement in tablets for which 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 we find our hypericum who must 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.330
 to be in this case I took 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.030
 quietly in the morning and evening 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.070
 with plenty of water helps during the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.100
 day against states like I said 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.140
 previously of mild depression e 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.030
 help to rest better at night so 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.470
 maybe even in anxious situations 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.360
 can go to relax the person I will 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.040
