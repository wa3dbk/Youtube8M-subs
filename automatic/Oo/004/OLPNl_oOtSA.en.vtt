00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.500
 boy then video wrote from her is 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 for rent very comfortable 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.200
 decidedly basic let's say that one 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 that gives an extra touch and the little coat 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.880
 in faux fur that arrived yesterday 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 by name of course I wanted immediately 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 wear then as a trick I always have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 made a very simple basis 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.220
 then a bit of concealer foundation 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 mineral of the max a little bit of earth 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.040
 of blush in black pencil and mascara e 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 on the lips just passed but with the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.770
 fingers always the lipsticks name of the ny ex 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 in the milan color like earrings on 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 these here that I really know worshiping that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.750
 I'm forever twenty one that I have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 bought in new york and have precisely 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.159
 this turquoise and touring ball 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 around all these rhinestones 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 I remember paying off a bullshit me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 looks like a dollar and 80 so little more 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.890
 one euro and I loved it a lot 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 lately i'm really using it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
 very much these stud earrings 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.320
 I like them to death 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.340
 then I put the tiffany necklace 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.140
 this 4th you already know and on your wrist 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.560
 I wore my new bracelet 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 of the wii positiv series are 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 practically of the faux leather bracelets 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.320
 that just roll up around the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.500
 arm then making more turns and i 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 various variants are of various colors 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 fantasies in other words different and in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.250
 I particularly liked this because 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.680
 tiffany color in fact always type color 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.830
 blue turquoise and then matched 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.310
 good for my earrings and writings 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.150
 in silver and precisely as 19 wii 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.700
 positive are engraved over one whole 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.060
 series of positive sentences in English 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 so for example stay on top down nuns 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.489
 be happy leave your life 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.500
 have a nice day so they are all frauds 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.810
 positive that in this period in short 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.430
 they do not spoil every usual 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.109
 ginky bracelet that says I showed up 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.359
 in an outlet this place too now 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.890
 I really like wearing them together and 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.010
 then this approach in this but this 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.549
 I remind you where I got this way 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.189
 or the bronze globe clock that 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.889
 I wear a lot so the cuff 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.810
 of tiffany and pomace hards while to the 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.180
 I wear this ring that of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 tiffany and this wedding ring instead of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.769
 pomellato then outfit at the state below 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.250
 this very simple white vest 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.109
 which I had bought at the market and is from 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.569
 those that don't take very long 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.379
 too much so I pulled it a little 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.329
 up for the Hon 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.819
 deprive the knees with the vest 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.359
 I know why this shirt has always been 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.159
 very simple blue that of dell imperial 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.010
 and I like it because it still remains beautiful 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.469
 unglued these buttons and then mi 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.780
 like the fact that you let it show anyway 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:24.849
 the undershirt underneath us sweater that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.729
 just zara sweaters I bought 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.109
 the other year with sales and I must say that 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.689
 it was a great buy because i have it 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.989
 really worn a lot and a golf 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.579
 long sleeve and striped woolen stitch 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.919
 white and blue 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.079
 I really like the neckline a 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.299
 a little ample and the thing I like 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.419
 so much this grouper with the 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.250
 red cursor that I love here is this 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.930
 I like the effect of the cardigan 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.430
 very much because here they remain 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.470
 they were more body 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.620
 he is that a little longer is the auction 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.290
 I really like this effect 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.180
 I am in love with things in rows and in 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.620
 I particularly like the most 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 row that is not the classic black white 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.879
 this case just white and blue 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.659
 been these lists of probes miss 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:15.030
 very heavy blue that I took from a 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.060
 milano way to alassio from contact ad 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.829
 Alassio already two or three years ago and me 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.079
 they like them very much because they are gods 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.550
 pants fusers so there is no 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.270
 problem of having to put in force 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.160
 something below are very very present 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.340
 and I really like this queen who 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.620
 have what seam is in front and 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.430
 precisely the entrance because they have the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.910
 practically function as trousers like 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.310
 shoes I wore these commerce that 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.570
 are gray points are in gray in 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.930
 some wool fabrics you see like wool e 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.940
 inside they have no fur 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.550
 proper of the history of that day the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.550
 longhaired year so if when a hair 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.320
 type sheep but it keeps very hot and 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.600
 I really like the different thing 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.250
 fabric and therefore are not whole and only 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.560
 in this beautiful dark gray that if I have them 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.229
 buy in a car on the 4th linen 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.320
 however paid enough 60 70 euros 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.020
 for now to say that only the friends converse 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.280
 chris coady wear this winter 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.520
 clearly fake gray fur jacket 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.080
 who created me and from Roma 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.030
 then it took a long time to get there 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.370
 that is to say, not much even nine lives 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.110
 in the days because I remember what more 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.789
 coordinated with him to decide I said 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.330
 girl craze during the holidays of 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.370
 Christmas 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.849
 in short we had fun looking for a 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.280
 looking for something since it seems to me that 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.770
 there was kind of the cuts that are the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.720
 memory and therefore even if the council 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.490
 the whole statue work is precisely a 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.830
 Pellicciotto I really like the fact that 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.479
 don't have a neck because one can 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.660
 also put a nice big scarf 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.510
 and the fact that inside is completely 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.180
 covered with everything own files 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.940
 everything except the sleeves that anyway 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.150
 but in short his hands was a pact 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.430
 and super super hot the only flaw 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.069
 there are two flaws a poker da 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.919
 what hair because anyway 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.539
 the fake one, that is, a little bit of pear 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.949
 to calculate that I was left yesterday as 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.479
 probably still needs to remove terms 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.629
 has yet to lose a bit of hair 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.030
 the initial one and then the other one that 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.150
 one size so for me they are one 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.940
 40 42 st even if below I dress well 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.979
 as it happened in this case it turns out to me 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.009
 a little bit comfortable 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.840
 so let's say that those less than 40 don't 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.789
 I advise him less for one you don't love 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.879
 things now style because otherwise 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:45.539
 it turns out to be a little comfortable surely it was 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:49.050
 found reality dsm and mail animals 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:51.000
 because however it is a little bit 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.340
 better that I don't love things too much 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.120
 common and forever prefer things 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:00.000
 more adherents, however, you can see that here 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.800
 behind it remains a bit with is true also in 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.009
 that the furs that things to these 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.500
 the adherent other sins profit of David 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.169
 tech and the zipper because I do n't know if 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.300
 notice they made me the zipper 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.580
 really attached to the hair and therefore 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.389
 whenever one pulls on the zipper 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.240
 it gets stuck a thousand times in the hair but not 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.699
 it's the evening jacket while you have to 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.130
 enter a thousand times in our revolt to 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.349
 but get dressed for everything else and I have 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.379
 said only negative things maranzana d'oro 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.430
 because really super hot and I like it 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.430
 very much how he is 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.790
 nobody likes it except in words 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.190
 it's like a down payment in the improv to my 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:52.750
 now the present is very famous 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.720
 whose brand information I leave you the 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.920
 my mail in the terminology box 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.930
 these stories because the way to 

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.540
 take it off as it must come out 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:05.430
 don't think about it then a big kiss 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.430
 all and the next video bye
