the only need to twos a ten millimeter
and<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.580> 12<00:00:08.849> millimeter<00:00:09.150> will<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> whole

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and a 12 millimeter will do the whole

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
and a 12 millimeter will do the whole
works<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.160> use<00:00:11.309> ranches<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.630> want

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
works you can use ranches that you want

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.089 
works you can use ranches that you want
to<00:00:12.900> take<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> lot<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.320> time<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.070> use

ratchet<00:00:14.809> sockets<00:00:15.980> I'm<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.369> power

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
ratchet sockets I'm going to use power

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300 
ratchet sockets I'm going to use power
tools<00:00:17.940> since<00:00:18.449> they're<00:00:18.600> quicker<00:00:18.980> we'll<00:00:19.980> start

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
tools since they're quicker we'll start

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
tools since they're quicker we'll start
by<00:00:20.880> taking<00:00:21.090> these<00:00:21.330> wires<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.810> you've<00:00:22.050> already

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
by taking these wires off you've already

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
by taking these wires off you've already
taken<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> battery<00:00:23.039> cable<00:00:23.400> off<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
taken the battery cable off this is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.670 
taken the battery cable off this is
going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> twelve<00:00:24.930> millimeter<00:00:25.199> right

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
going to be a twelve millimeter right

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
going to be a twelve millimeter right
here<00:00:25.949> take<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.789> off<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> out

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
here take that off and just get it out

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.710 
here take that off and just get it out
of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> way<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.849> course<00:00:29.849> you've<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of the way of course you've got a it's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.209 
of the way of course you've got a it's
going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.019> connected<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
going to be connected all of this this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
going to be connected all of this this
is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> plug<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> wires<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.809> hit

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is just a plug with the wires out hit

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
is just a plug with the wires out hit
retry<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> back<00:00:35.190> side<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.760> squeeze<00:00:36.090> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
retry on the back side and squeeze in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.299 
retry on the back side and squeeze in
and<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.620> pull<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.719> just<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.960> and
