00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.690 
I think hers as best as expensive his
mom<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:31.950> range<00:01:32.189> probably<00:01:32.520> between<00:01:32.850> like

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
mom and they range probably between like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.780 
mom and they range probably between like
maybe<00:01:35.700> fifty<00:01:36.570> dollars<00:01:37.290> i<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.680> ya<00:01:37.979> round<00:01:38.280> you

maybe fifty dollars i think ya round you
could<00:01:38.970> probably<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.479> less<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:39.960> 50<00:01:40.259> but

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
could probably do less than 50 but

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
could probably do less than 50 but
between<00:01:40.890> fifty<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.579> hundred<00:01:41.610> dollars<00:01:42.060> or

between fifty and a hundred dollars or

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
between fifty and a hundred dollars or
more<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.509> usually<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.290> price<00:01:43.500> mine<00:01:44.220> was

it or you can have with or without

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.250 
it or you can have with or without
rhinestones<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.389> all<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.750> all<00:04:48.960> kinds<00:04:49.229> of

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
rhinestones and all just all kinds of

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.379 
rhinestones and all just all kinds of
cool<00:04:49.410> stuff<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> just<00:04:50.550> absolutely<00:04:50.790> love<00:04:51.360> it

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
cool stuff but I just absolutely love it

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.950 
cool stuff but I just absolutely love it
and<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:52.310> Chinese<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.430> think<00:04:53.610> 16<00:04:53.970> inches<00:04:54.300> it's

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
and this Chinese I think 16 inches it's

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.570 
and this Chinese I think 16 inches it's
a<00:04:55.050> little<00:04:55.260> long<00:04:55.380> for<00:04:55.440> me<00:04:55.830> though<00:04:56.100> because<00:04:56.280> it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
a little long for me though because it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.340 
a little long for me though because it
since<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.000> hangs<00:04:57.540> still<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:58.020> bit<00:04:58.200> longer

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
since it hangs still a little bit longer

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.159 
since it hangs still a little bit longer
so<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> usually<00:04:59.340> kind<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.580> have<00:04:59.729> to<00:04:59.900> move<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.050> up

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
so I usually kind of have to move it up

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.430 
so I usually kind of have to move it up
a<00:05:01.410> good<00:05:01.620> inch<00:05:02.370> or<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.850> still<00:05:03.210> yet<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:03.600> it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
a good inch or so still yet so it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.090 
a good inch or so still yet so it
doesn't<00:05:04.830> fall<00:05:05.340> into<00:05:05.669> my<00:05:05.910> chart<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:07.440> yeah<00:05:07.710> and

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
doesn't fall into my chart but yeah and

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.400 
doesn't fall into my chart but yeah and
hopefully<00:05:08.639> all<00:05:08.669> enjoyed<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.630> look<00:05:10.080> for
