00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 men's short program single 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.429
 skating 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 moment to us 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.890
 welcomes not taipan spanish tribunes 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.960
 the more so that he is trained by a Canadian 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.560
 Brian Orser is also a spectator 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560
 naturally know 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:16.240
 the quad Salchow was immaculately 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.240
 performed 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.060
 Yes 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.060
 Spaniard's wonderful start 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:42.280
 for the first two elements then see 24 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.280
 almost 25 points 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.509
 but axel shook only double 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.140
 there is no certainty that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.740
 when technical terms go into 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.310
 javier fernandez result 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.310
 Din Menshov well that led him 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.920
 let him down of course 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.730
 axel only double was that is 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 program 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.810
 Of course harder Constantine Menshov 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:15.209
 but of course 2 at the end 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.430
 the referee did not hurt it too obvious 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.780
 of course he should lead now 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.560
 standings 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.070
 I look at the ratings for the components very 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.730
 good highest of eight with 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.240
 half to nine points with such 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.240
 components
