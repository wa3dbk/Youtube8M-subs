but they have different artwork on them
and<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.859> just<00:03:50.010> want<00:03:50.159> to<00:03:50.190> show<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.750> examples<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
and I just want to show you examples of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.479 
and I just want to show you examples of
the<00:03:52.079> artwork<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> game<00:03:52.859> because<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.310> game

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
the artwork in the game because the game

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.940 
the artwork in the game because the game
itself<00:03:53.640> has<00:03:54.569> some<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.049> gorgeous<00:03:55.470> aren't

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
itself has some really gorgeous aren't

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.190 
itself has some really gorgeous aren't
working<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.340> we<00:03:57.209> do<00:03:57.359> not<00:03:57.510> want<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.720> gloss<00:03:58.019> over

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
working so we do not want to gloss over

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.710 
working so we do not want to gloss over
that<00:03:58.349> fact<00:03:58.680> how<00:03:58.950> each<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.549> every<00:03:59.760> card<00:04:00.060> has<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
that fact how each and every card has a

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.530 
that fact how each and every card has a
different<00:04:01.319> look<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.940> players<00:04:03.269> will

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
different look to it and so players will

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.509 
different look to it and so players will
probably<00:04:03.840> spend<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.140> lot<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.290> time<00:04:04.409> looking<00:04:05.220> at

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
probably spend a lot of time looking at

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.089 
probably spend a lot of time looking at
the<00:04:05.640> cards<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.090> their<00:04:06.239> hand<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.980> know

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
the cards in their hand and you know

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.339 
the cards in their hand and you know
just<00:04:08.370> admiring<00:04:08.730> them<00:04:09.090> except<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.019> wild

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
just admiring them except for the wild

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.170 
just admiring them except for the wild
the<00:04:10.769> wild<00:04:10.799> card<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.370> kind<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.639> weird<00:04:11.760> looking

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the wild card is kind of weird looking

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.210 
the wild card is kind of weird looking
but<00:04:12.750> other<00:04:12.870> than<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.109> everything<00:04:14.069> looks

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
but other than that everything looks

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.379 
but other than that everything looks
really<00:04:14.430> good<00:04:15.889> all<00:04:16.889> right<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.579> game<00:04:17.820> has

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349

art I guess great photography isn't as
in<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.650> game<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:30.180> idea<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:30.990> game<00:04:31.229> of<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
in this game the idea of this game of a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.950 
in this game the idea of this game of a
tour<00:04:32.099> agency<00:04:32.340> having<00:04:33.180> different<00:04:33.449> tours<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.870> go

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
tour agency having different tours to go

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.189 
tour agency having different tours to go
around<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.260> see<00:04:34.380> things<00:04:34.620> great<00:04:35.550> theming<00:04:36.199> the

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
around and see things great theming the

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.350 
around and see things great theming the
gameplay<00:04:37.650> itself<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:38.660> okay<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.960> think<00:04:41.360> you're

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
gameplay itself is okay I think you're

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.659 
gameplay itself is okay I think you're
just<00:04:42.620> collecting<00:04:43.620> sets<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.220> cards<00:04:44.460> but

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
just collecting sets of cards but

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.219 
just collecting sets of cards but
drawing<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:45.060> card<00:04:45.270> off<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.510> top<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.930> hoping<00:04:46.139> to

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
drawing a card off the top and hoping to

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.589 
drawing a card off the top and hoping to
get<00:04:46.320> one<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.590> need<00:04:46.770> gets<00:04:47.340> really<00:04:47.940> old<00:04:47.970> after<00:04:48.419> a

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
get one you need gets really old after a

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.659 
get one you need gets really old after a
while<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.229> can<00:04:49.410> rearrange<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.220> cards<00:04:50.520> but

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
while you can rearrange the cards but

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.610 
while you can rearrange the cards but
that<00:04:50.820> doesn't<00:04:51.150> help<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.570> because<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.440> might

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
that doesn't help you because you might

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.390 
that doesn't help you because you might
be<00:04:52.740> helping<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.099> next<00:04:53.340> person<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.880> line<00:04:53.940> and

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
be helping the next person in line and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.500 
be helping the next person in line and
so<00:04:56.400> that's<00:04:56.550> kind<00:04:56.849> of<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.000> pain<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.419> neck

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
so that's kind of a pain in the neck

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.300 
so that's kind of a pain in the neck
unless<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.169> works<00:04:58.320> out<00:04:58.470> for<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.740> or<00:04:58.949> if<00:04:59.190> you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
unless it works out for you or if you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.909 
unless it works out for you or if you
have<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.580> good<00:04:59.729> monkeys<00:05:00.349> or<00:05:01.349> your<00:05:01.650> thoughts

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
um I kind of like this game because I

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.510 
um I kind of like this game because I

like how you really he's bad monkeys
upon<00:05:08.820> other<00:05:09.000> people<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.830> put<00:05:11.550> out<00:05:11.699> Ram

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
upon other people like I I put out Ram

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.140 
upon other people like I I put out Ram
cards<00:05:12.570> everyone's<00:05:12.930> off<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:13.650> like<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.940> said

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
cards everyone's off but like I said

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.050 
cards everyone's off but like I said
after<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.659> while<00:05:15.870> um<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:17.159> didn't<00:05:17.580> really<00:05:17.700> like

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
after a while um I didn't really like

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.970 
after a while um I didn't really like
to<00:05:18.270> put<00:05:18.570> out<00:05:18.600> random<00:05:19.080> cards<00:05:19.410> anymore<00:05:19.680> because

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
to put out random cards anymore because

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.680 
to put out random cards anymore because
the<00:05:20.400> bad<00:05:20.520> monkeys<00:05:20.880> always<00:05:21.060> like<00:05:21.270> took<00:05:21.450> them

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
the bad monkeys always like took them

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.330 
the bad monkeys always like took them
away<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.280> it's<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.460> wider<00:05:24.330> idea<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:25.110> not<00:05:25.260> put<00:05:26.130> out

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
away so it's a wider idea to not put out

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.730 
away so it's a wider idea to not put out
random<00:05:26.880> cards<00:05:27.210> because<00:05:28.050> they're<00:05:28.290> like<00:05:28.440> always

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
random cards because they're like always

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.850 
random cards because they're like always
taking<00:05:29.010> away<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.550> wise<00:05:29.700> monkey<00:05:30.120> like<00:05:30.389> I

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
taking away and the wise monkey like I

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.050 
taking away and the wise monkey like I

this<00:05:41.610> game<00:05:41.880> because<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:43.139> bad<00:05:43.350> monkey<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:43.889> you

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
this game because that bad monkey if you

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.740 
this game because that bad monkey if you
draw<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.280> bad<00:05:44.490> monkey<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:44.910> turn<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.210> get<00:05:45.389> no

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
draw a bad monkey in turn you get no

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.360 
draw a bad monkey in turn you get no
positive<00:05:46.380> benefit<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.800> fact<00:05:46.980> there's<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.190> good

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
positive benefit in fact there's a good

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.400 
positive benefit in fact there's a good
chance<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.730> will<00:05:47.760> hurt<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.450> so<00:05:49.050> that's

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
chance it will hurt you and so that's

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.290 
chance it will hurt you and so that's
just<00:05:49.770> too<00:05:49.980> lucky<00:05:50.340> for<00:05:50.520> me<00:05:50.639> to<00:05:50.820> draw<00:05:51.000> that<00:05:51.030> bad

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
just too lucky for me to draw that bad

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.430 
just too lucky for me to draw that bad
monkey<00:05:51.570> then<00:05:51.690> someone<00:05:51.930> else<00:05:51.960> draws<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.290> good

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
monkey then someone else draws a good

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.530 
monkey then someone else draws a good
monkey<00:05:52.710> if<00:05:53.220> you<00:05:53.400> draw<00:05:53.610> several<00:05:54.030> bad<00:05:54.270> monkeys

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
monkey if you draw several bad monkeys

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.760 
monkey if you draw several bad monkeys
and<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:54.780> my<00:05:54.870> own<00:05:54.930> straw<00:05:55.110> several<00:05:55.380> good<00:05:55.500> monkeys

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
and so my own straw several good monkeys

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.950 
and so my own straw several good monkeys
they<00:05:55.889> are<00:05:55.979> probably<00:05:56.520> going<00:05:56.729> to<00:05:56.880> win<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.810> whole

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
they are probably going to win the whole

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.240 
they are probably going to win the whole
thing<00:05:57.990> about<00:05:58.260> collecting<00:05:58.680> since<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.919> cards

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
thing about collecting since the cards

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.650 
thing about collecting since the cards
and<00:05:59.370> playing<00:05:59.580> them<00:05:59.669> is<00:05:59.790> an<00:05:59.910> interesting<00:06:00.270> thing

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
and playing them is an interesting thing

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.330 
and playing them is an interesting thing
but<00:06:00.900> essentially<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.650> comes<00:06:01.680> down<00:06:01.950> to<00:06:02.250> the

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
but essentially it comes down to the

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.909 
but essentially it comes down to the
luck<00:06:02.520> there<00:06:03.120> is<00:06:03.300> ZERO<00:06:03.440> tactics<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.560> strategy

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
luck there is ZERO tactics and strategy

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.680 
luck there is ZERO tactics and strategy
in<00:06:04.979> this<00:06:05.070> game<00:06:05.280> practically<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:06.000> mean<00:06:06.389> yes<00:06:06.660> you

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
in this game practically I mean yes you

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.200 
in this game practically I mean yes you
can<00:06:07.110> choose<00:06:07.590> what<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.160> do<00:06:08.370> but<00:06:08.639> it's<00:06:08.790> just<00:06:09.000> so

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
can choose what to do but it's just so

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.540 
can choose what to do but it's just so
obvious<00:06:09.450> I'm<00:06:09.930> going<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.530> take<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.710> card<00:06:11.040> why

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
obvious I'm going to take a card why

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.790 
obvious I'm going to take a card why
would<00:06:11.760> you<00:06:11.790> rearrange<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.570> cards<00:06:13.080> unless<00:06:13.620> you

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
would you rearrange the cards unless you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.110 
would you rearrange the cards unless you
have<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:13.979> good<00:06:14.250> monkey<00:06:14.550> lets<00:06:14.850> you<00:06:14.940> rearrange

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
have the good monkey lets you rearrange

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.150 
have the good monkey lets you rearrange
them<00:06:15.450> and<00:06:15.570> then<00:06:15.660> take<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.990> one<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.260> need<00:06:16.440> or

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
them and then take the one you need or

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.770 
them and then take the one you need or
you<00:06:17.220> can<00:06:17.520> rearrange<00:06:17.760> it<00:06:18.120> trying<00:06:18.389> to<00:06:18.510> mess

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
you can rearrange it trying to mess

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.110 
you can rearrange it trying to mess
somebody<00:06:19.110> else<00:06:19.500> up<00:06:19.740> I<00:06:19.919> guess<00:06:20.190> but<00:06:20.550> that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
somebody else up I guess but that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.029 
somebody else up I guess but that
doesn't<00:06:21.270> help<00:06:21.630> you<00:06:21.960> at<00:06:21.990> all<00:06:22.260> so<00:06:22.530> why<00:06:22.770> are<00:06:22.830> you

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
doesn't help you at all so why are you

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.380 
doesn't help you at all so why are you
doing<00:06:23.250> that<00:06:23.280> you're<00:06:23.580> better<00:06:23.669> off<00:06:23.820> drawing<00:06:24.300> a

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
doing that you're better off drawing a

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
doing that you're better off drawing a
card<00:06:24.660> for<00:06:25.470> me<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:25.740> one<00:06:25.950> is<00:06:26.070> a<00:06:26.100> big<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:27.539> I<00:06:27.960> was

card for me this one is a big the I was

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.200 
card for me this one is a big the I was
