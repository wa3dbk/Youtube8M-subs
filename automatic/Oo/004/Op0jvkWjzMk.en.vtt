00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.410
 de tafí is not the pioneer and leader 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.790
 global irrigation in low volume which 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.920
 has the widest experience 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.560
 agro-technical in irrigation systems 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.570
 drip technology that has proven to be 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.000
 the most efficient for the management of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.240
 sugarcane crops and the best 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.609
 solution for the technification of irrigation 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.769
 drip is an automated system that 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.499
 controls the application of small doses 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.440
 of water and nutrients directly to 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.940
 radicular area of ​​plants 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.579
 supplying the exact amounts of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.850
 water and nutrients that the plant needs 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.429
 drip maximizes performance operates 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.219
 at low pressure reducing the costs of 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.949
 energy reduces the risks of 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.629
 diseases minimizes the stress of 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.149
 plant which improves the quality of the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.059
 Cultivation ensures a uniform application 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.369
 of water and nutrients reduces erosion 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.149
 of soil and the use of fertilizers that 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.110
 can contaminate aquifers 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.320
 minimize costs 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.850
 before it preserves arable land and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.850
 allows the son of marginal lands 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 the need to increase production 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.570
 of sugarcane to the system of 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.550
 drip irrigation as the best solution 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.470
 we can achieve higher yields 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.360
 very attractive compounds for 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.240
 producers is a very good investment 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.020
 that if it's worth it and if then here what 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.940
 We have seen 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.130
 The advantage of this is that 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.910
 we despise water as much as in other 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.500
 dante parts or shot and is much 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.810
 water that is wasted here not here 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.060
 everything goes to the root of the plant 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.420
 and nutrients everything goes where the company in 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 this faith 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.430
 the material that we handle is 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.890
 three that I'm in charge of everything and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.350
 I have two one that takes care of here 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.270
 a head of what the system is and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 another who is not crushing anything 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.410
 we have no open keys if 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.970
 there is a problem of no technique 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.230
 Water 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 to fix it the property is 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.769
 an area of ​​123 50 is a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.650
 uneven terrain surface like 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.290
 you can observe and we have here the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.200
 planting sugarcane here 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.799
 we have a variety called cp 72 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.140
 20 86 is a variety of precocious type 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.720
 this means that always its maturity 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.870
 is reached in the first third of the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.900
 harvest that is from January to November 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.840
 January is a variety of very high 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:03:02.670
 sucrose percentage very good for 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 sugar in which is the heart of 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.450
 irrigation system here from the ranch where 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.510
 we found ourselves basically is the pumping 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.940
 where we send water to 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 different batches this filtering area 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.620
 will give us the quality of the water 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.170
 that we have no blockage of any 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.600
 type of the droppers once the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.640
 water is filtered let's do the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.770
 fertilizer injection the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.340
 fertilizer concretely that we are 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.640
 applying here is soluble we can 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.440
 work with solid fertilizers 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.110
 in an area of a premix 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.540
 premix tank we dilute them in water 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.330
 according to the solubility that it has 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.840
 each element later we had 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.120
 to some tanks that are going to be ready 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.940
 through a team of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.820
 fertilization a fertile kit make the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.090
 fertilizer edition to the flow of 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.310
 water in the water flow be fertile 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.020
 will allow us to handle different 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.360
 volumes according to the nutrition that 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.060
 is required according to the stage of 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.940
 culture that we are working and so 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.459
 directly we will no longer irrigate all 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.799
 the different lots of the ranch 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.930
 basically netafin does the training 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.230
 of all the technical personnel in charge 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.500
 of the ranch in order that 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.360
 any questions you have on the subject 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.480
 example of the solubility of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.669
 fertilizer the watering hours the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.160
 interpretation of the irrigation sheet 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.689
 how to interpret evaporation in 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.149
 environmental conditions 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.399
 and infer and make the irrigation tables 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:45.149
 all this is an accompaniment that is 

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:48.749
 Gives the client through his staff 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:48.749
 responsible in each ranch 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.770
 the average performance of the area in 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.139
 gravity irrigation is 150 tons 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.020
 per hectare in reeds with a yield 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.449
 monthly of 9.4 tons per hectare 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.759
 while the cane harvested with irrigation 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.380
 drip has higher performance 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:25.380
 one hundred ninety-nine tons per 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.380
 hectare 33% more monthly profit 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.260
 as a global goal 50 company with 16 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.170
 factories and 27 subsidiaries in which 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.390
 more than 3,000 employees work 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.720
 markets its products in more than 110 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.280
 countries in netafin we help the world to 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.280
 grow more with less
