00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.500
 hello and welcome to my nexus for 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.650
 this new video about a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.919
 translation and not least that of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.349
 the legacy of the dragon child 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.060
 the excellent legacy of the den born of ice 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.579
 assassin cream first of all a 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.950
 warning this mode is consistent and 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.520
 will ask you to download about 1 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.290
 Once activated, it will take at least 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.739
 givet two vaccines on your disk 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.309
 hard 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:52.000
 so be careful if you have your skyrim 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.249
 will ssd that you count a little the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.170
 place or if you have a small 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.570
 connection you will need some 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.769
 time to download the mode that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.649
 by the way is in two parts 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.480
 but we will come back to the legacy of 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.220
 the dragon child is anchored in the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.590
 prophecies the myths legends as well 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 that history itself the mode you 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.850
 so will explore a past 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.270
 forgotten and discover the relics 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.520
 lost 17 dragon children that they have 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.280
 preceded the mode will also allow you 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.130
 to learn more about the lost alliance 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.140
 with at 14 which is causing for those 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 who know it well when 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.150
 powers of dragon children mode 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.970
 adds to consequent content as I 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.250
 already wanted to say starting with amused 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.260
 in the city of loneliness where I you 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.300
 advise to go to talk to 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.510
 conservatives would have died and luce 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.230
 the mode and in several parts indeed 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.740
 you will have this museum to fill with various 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.030
 objects and as and when this museum 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.370
 will be more a hub for lots of quests 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.280
 that will allow you to go to the 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 search for lost artifacts and a very 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.330
 big quest called and dairy 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.940
 broken which is actually a series of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.750
 quests that will bring you to number of 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.569
 rewards and will allow you to undergo 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.280
 some twists in the museum 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.069
 itself there will be more than 1000 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.050
 location to make your display age 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.570
 so the weapons 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 even paintings and so on as I 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.740
 just told you he will also have to 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.360
 new books etc and the museum itself 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.490
 understand your secrets that you 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 will discover to discover 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.390
 also serve you 2 dice with regard to the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.490
 number of objects that can be understood by the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.950
 museum it can quickly become tedious 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.400
 to place the objects in the right place and 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.260
 well the modder has provided a system that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.960
 place the objects present in your 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.880
 inventory automatically to the correct 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.200
 location with regard to the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.810
 translation she herself took me 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.030
 a lot of time because the mode 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.790
 includes a lot of books and input 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.850
 with lots of line in for 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.540
 information an entry can contain a 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.820
 sentence hello hi or may contain a 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.250
 whole book or description he has 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.790
 had to work with the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.770
 moddeur who updates his translation 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.770
 regularly in order to reach a point 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.320
 where it will not receive any more that 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.860
 object and will not add kate and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 dialogue 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.290
 so he continues to work on a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.110
 number of objects the correction 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.760
 bugs and various mechanisms 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.620
 I will update the mode at 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.780
 as and when but I will wait 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.290
 perhaps three versions because sometimes 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.560
 the modder updates its translation a 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.280
 times a week regarding 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.890
 Installation 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.650
 first you have to go to the page 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.070
 original mode so the page in 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.470
 English 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.220
 go to the files tab 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.530
 take the basic version so this one 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.500
 do download manager as you can 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.810
 see him after two nights without equal this 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.050
 version is necessary because the tate 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.590
 which contains all the files 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.540
 necessary to the modes still use 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.780
 some elements of the original bessat 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.109
 then once this download 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 will be finished you will have to activate the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.910
 fashion 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:31.870
 so far no problem go to the page 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.870
 from translation to helping files 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.819
 download manager effect on the patch 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.280
 legacy of the dragon terminals which is 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.990
 not a patch fr actually that includes 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.539
 the whole mode with the different 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.240
 esp but as I dedicate you we have 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.190
 need the original bessat so I 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.720
 preferred the name do to patch 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.360
 that there is no ambiguity 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.759
 indeed some users are 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.319
 really more than just beginner so I can 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.270
 to take precautions to 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.280
 some even if it's not really 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.889
 exact this is a patch that you 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.009
 be a beginner or others I take advantage 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.080
 to make a little digression again 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.810
 read the descriptions of the modes in 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.780
 the corresponding tab 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.810
 read the posts on the forum 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.470
 concept tab before asking your 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.840
 question 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.940
 to come back now to the mode a 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.020
 Once you have downloaded is 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.909
 download manager on the patch activate the 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 you will be asked to crush some 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.879
 files made 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.289
 yes or yes to all who is too bad on a 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.300
 or two of the files you will need to do 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.620
 reyes because you can not do 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.780
 world wild fund 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.750
 according to the modes you have installed 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.130
 and that will be all for this video 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.870
 about this translation 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.460
 before leaving you I want to 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.479
 answer a question that I was asked 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.849
