from<00:01:37.700> pushing<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.570> in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
from pushing it all the way down in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
from pushing it all the way down in
there<00:01:41.240> well<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> easy<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> one

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there well not as easy as what this one

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.039 
there well not as easy as what this one
does<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.479> doesn't<00:01:45.509> even<00:01:45.810> have

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
does because this one doesn't even have

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
does because this one doesn't even have
like<00:01:46.399> anything<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.939> anchor<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.450> in

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like anything that will anchor it in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
like anything that will anchor it in
whereas<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.009> I'll<00:01:50.579> probably

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
whereas this one does so I'll probably

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
whereas this one does so I'll probably
start<00:01:51.420> using<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.380> her<00:01:52.470> afternoon
