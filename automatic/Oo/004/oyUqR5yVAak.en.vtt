00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
really remember the details these are

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
really remember the details these are
just<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> couple<00:01:09.510> problems<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.409> being

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
just a couple problems with not being

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
just a couple problems with not being
connected<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.159> whiteboards<00:01:11.700> Plus<00:01:12.540> think

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
connected to your whiteboards Plus think

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
connected to your whiteboards Plus think
about<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> information<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> erased

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
about all the information that is erased

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
about all the information that is erased
and<00:01:15.659> lost<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.080> every<00:01:16.470> cubicle<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.040> conference

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and lost in every cubicle and conference

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
and lost in every cubicle and conference
room<00:01:17.610> every<00:01:18.299> day<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.830> when<00:01:19.830> multiplied<00:01:20.369> over

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
room every day and when multiplied over

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
room every day and when multiplied over
an<00:01:20.970> entire<00:01:21.270> organization<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.650> translates

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
an entire organization this translates

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
an entire organization this translates
into<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.450> lost<00:01:24.689> intellectual<00:01:25.409> property

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
into a lot of lost intellectual property

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.910 
into a lot of lost intellectual property
I<00:01:26.070> mean<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.299> collected<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.290> lost<00:01:28.500> ideas

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I mean if I collected all the lost ideas

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
I mean if I collected all the lost ideas
from<00:01:29.130> those<00:01:29.280> whiteboards<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.450> have

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
from those whiteboards I could have

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.649 
from those whiteboards I could have
started<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.049> five<00:01:31.470> companies<00:01:31.860> by<00:01:32.250> now

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
started like five companies by now

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
started like five companies by now
anyway<00:01:33.710> Lou<00:01:34.710> IDIA<00:01:34.950> came<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
anyway Lou IDIA came up with this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.390 
anyway Lou IDIA came up with this
awesome<00:01:35.759> solution<00:01:36.360> called<00:01:36.780> EB<00:01:37.079> Mitch

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
awesome solution called EB Mitch

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
awesome solution called EB Mitch
basically<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.939> small<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.600> mean<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
basically it's a small I mean really

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.859 
basically it's a small I mean really
small<00:01:41.250> device<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> crazy<00:01:42.600> cool

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
small device with this crazy cool

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
small device with this crazy cool
technology<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.979> tracks<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> position<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
technology that tracks the position of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.800 
technology that tracks the position of
your<00:01:44.939> markers<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> board<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.540> put<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
your markers on the board so you put it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.740 
your markers on the board so you put it
on<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.110> whiteboard<00:01:49.680> tabletop<00:01:50.549> glass<00:01:51.180> wall<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
on any whiteboard tabletop glass wall I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
on any whiteboard tabletop glass wall I
don't<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.409> whatever<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
don't know whatever you use when you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670
