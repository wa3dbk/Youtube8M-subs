00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040 

I'm<00:00:00.240> gonna<00:00:00.329> say<00:00:00.480> something<00:00:00.659> it's<00:00:00.810> gonna<00:00:00.900> be<00:00:00.989> a

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.050 
I'm gonna say something it's gonna be a

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.200 
I'm gonna say something it's gonna be a
bit<00:00:01.170> provocative<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:02.159> just<00:00:02.669> think<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:02.909> this

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
bit provocative so just think about this

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.550 
bit provocative so just think about this
if<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.480> could<00:00:03.659> put<00:00:03.810> cells<00:00:04.020> there<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.319> rejuvenate

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
if I could put cells there to rejuvenate

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.530 
if I could put cells there to rejuvenate
that<00:00:04.859> we'd<00:00:05.220> be<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.400> great<00:00:05.490> shape<00:00:05.609> but<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.180> think

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
that we'd be in great shape but I think

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.070 
that we'd be in great shape but I think
Oprah<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> stem-cell<00:00:07.529> debate<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.250> dead<00:00:09.080> and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
Oprah the stem-cell debate is dead and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.379 
Oprah the stem-cell debate is dead and
I'll<00:00:10.200> tell<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.530> why<00:00:10.759> we<00:00:11.759> would<00:00:11.969> take<00:00:12.120> stem

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I'll tell you why we would take stem

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
I'll tell you why we would take stem
cells<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.900> theory<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.500> put<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.040> through<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
cells in theory and put it through a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.770 
cells in theory and put it through a
trocar<00:00:14.670> like<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.150> yeah

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
trocar like this yeah

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
trocar like this yeah
and<00:00:15.870> inject<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> into<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> brain<00:00:17.190> from<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and inject it into the brain from the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.200 
and inject it into the brain from the
right<00:00:18.390> spot<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.960> we'll<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.210> poke

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
right spot and we'll come up and poke

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
right spot and we'll come up and poke
his<00:00:21.359> head<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> we'd<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.680> able<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
his head in there and we'd be able to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.439 
his head in there and we'd be able to
put<00:00:23.100> cells<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> replace<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
put cells in there to replace that

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
put cells in there to replace that
really<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> hope<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really and that's what the hope was the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.810 
really and that's what the hope was the
problem<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:28.080> embryonic<00:00:28.470> stem<00:00:29.160> cells<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
problem was with embryonic stem cells is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880 
problem was with embryonic stem cells is
that<00:00:30.330> embryonic<00:00:30.900> stem<00:00:31.199> cells<00:00:31.500> come<00:00:31.859> from

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that embryonic stem cells come from

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
that embryonic stem cells come from
embryos<00:00:32.550> yeah<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> us<00:00:33.450> were<00:00:33.630> made

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
embryos yeah like all of us were made

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
embryos yeah like all of us were made
from<00:00:33.809> embryos<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> those<00:00:34.590> cells<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> become

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
from embryos and those cells can become

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
from embryos and those cells can become
any<00:00:35.460> cell<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> body<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.480> very<00:00:36.630> hard

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
any cell in the body but it's very hard

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
any cell in the body but it's very hard
to<00:00:37.050> control<00:00:37.380> them<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.850> become

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to control them and so they can become

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.630 
to control them and so they can become
cancer<00:00:39.739> but<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.520> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cancer but in the time of all this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
cancer but in the time of all this
fighting<00:00:42.120> we've<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.899> did<00:00:43.200> slow<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
fighting we've had which did slow down I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
fighting we've had which did slow down I
think<00:00:44.190> allowed<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.820> research<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.690> have

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
think allowed this research there have

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
think allowed this research there have
been<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> huge<00:00:46.590> amount<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.160> changes<00:00:47.670> made<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
been a huge amount of changes made in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.180 
been a huge amount of changes made in
the<00:00:48.120> last<00:00:48.360> year<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.079> made<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.500> 10<00:00:49.829> years<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the last year we made a 10 years of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
the last year we made a 10 years of
advancement<00:00:50.700> thinking<00:00:51.510> last<00:00:51.780> year<00:00:52.050> we've

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
advancement thinking last year we've

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080 
advancement thinking last year we've
advanced<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.800> years<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.370> made<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.789> went<00:00:53.969> places

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
advanced in years we made me went places

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.220 
advanced in years we made me went places
we<00:00:54.270> never<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.570> we'd<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.899> here's<00:00:55.110> what

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
we never thought we'd go and here's what

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
we never thought we'd go and here's what
the<00:00:55.320> deal<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.250> take<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the deal is I can take a little bit of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.900 
the deal is I can take a little bit of
your<00:00:57.000> skin<00:00:57.320> take<00:00:58.320> those<00:00:58.590> cells<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
your skin take those cells get them to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.150 
your skin take those cells get them to
go<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.539> time<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.379> they're<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.800> they

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
go back in time so they're like they

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
go back in time so they're like they
were<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.910> were<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.180> made<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> then

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
were when you were first made and then

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.289 
were when you were first made and then
they<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.040> start<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> dopamine

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
they will start to make that dopamine

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719 
they will start to make that dopamine
and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.530> those<00:01:07.830> cells<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.580> they

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and I think those cells because they

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
and I think those cells because they
won't<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.240> prone<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> cancer<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.260> because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
won't be as prone to cancer and because

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.590 
won't be as prone to cancer and because
they're<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.890> genes<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> ones

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they're your genes will be the ones

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
they're your genes will be the ones
they're<00:01:12.810> ultimately<00:01:13.080> used<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.010> cure

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
they're ultimately used to cure

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
they're ultimately used to cure
Parkinson's<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.180> no<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> tell<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.320> fast

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
Parkinson's and no one can tell how fast

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
Parkinson's and no one can tell how fast
we<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.240> talked<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> lot

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
we can do this but I've talked to a lot

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
we can do this but I've talked to a lot
of<00:01:18.840> experts<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.530> field<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.400> think

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
of experts in this field and I think

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
of experts in this field and I think
we're<00:01:20.820> single-digit<00:01:21.450> years<00:01:21.630> away<00:01:21.930> from

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we're single-digit years away from

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.469 
we're single-digit years away from
making<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.040> big<00:01:23.070> impact<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.909> lives<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
making a big impact in lives of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
making a big impact in lives of
Parkinson's<00:01:25.049> disease<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:25.590> diabetics

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
Parkinson's disease but also diabetics

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
Parkinson's disease but also diabetics
heart<00:01:26.670> attack<00:01:26.909> victims<00:01:27.299> people<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.659> had<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
heart attack victims people have had a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.920 
heart attack victims people have had a
lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> single<00:01:28.829> digits<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.549> digit<00:01:30.060> years<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
lot of single digits or digit years so

we have a right if there's answers out
there<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.719> pursue<00:02:04.020> those<00:02:04.170> answers<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
there to pursue those answers with the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.150 
there to pursue those answers with the
full<00:02:05.009> support<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.210> politicians<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.160> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
full support of our politicians and and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740 
full support of our politicians and and
so<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> don't<00:02:08.819> need<00:02:08.940> anyone's<00:02:09.300> permission<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
so I don't need anyone's permission to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.279 
so I don't need anyone's permission to
do<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
do that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.760 
do that
but<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> point<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.670> cells<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
but the point is that the cells the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.760 
but the point is that the cells the
that<00:02:13.040> we're<00:02:13.250> not<00:02:13.850> using<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:15.470> being

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that we're not using they're being

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.710 
that we're not using they're being
wasted<00:02:16.220> hundreds<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.000> thousands<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.480> cells

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
wasted hundreds of thousands of cells

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.690 
wasted hundreds of thousands of cells
there<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.740> are<00:02:18.860> left<00:02:19.070> over<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.460> vitro

there that are left over from your vitro

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.600 
there that are left over from your vitro
fertilisation<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.960> being<00:02:21.260> thrown<00:02:21.620> away<00:02:21.740> are

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
fertilisation are being thrown away are

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.980 
fertilisation are being thrown away are
being<00:02:22.850> wasted<00:02:23.000> they're<00:02:23.450> not<00:02:23.570> gonna<00:02:23.690> become

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
being wasted they're not gonna become

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.810 
being wasted they're not gonna become
life<00:02:24.200> they're<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.250> going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> become<00:02:25.640> life

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
life they're not going to become life

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.690 
life they're not going to become life
they're<00:02:26.030> being<00:02:26.210> thrown<00:02:26.390> away<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:28.490> that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
they're being thrown away so in that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.980 
they're being thrown away so in that
sense<00:02:28.970> people<00:02:29.180> say<00:02:29.420> protecting<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> unborn

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
sense people say protecting the unborn

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.190 
sense people say protecting the unborn
but<00:02:30.920> they're<00:02:31.280> gonna<00:02:31.400> be<00:02:31.520> destroyed<00:02:32.210> anyway<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
but they're gonna be destroyed anyway so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.360 
but they're gonna be destroyed anyway so
let's<00:02:33.380> use<00:02:33.560> ourselves<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.040> protect<00:02:34.280> the
