Preparing devices is the first step in any
IOS device deployment for your school.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.190
Use the Prepare feature in Apple Configurator
to quickly define and apply configurations,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.000
install apps, and, update IOS to batches of
new IOS devices.

You need to prepare devices before you can
supervise them or assign them to users.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.150
When preparing a device you are linking the
IOS device with the computer that is hosting

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.520
Apple Configurator.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.909
The very first step is to supervise the devices.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.739
Connect the dock end of the cable to the iPad.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.950
Launch Apple Configurator and ensure that
you are in the Prepare mode.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:03:17.150
Plug 
in the USB 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:35.139

00:03:35.139 --> 00:04:01.039
your computer.
