00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
then what you want to do is you want to
wait<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.840> let<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.409> ahead<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> dry<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
wait and let it go ahead and dry for a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
wait and let it go ahead and dry for a
couple<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.340> days<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:39.150> day<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.479> least<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.780> day

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
couple of days or day at least a day

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
couple of days or day at least a day
because<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> start<00:01:40.770> maxing<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> don't

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
because when you start maxing you don't

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
because when you start maxing you don't
want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> pull<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> paint<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.450> let<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
want to pull the paint off so let that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
want to pull the paint off so let that
dry<00:01:43.680> good<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.360> next<00:01:45.600> step<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:47.720> grab

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
dry good and then the next step is grab

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.179 
dry good and then the next step is grab
the<00:01:48.899> tape<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.670> like<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> use<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> 3m<00:01:52.189> fine

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the tape here I like to use the 3m fine

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
the tape here I like to use the 3m fine
line<00:01:53.490> masking<00:01:54.329> tape<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.780> lot<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> people<00:01:55.530> don't

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
line masking tape a lot of people don't

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
line masking tape a lot of people don't
know<00:01:55.799> about<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.610> real<00:01:56.820> rubbery

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
know about this it's it's real rubbery

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.880 
know about this it's it's real rubbery
and<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.659> stretches<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.770> go

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and it stretches a lot and you can go

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
and it stretches a lot and you can go
around<00:01:59.100> corners<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> stuff<00:01:59.820> then<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
around corners and stuff then it's a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.100 
around corners and stuff then it's a
it's<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> 3m<00:02:01.979> fine<00:02:02.399> line<00:02:02.670> masking<00:02:03.149> tape<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.600> think

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's a 3m fine line masking tape I think

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's a 3m fine line masking tape I think
their<00:02:04.229> designation<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
their designation on it

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.940 
their designation on it
is<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:08.110> bigger<00:02:08.380> role<00:02:08.619> will<00:02:08.770> tell<00:02:08.950> us<00:02:09.509> 4:71

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
is this bigger role will tell us 4:71

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
is this bigger role will tell us 4:71
comes<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.040> different<00:02:12.220> widths<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.850> what<00:02:13.690> that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
comes to different widths and what that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690 
comes to different widths and what that
does<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.230> leaves<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.530> nice<00:02:14.680> sharp<00:02:15.100> crisp<00:02:15.430> line

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
does it leaves a nice sharp crisp line

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.460 
does it leaves a nice sharp crisp line
and<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.420> regular<00:02:16.630> masking<00:02:17.110> tape<00:02:17.320> where

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
and not like regular masking tape where

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.620 
and not like regular masking tape where
the<00:02:17.680> paint<00:02:17.980> bleeds<00:02:18.250> under<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.640> salt<00:02:18.970> you'll

then follow your 3m tape with that that
way<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.400> spray<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.209> color<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:53.170> it

excuse<00:03:04.750> me<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> little<00:03:05.080> out<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.290> sequence

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
excuse me I'm a little out of sequence

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.140 
excuse me I'm a little out of sequence
so<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:06.070> worry<00:03:06.160> about<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.520> right<00:03:06.730> now<00:03:06.760> but

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
so don't worry about that right now but

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.600 
so don't worry about that right now but

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
anyway once you get this to all maxed

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.550 
anyway once you get this to all maxed

the<00:03:24.010> next<00:03:24.250> color<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.850> then<00:03:24.940> when<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the next color on and then when that

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.500 
the next color on and then when that
dries<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> little<00:03:25.900> bit<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.440> pull<00:03:26.620> your

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
dries a little bit you can pull your

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.750 
dries a little bit you can pull your
tape<00:03:28.510> off<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:30.220> go<00:03:30.280> ahead<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.430> pull<00:03:30.640> your

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
tape off and then go ahead and pull your

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.040 
tape off and then go ahead and pull your
fine<00:03:31.000> line<00:03:31.239> tape<00:03:31.780> off

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.060 

and<00:03:39.050> then<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.350> wouldn't<00:03:39.530> hurt<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.710> let<00:03:39.890> that

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
and then it wouldn't hurt to let that

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.610 
and then it wouldn't hurt to let that
dry<00:03:40.370> for<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.700> bit<00:03:40.730> maybe<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.540> day<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.560> then

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
dry for a bit maybe a day or so and then

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.080 
dry for a bit maybe a day or so and then

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.860 
can use any kind of a stick on decal
whatever<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.430> just<00:03:52.730> applied<00:03:53.120> these<00:03:53.270> decals<00:03:53.690> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
whatever I just applied these decals to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.810 
whatever I just applied these decals to
the<00:03:54.020> side<00:03:54.170> of<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.350> tank<00:03:54.530> there<00:03:54.770> over<00:03:55.430> over<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
the side of the tank there over over the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.590 
the side of the tank there over over the
top<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.180> blue<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.940> your<00:03:59.300> next<00:03:59.480> step

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
top of the blue and then your next step

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.440 
top of the blue and then your next step
would<00:04:00.260> be<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.410> go<00:04:00.680> ahead<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.070> let<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.670> dry<00:04:01.970> I

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
would be to go ahead and let that dry I

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.000 
would be to go ahead and let that dry I
let<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.720> dry<00:04:02.750> for<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.200> three<00:04:03.620> or<00:04:03.710> four<00:04:03.740> days

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
let it dry for like three or four days

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.830
