00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.490
 revealing the worlds of the coliseum of 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 tangled olympus and twilight way 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.180
 as well as a tournament for ancce in which 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.400
 the magic been in kingdom hearts since 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.050
 the beginning taking its end roots 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.030
 fantasy alone has the ability of a 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
 array of spells like those of fire 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 to heal or gravity though not all 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.239
 the basic spells have been 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.860
 disposition of sora as the low water 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.230
 he can still learn more spells 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.090
 magic in whom to leave 3 the magic has 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 been improved in this trailer we can 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.180
 see that the ability of magic spells 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.460
 which is now can use and that 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.690
 possibly it could be very broad it has 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.340
 shown in entering the 6 type of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.290
 different spells as well as pyro and 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.100
 ice to hero so we'll start with the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.020
 chiro de piro 1 shot the game state 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.610
 mainly in all techno games 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.009
 heart although changing the way 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.720
 use it on what to leave one on 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.310
 ball that goes directly to the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.930
 enemies while on whom to leave 2 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.420
 the fire in returns to circulate while 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.100
 now acting as a protection without 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.660
 however from day 6 and see green 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.030
 also live again make an attack 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.950
 projectile in whom leaving 3 will not be 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.659
 different the spell but it's released to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 through the keyblade and goes straight 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.479
 towards one of the enemies 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 but he seems to be one of the lovers of 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.659
 the spells more geographically 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
 improved with the trail of flames that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.049
 It also leaves behind the pyro shown in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.159
 the game is the most basic form of 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 pyro spells 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.729
 as we level up this magic 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 could become more powerful because yes 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.090
 but throws a fireball but 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.470
 prosperous could launch several good 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.970
 of fire that reached several 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.409
 enemies 2 water the magic of water has not 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.299
 been used by soil in any 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.429
 title of the saga as a basic spell 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.929
 in the world of the school of Olympus we see 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.579
 that those in hearts are surrounded by 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.560
 a water uvi but one of the things 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.330
 more interesting is because one of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.910
 they throw the orb of water to attack 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.890
 to guk and directly something else to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.239
 stand out are the rain clouds up 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.769
 now we have not seen doing anything 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.330
 substantial as now and although there is no 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.400
 been shown could cause some damage 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.260
 about his colleagues for later 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.640
 it could become a rain cloud 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 where you could inflict states 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 altered as poison let's hope that the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.819
 adding water here is not only 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 available for mick's enemies 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.910
 prove that water can be 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.530
 dangerous let's hope that finally I can 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.600
 be used for only 3 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 this command had already been used in that and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.540
 download only but only in mode 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.950
 protection, it's incredible that this 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.050
 spell have the ability to protect 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.190
 and from causing harm he also made his 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.200
 appearance in the game the kingdom hearts 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.360
 wehrwein and which was used by benthos 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.310
 this magic raises all the enemies in 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.020
 the air causing this year at the end the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.209
 Air command could look like others 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.390
 commands like magnet gravity among others 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.489
 4 tornado in the trade we can also 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.380
 see another similar command aerial which 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.970
 is tornado this is the first time 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.830
 Tornado is available as a spell 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.090
 basic and not just as a big attack 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.459
 scope that we have to control 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 ourselves what we really 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.070
 like this spell is its effect that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 has in the game about the middle 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.459
 environment so the air makes it move 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.810
 the grass that's a nice touch of 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.489
 organism that had never been seen in 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.930
 no game the 'Chinese' heart so it's 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.959
 a joy that square enix I am 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 considering 5 electro this magic 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.870
 had always been available in the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.430
 most of the kingdom hearts and that 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 you usually learn as tested 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.730
 magic spell but we had never seen 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.800
 before the detail of the pegasus and from the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.239
 float apparently the keys states in 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.130
 high with hands and will have different 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.780
 powers each of them and in the part 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.519
 detail where we see about struggling with 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.390
 some heartless in twilight villa 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.830
 we can appreciate that the key blade 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.870
 in a carriage with pieces that was going 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.370
 invoking rays around him 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.080
 this means that not only the keys 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.880
 swords could be more powerful in 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.410
 certain magics as was the key 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.209
 sword calling the flame lasso that 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.860
 they excelled pyro but also 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.900
 could make the attacks become a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
 front using different magics as has been 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.910
 seen in the pegasus scene 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.860
 6 ice in this game is no longer 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.930
 connected with training doing it 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.370
 the same technique is right can be 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.080
 one of the main reasons with the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.150
 that you promoted has changed color 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.099
 rose to the area is done 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.959
 blizzard that then proceeds to be used 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.360
 along it like engine lanes 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.400
 brandeis thames and is thrown into the air this 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.500
 jon joyce types trending drop 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.030
 stain where only riki are directed 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.650
 to a lane that he then went to see 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.360
 to jump into the air but it has not been 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.580
 used as a magic spell before 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.020
 the famous one could not be only from 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.669
 ice but there are chances that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.770
 they also use other brands that 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.790
 live with promotion as piro electro 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.290
 among others 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.479
 here ends our informative video 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.889
 about the magic of Kim leaving 3 apparently 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.360

 accustomed but they will also be seen 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.970
