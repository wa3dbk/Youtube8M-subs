00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.600
 hello how about how are I the world and 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.900
 I'm back for the repechage of 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.900
 Red 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.970
 in that time that I had outside the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.490
 program that I take the time to 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.740
 analyze what the court said what 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.720
 The teachers who advised me also 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.520
 I tried to take everything into account 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.930
 out of the program of account that 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.960
 one of the biggest mistakes that had 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.880
 had the nerves that beat me 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.670
 the nerves we can not really what 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.270
 I could give then I'm working 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.800
 in that and take into consideration the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.080
 advice that Daniel gave me that was that 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 he sang in car between mikes 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.970
 Then he told me why you do not do it 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.970
 as well 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.520
 I realized that one was quite 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.280
 appropriate to do it because I could let go 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.750
 I could see the response of the people and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.230
 in fact that see what could be improved 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.940
 I hope that gives me results and that 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.920
 can show and like it comes up loose 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.990
 inside the 2 micro to be loose inside 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.520
 of the stage and being able to give the best of me 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.710
 very well let's hope that that training 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.840
 in the micros you release them already a great 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.570
 presentation step on stage by the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 repechaje the great world song perhaps 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 maybe maybe forward on this night of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.520
 repechaje we present a red fame 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.060
 contrafama 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 already from dictionaries 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.070
 so I ask you when they are very 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.750
 sleep 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.970
 I always answer 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:05.080
 maybe maybe maybe and that's how the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:11.000
 days in I is waiting and you 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:14.090
 answering maybe maybe maybe you're 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.120
 wasting time 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.120
 the thoughts 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 so you go you want 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.360
 how long until when 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:43.040
 if they pass the house and sometimes 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:45.490
 and you answering and maybe maybe 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 maybe 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.420
 do not 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.420
 Y 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.660
 and so the days go by and I 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:20.360
 and you you always answer Perhaps perhaps perhaps 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.360
 you are losing your time 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.500
 two 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.500
 two 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.569
 so more you want 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.620
 until when 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.620
 until when 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.959
 and you are losing this 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 and thinking and thinking 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.930
 so it is not you want ' 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.950
 when 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.950
 until when 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:02.440
 if the days go by that I despair 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.180
