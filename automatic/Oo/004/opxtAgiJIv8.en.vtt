true<00:01:12.360> astonishment<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.290> different<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.579> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
true astonishment is a different is is a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
true astonishment is a different is is a
difference<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.240> different<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> I

difference a very different thing and I
think<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> confusion<00:01:16.649> comes<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> fact

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
think the confusion comes from the fact

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550 
think the confusion comes from the fact
that<00:01:17.939> true<00:01:18.180> astonishment<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.990> originally

right and he lent me Paul's sort of
astonishment<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.269> six

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
astonishment so when I was six

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.450 
astonishment so when I was six
and<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.140> was<00:02:13.290> my<00:02:13.470> introduction<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.040> close-up

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and that was my introduction to close-up

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.760 
and that was my introduction to close-up
magic<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.630> clarity's<00:02:16.590> sake

original books and we're taking a look

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
original books and we're taking a look
at<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.050> plots<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> methods<00:02:35.250> that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
at the the plots and the methods that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670 
at the the plots and the methods that
that<00:02:36.180> are<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.330> important<00:02:37.140> things<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that are really important things that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.260 
that are really important things that
were<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.220> revolutionary<00:02:39.000> at<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.150> time

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
were really revolutionary at the time

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.150 
were really revolutionary at the time
and<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:40.110> looking<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.470> what<00:02:40.770> they<00:02:40.890> turned

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and we're looking at what they turned

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.800 
and we're looking at what they turned
into<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> art<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.000> astonishment<00:02:42.420> books

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
into in the art of astonishment books

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.600 
into in the art of astonishment books
and<00:02:43.200> how<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.710> relates<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> overall

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and how that relates to the overall

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
and how that relates to the overall
picture<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.090> philosophy<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.870> Paul

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
picture and philosophy that Paul

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.440 
picture and philosophy that Paul
developed<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.800> astonishment<00:02:47.490> being<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
developed of astonishment being the the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.230 
developed of astonishment being the the
central<00:02:48.810> focus<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.550> we're<00:02:50.970> hand

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
central focus and so we're hand

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.090 
central focus and so we're hand
selecting<00:02:51.810> certain<00:02:52.170> effects<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.770> effects

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
selecting certain effects and effects

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.400 
selecting certain effects and effects
that<00:02:53.340> meant<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.700> lot<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:54.180> -<00:02:54.570> as<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.960> was<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
that meant a lot to me - as I was you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.750 
that meant a lot to me - as I was you
know<00:02:55.440> performing<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.130> learning<00:02:56.370> close-up

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
know performing and learning close-up

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
know performing and learning close-up
magic<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.410> we're<00:02:58.560> organizing<00:02:58.830> those

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
magic and and we're organizing those

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.250 
magic and and we're organizing those
into<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> series<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.660> series<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:01.080> come

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
into the series and the series will come

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.590 
into the series and the series will come
out<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:02.040> chunks<00:03:02.460> by<00:03:02.700> size<00:03:02.910> -<00:03:03.270> right

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
out you know in chunks by size - right

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
out you know in chunks by size - right
and<00:03:03.990> basically<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> way<00:03:07.350> now

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and basically this is this is a way now

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.280 
and basically this is this is a way now
and<00:03:07.950> productions<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:09.990> Paul

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and productions of this is not a Paul

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.630 
and productions of this is not a Paul
Harris<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:10.740> Paul's<00:03:11.010> given<00:03:11.370> his<00:03:11.520> blessing

Harris but Paul's given his blessing

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.580 
Harris but Paul's given his blessing
he's<00:03:12.300> actually<00:03:12.510> part<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.230> Paul's<00:03:13.440> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
he's actually part of it and Paul's a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.170 
he's actually part of it and Paul's a
huge<00:03:13.800> part<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.250> yeah<00:03:14.370> yeah<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.640> mean<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
huge part of it yeah yeah I mean I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.360 
huge part of it yeah yeah I mean I
couldn't<00:03:15.570> even<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.350> without<00:03:16.920> Paul<00:03:17.220> this

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
couldn't even do this without Paul this

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.460 
couldn't even do this without Paul this
guy<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.880> know<00:03:17.970> right<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.270> yeah<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.320> is

guy you know right right yeah this is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.110 
guy you know right right yeah this is
not<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.370> think<00:03:20.550> that's<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:20.970> an

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
not and I think that's that's an

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.230 
not and I think that's that's an
important<00:03:21.450> point<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.960> not<00:03:21.990> me

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
important point this is not me

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.750 
important point this is not me
you<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.720> doing<00:03:25.350> Paul<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.040> Paul<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.580> all

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you know doing Paul this is Paul if all

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.660 
you know doing Paul this is Paul if all
is<00:03:26.850> very<00:03:27.000> very<00:03:27.510> involved<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.130> core

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
is very very involved in this the core

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the path to astonishment I like to call

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.410 
the path to astonishment I like to call
it<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:46.950> know<00:03:46.980> how<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.310> went<00:03:47.490> from<00:03:47.730> because<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
it you know how it went from because you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.240 
it you know how it went from because you
know<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.690> read<00:03:48.870> his<00:03:48.990> early<00:03:49.230> books<00:03:49.470> his

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
know if you read his early books his

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.120 
know if you read his early books his
humor<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.120> great<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.410> mean<00:03:52.440> reading<00:03:52.890> one

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
humor is so great and I mean reading one

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
humor is so great and I mean reading one
of<00:03:53.220> those<00:03:53.340> books<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.970> performance<00:03:54.480> in

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
of those books is like a performance in

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.590 
of those books is like a performance in
and<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.020> itself<00:03:55.370> there's<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.640> much<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.420> goes

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
and of itself there's so much that goes

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.680 
and of itself there's so much that goes
on<00:03:57.840> great<00:03:58.200> methods<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:58.950> everything<00:03:59.310> but<00:04:00.030> his

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
on great methods and everything but his

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.080 
on great methods and everything but his
early<00:04:01.080> books<00:04:01.290> are<00:04:01.440> very<00:04:01.740> different<00:04:02.130> from<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
early books are very different from the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.840 
early books are very different from the
kind<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.950> magic<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:04.980> he<00:04:05.130> talks<00:04:05.340> about<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.700> art

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
kind of magic that he talks about in art

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.610 
kind of magic that he talks about in art
of<00:04:05.940> astonishment<00:04:06.360> right<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.290> sense<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
of astonishment right in the sense that

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.400 
of astonishment right in the sense that
he<00:04:07.950> hadn't<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.670> developed<00:04:09.210> that<00:04:09.510> theory

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
he hadn't really developed that theory

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.470 
he hadn't really developed that theory
the<00:04:10.800> philosophy<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> astonishment<00:04:12.060> at<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
the philosophy of astonishment at that

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.430 
the philosophy of astonishment at that
point<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.780> time<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.140> what<00:04:13.260> we're<00:04:13.410> really

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
point in time and what we're really

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.470 
point in time and what we're really
interested<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.280> how<00:04:14.460> that<00:04:14.820> developed<00:04:15.360> and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
interested in is how that developed and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.110 
interested in is how that developed and
evolved<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.200> -<00:04:16.620> what<00:04:16.770> it<00:04:16.890> is<00:04:17.070> yeah<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.970> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
evolved to - what it is yeah and the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.729 
evolved to - what it is yeah and the
important<00:04:18.510> thing<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.690> understand<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.590> these

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
important thing to understand on these

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.060 
important thing to understand on these
though<00:04:19.950> -<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:22.350> know<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.530> talk<00:04:22.800> about

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
on astonishment arguably could be said

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.660 
on astonishment arguably could be said
to<00:04:36.630> be<00:04:36.660> one<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.620> things<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.580> really

the material it's just kind of
incredible<00:07:19.500> in<00:07:19.830> one<00:07:20.070> last<00:07:20.400> question<00:07:20.790> about

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
incredible in one last question about

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.600 
incredible in one last question about
this<00:07:21.240> how<00:07:21.990> you<00:07:22.680> know<00:07:22.800> not<00:07:22.950> to<00:07:23.100> hold<00:07:23.280> you<00:07:23.400> to<00:07:23.580> it

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
this how you know not to hold you to it

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.370 
this how you know not to hold you to it
but<00:07:23.910> obviously<00:07:24.600> you're<00:07:24.780> breaking<00:07:25.170> this<00:07:25.320> up

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
but obviously you're breaking this up

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.500 
but obviously you're breaking this up
and<00:07:25.830> kind<00:07:26.100> of<00:07:26.160> having<00:07:26.610> a<00:07:26.730> command<00:07:27.060> bite-sized

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
and kind of having a command bite-sized

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.150 
and kind of having a command bite-sized
chunks<00:07:27.810> about<00:07:28.050> how<00:07:28.170> often<00:07:28.500> are<00:07:28.620> we<00:07:28.710> gonna<00:07:28.890> be

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
chunks about how often are we gonna be

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.760 
chunks about how often are we gonna be
seeing<00:07:29.580> these<00:07:29.790> we're<00:07:30.390> shooting<00:07:30.780> for<00:07:31.080> you<00:07:31.650> know

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
seeing these we're shooting for you know

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.770 
seeing these we're shooting for you know
every<00:07:32.010> you<00:07:32.520> know<00:07:32.550> what<00:07:32.820> a<00:07:32.850> volume<00:07:33.330> every<00:07:33.570> three

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 
every you know what a volume every three

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.810 
every you know what a volume every three
to<00:07:33.870> four<00:07:34.050> months<00:07:34.260> or<00:07:34.860> so<00:07:35.160> is<00:07:35.220> kind<00:07:35.670> of<00:07:35.700> the

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
to four months or so is kind of the

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.760 
to four months or so is kind of the
timeline<00:07:36.180> we're<00:07:36.360> looking<00:07:36.630> we're<00:07:37.350> looking<00:07:37.620> at

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
timeline we're looking we're looking at

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.170 
timeline we're looking we're looking at
and<00:07:38.040> that<00:07:38.550> was<00:07:38.670> one<00:07:38.790> of<00:07:38.850> the<00:07:38.940> things<00:07:39.000> we

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
and that was one of the things we

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.820 
and that was one of the things we
discussed<00:07:39.570> you<00:07:39.870> know<00:07:39.960> was<00:07:40.200> should<00:07:40.440> we<00:07:40.470> do<00:07:40.710> it

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830 
discussed you know was should we do it

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.830 
discussed you know was should we do it
all<00:07:40.950> at<00:07:41.100> once<00:07:41.280> and<00:07:41.580> have<00:07:41.700> a<00:07:41.940> big<00:07:42.180> set<00:07:42.450> come<00:07:42.660> out

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 
all at once and have a big set come out

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.960 
all at once and have a big set come out
and<00:07:43.710> true<00:07:43.890> astonishment<00:07:44.310> obviously<00:07:44.820> did

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
and true astonishment obviously did

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.520 
and true astonishment obviously did
incredibly<00:07:45.450> well

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530 
incredibly well

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.710 
incredibly well
but<00:07:47.160> I<00:07:47.400> think<00:07:47.940> it's<00:07:48.060> important<00:07:48.480> for<00:07:48.510> us<00:07:48.630> to

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
but I think it's important for us to

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.230 
but I think it's important for us to
kind<00:07:48.960> of<00:07:49.080> take<00:07:49.140> the<00:07:49.800> viewers<00:07:50.160> down<00:07:50.730> that<00:07:50.970> path

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 
kind of take the viewers down that path

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.090 
kind of take the viewers down that path
that<00:07:51.600> I<00:07:51.750> talked<00:07:52.050> about<00:07:52.140> right<00:07:52.590> and<00:07:52.770> to

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.100 
that I talked about right and to

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.800 
that I talked about right and to
illustrate<00:07:53.250> that<00:07:53.700> I<00:07:53.760> think<00:07:54.180> in<00:07:54.300> order<00:07:54.420> to<00:07:54.570> do

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
illustrate that I think in order to do

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.510 
illustrate that I think in order to do
that<00:07:54.990> we're<00:07:55.800> gonna<00:07:55.860> want<00:07:56.100> to<00:07:56.220> take<00:07:56.310> our<00:07:56.490> time

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
that we're gonna want to take our time

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.070 
that we're gonna want to take our time
with<00:07:56.910> production<00:07:57.300> and<00:07:57.540> make<00:07:57.690> sure<00:07:57.840> we<00:07:57.960> do

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
with production and make sure we do

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.620 
with production and make sure we do
everything<00:07:58.110> right<00:07:58.500> along<00:07:58.950> the<00:07:59.100> way<00:07:59.250> so<00:07:59.940> so<00:08:00.510> it
