00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.110
 Sake is an expert to be 10 days today 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.170
 The second day's course is about the creation of Japanese history 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.660
 1000 pieces of polished rice today 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.080
 I will talk about relative worms 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.690
 Although I was allowed to speak in yesterday's course 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:33.140
 Sake takes a rare and complicated process in the world 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 Also have a significant impact on one by one liquor can work 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 Starting with processing of raw materials such as 1000 sheets of rice 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:52.390
 In the work of micro-organisms say that justice-ku, grain-making charge 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 Followed by the adjustment immediately before shipment to care about any time of the day or night 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:05.680
 By knowing sake, you can see the spirit of sake breweries 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.000
 Also, knowing it will deepen the taste of sake 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.060
 Sake will go has been made by such a flow 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 General marketed to Honshu 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 I will be happy to tell you to make together 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.180
 The start of sake making starts with polishing brown rice to white rice 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.980
 This is called milling 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:37.080
 There are a lot of proteins and lipids that are the negative part of the production on the outside of rice 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.710
 We will do milling for that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:49.780
 Called the rice commission what's called how much was polished rice 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:51.420
 In general, the version My that we usually eat is about 90% to 92% of milled rice 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.830
 It is a commission 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:02.170
 Or sake is 60% Toka 70% and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:04.060
 It becomes 50% to 30% milling rate when it becomes Ginjo 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.280
 Then with the milled rice rate 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.850
 I left brown rice and left 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.460
 It refers to a representation of white rice as a percentage 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.250
 For example , saying that 70% of the rice milling rate 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.550
 3 floor machine polished 30% surface 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.560
 Says those remaining 70% of the rice 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:34.989
 Low milling rate 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 It will be a liquor with less miscellaneous taste and a clear taste Conversely it is complex and rich with high milled rice bran 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.050
 It will be a drink of flavor 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.880
 Enter the continuation 1,000 relatives in rice 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:53.470
 We wash rice and let rice rice water 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:57.040
 It may seem like a very simple task, but highly milled rice is easy to break water 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.040
 Sucking speed is fast for that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.970
 Ideal to manage relative time in seconds 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 Will control so that the absorption rate 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.140
 Then go into the bug 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:18.930
 Steam using this old-fashioned tool 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.920
 Rice used for sake is hard on the outside and soft on the inside 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.130
 I will not cook but ignore 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:33.180
 When the six sisters are hard, they are easy to loosen when making a porridge 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.750
 It will be easier to adjust the speed of melting the eyelids before the application 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:43.110
 In addition, if the inside is soft, rice bran 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 The ban on bacilli can be easily extended to the inside of rice in 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.300
 6 done rice is under construction 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.620
 It is used for the application before 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.840
 Rice processing of the steps we are allowed to your story today 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:04.650
 Has a major impact on the main room 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:08.580
 In particular, pure rice sure pure rice gin gin will be an especially important process 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.040
 How is today's course to here? 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.760
 Thank you 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.699
 Let 'I do tomorrow 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.699
