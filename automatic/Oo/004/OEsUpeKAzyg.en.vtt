was a beautiful look but when I went to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
it didn't record correctly and it was

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.579 
it didn't record correctly and it was
skipping<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:46.510> was<00:00:46.600> just<00:00:46.780> an<00:00:46.870> entire<00:00:47.260> mess

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.140 
and I just rub that in till I got the
desired<00:04:24.389> intensity<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.820> using<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.880> brush<00:04:27.090> like

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
desired intensity and using a brush like

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.420

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
deep dark color it's going to really

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.710

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.200 
going to show off the eyeball itself and
really<00:05:19.410> make<00:05:19.560> them<00:05:19.740> stand<00:05:20.040> out<00:05:20.220> so<00:05:20.820> all<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.060> did

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
really make them stand out so all I did

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.810 
really make them stand out so all I did
was<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.199> see<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.650> deeper<00:05:23.160> color<00:05:23.430> just

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
was you can see that deeper color just

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.909 
was you can see that deeper color just
place<00:05:24.090> right<00:05:24.510> here<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.199> packed<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:25.770> on

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
place right here and I packed it on

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.310 
place right here and I packed it on
first<00:05:26.220> right<00:05:26.729> into<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.120> outer<00:05:27.389> B's<00:05:27.720> simply

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
first right into this outer B's simply

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.550 
first right into this outer B's simply
like<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.919> drawing<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:30.030> sort<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.330> shape<00:05:30.600> so

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
like that drawing that sort of shape so

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.620 
like that drawing that sort of shape so
the<00:05:32.040> most<00:05:32.250> color<00:05:32.699> intensity<00:05:33.090> was<00:05:33.330> right<00:05:33.540> on

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
the most color intensity was right on

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.170 
the most color intensity was right on
this<00:05:33.750> outer<00:05:33.990> V<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.530> then<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.770> gently<00:05:35.280> brought

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
this outer V and then I gently brought

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.540 
this outer V and then I gently brought
it<00:05:36.360> in<00:05:36.510> like<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.860> creates<00:05:38.340> that

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
it in like this so it creates that

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.490 
it in like this so it creates that
shadow<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.270> your<00:05:39.419> crease<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:40.020> really<00:05:40.260> nice

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
shape the final I shadow step was to

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:55.550 
shape the final I shadow step was to
take<00:05:47.210> this<00:05:48.210> really<00:05:48.870> shimmery<00:05:54.110> lilac<00:05:55.110> color

really really nice I always recommend

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.200 
really really nice I always recommend
kind<00:06:26.010> of<00:06:26.099> finding<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.430> way<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.550> tie<00:06:26.880> in<00:06:26.940> your

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
kind of finding a way to tie in your

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.159 
kind of finding a way to tie in your
highlight<00:06:27.539> with<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.780> rest<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.050> your

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
highlight with the rest of your

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.529 
highlight with the rest of your
eyeshadow<00:06:28.530> look<00:06:28.740> it<00:06:29.160> may<00:06:29.550> be<00:06:29.610> subtle<00:06:30.210> but<00:06:30.450> it

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
eyeshadow look it may be subtle but it

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.300 
eyeshadow look it may be subtle but it
does<00:06:30.720> make<00:06:30.960> a<00:06:31.020> difference<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.680> it<00:06:31.740> seems<00:06:32.010> just

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
does make a difference and it seems just

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.779 
does make a difference and it seems just
pull<00:06:32.550> everything<00:06:32.910> together<00:06:33.270> to<00:06:34.520> finish<00:06:35.520> off

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
pull everything together to finish off

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.409 
pull everything together to finish off
