one<00:00:01.620> of<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.740> questions<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.220> get<00:00:02.370> asked<00:00:02.639> about<00:00:02.730> a

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
one of the questions I get asked about a

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.300 
one of the questions I get asked about a
lot<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.929> block<00:00:04.230> convex<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.160> concave

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
lot is how to block convex and concave

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.519 
lot is how to block convex and concave
surfaces<00:00:06.150> here's<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.600> couple<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.960> tips

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
surfaces here's a couple of tips

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.650 
surfaces here's a couple of tips
I<00:00:07.560> love<00:00:08.460> these<00:00:08.610> dura<00:00:08.820> blocks<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.300> reach<00:00:09.450> for

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
I love these dura blocks I reach for

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.890 
I love these dura blocks I reach for
them<00:00:09.780> every<00:00:10.019> time<00:00:10.260> they're<00:00:10.920> flexible<00:00:11.719> push<00:00:12.719> on

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
them every time they're flexible push on

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.379 
them every time they're flexible push on
each<00:00:12.929> end<00:00:13.349> contours<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> surface<00:00:14.790> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
each end contours to the surface you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.390 
each end contours to the surface you
want<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.780> make<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.230> X<00:00:16.440> pattern<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.220> want

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
want to make an X pattern and you want

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.050 
want to make an X pattern and you want
to<00:00:17.490> roll<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.880> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
to roll with it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
to roll with it
by<00:00:18.420> rolling<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.080> mean<00:00:19.109> travel<00:00:26.269> lights

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
by rolling with it I mean travel lights

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.839 
by rolling with it I mean travel lights

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.920 

see<00:00:42.800> how<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.039> is<00:00:43.100> working<00:00:43.519> out<00:00:43.640> light<00:00:44.570> spots

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
see how this is working out light spots

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.680 
see how this is working out light spots
high<00:00:45.469> spots<00:00:45.859> dark<00:00:46.250> spots<00:00:46.579> low<00:00:46.850> spots<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:47.539> is

high spots dark spots low spots this is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.349 
high spots dark spots low spots this is
an<00:00:47.839> excellent<00:00:48.260> reveal<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:49.190> what's<00:00:49.909> happening

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
an excellent reveal of what's happening

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.380 
an excellent reveal of what's happening
with<00:00:50.479> my<00:00:50.600> panel<00:00:50.839> it's<00:00:51.019> indirect<00:00:51.379> reflection

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
with my panel it's indirect reflection

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.520 
with my panel it's indirect reflection
obviously<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.420> can't<00:00:53.690> take<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.989> giant<00:00:54.320> block

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
obviously I can't take the giant block

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.380 
obviously I can't take the giant block
and<00:00:54.829> go<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.039> here<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:55.430> not<00:00:55.550> flat<00:00:55.879> it's<00:00:56.180> dipped

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and go in here it's not flat it's dipped

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.810 
and go in here it's not flat it's dipped
in<00:00:56.570> like<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.920> reached<00:00:58.280> for<00:00:58.369> my<00:00:58.460> round

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
in like this so I reached for my round

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.759 
in like this so I reached for my round
block<00:00:59.420> now<00:00:59.659> you<00:00:59.719> can<00:00:59.899> substitute<00:01:00.289> these<00:01:00.559> with

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
block now you can substitute these with

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.590 
block now you can substitute these with
the<00:01:00.829> radiator<00:01:01.159> hose<00:01:01.280> even<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.149> piece<00:01:02.299> of<00:01:02.449> PVC

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the radiator hose even a piece of PVC

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.389 
the radiator hose even a piece of PVC
tubing<00:01:03.289> I<00:01:03.469> like<00:01:03.769> these<00:01:03.920> because<00:01:04.129> they're

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
tubing I like these because they're

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.580 
tubing I like these because they're
flexible<00:01:04.580> what<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.420> want<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.659> do<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:06.200> roll

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
flexible what you want to do is roll

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.100 
flexible what you want to do is roll
this<00:01:06.799> baby<00:01:07.100> while<00:01:07.729> you're<00:01:07.970> traveling<00:01:08.539> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
this baby while you're traveling you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.249 
this baby while you're traveling you
want<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.470> one<00:01:09.649> of<00:01:09.680> these<00:01:16.929> right<00:01:17.929> here<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.229> a

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
want to do one of these right here is a

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.899 
want to do one of these right here is a
perfect<00:01:18.740> example<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:19.280> what's<00:01:19.490> happening

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
perfect example of what's happening

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.669 
perfect example of what's happening
we're<00:01:20.240> trying<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.659> read<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.050> surface<00:01:21.500> and

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
we're trying to read the surface and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.710 
we're trying to read the surface and
reshape<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.090> telling<00:01:23.390> me<00:01:23.450> I've<00:01:23.569> got<00:01:23.690> a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
reshape it this is telling me I've got a

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.630 
reshape it this is telling me I've got a
little<00:01:23.929> more<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.319> do<00:01:24.440> here<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.039> dark<00:01:25.399> which

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
little more to do here it's dark which

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.130 
little more to do here it's dark which
means<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.149> surface<00:01:26.360> hasn't<00:01:26.810> been<00:01:26.929> broken

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
means the surface hasn't been broken

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.380 
means the surface hasn't been broken
this<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.100> surface<00:01:28.460> has<00:01:28.640> been<00:01:28.850> broken<00:01:29.090> it's

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
this the surface has been broken it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.779 
this the surface has been broken it's
light<00:01:29.630> it's<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.319> guide<00:01:30.560> coat<00:01:30.860> built<00:01:31.429> into<00:01:31.670> the

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
light it's a guide coat built into the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.870 
light it's a guide coat built into the
primer<00:01:32.030> beautiful<00:01:32.569> thing<00:01:36.520> okay<00:01:37.520> I've<00:01:37.700> got<00:01:37.850> a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.080 

and<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.740> getting<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.250> edge<00:01:56.579> I'm

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and I'm not getting into this edge I'm

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.370 
and I'm not getting into this edge I'm
just<00:01:57.270> dealing<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.750> pink<00:01:58.020> edge<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.619> a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
just dealing with my pink edge here a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
just dealing with my pink edge here a
combination<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> couple<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.950> pieces<00:02:02.159> think

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
combination of a couple of pieces think

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.620 
combination of a couple of pieces think
it<00:02:03.149> through

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it through

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
it through
you'll<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:03.990> there
