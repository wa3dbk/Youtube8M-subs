00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 help with a little tutorial on 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 quite easy reality but that many 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.610
 people are wondering or have they 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.840
 asked 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.150
 about the application there are photos that we 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.240
 help organize all our photos 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.660
 in marc the photos that we transferred from 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.630
 iphone or from some device and the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.340
 We can sort by events by we can 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.720
 create albums and transfer them 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.720
 directly from the club 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.239
 but the question is where you want 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.329
 saved the original file that we have 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.949
 transferred to our hard drive which 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.590
 can help us later to transfer it 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.199
 some pendrive or some hard disk 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.220
 external and be able to share the photo 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.250
 if we go straight to the end 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.970
 and the option of images appears in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.150
 iphoto free 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.840
 but by double clicking it directs us 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.079
 back to iphoto 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.110
 then what we should do is click 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.500
 right and show package contents 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.020
 by clicking here we can open the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.360
 iphoto folder where they are 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.980
 all the files and we're headed 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.430
 directly to masters and this is where 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:47.090
 the files are sorted by date or be 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.610
 the folder 2014 the month 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.910
 August or 08 and order it by days 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.280
 if we click here they are sorted by 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.460
 files and this is where all the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 photo files jpg files by 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.390
 example while doing quiet save 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.670
 all the photos that were in the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 event that I have open to fit there 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.170
 Photos 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.580
 and from here we can copy the files 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.069
 can share it delete or copy or 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.680
 duplicate and so on 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.780
 another simpler way also what 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.859
 we can do directly from this there 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.950
 photo click on the file 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.380
 that we want to open and we go to 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.650
 archive 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.490
 show in the finder and original file 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.730
 and direct us to the folder 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.680
 where the photo is but as 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.070
 jpg file 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.440
 a pretty easy tutorial but very 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.620
 practical and that many people have 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.620
 asked 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.090
 that would be for today and if they have more 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.490
 queries or suggestions write it in 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.800
 the comments below and I'll be attentive to 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.800
 the answers until then friends
