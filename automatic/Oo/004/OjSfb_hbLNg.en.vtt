00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.109
 and that is the newest member of the 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.019
 sonos boxing family of the play family 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.519
 here the playon or play 1 you see her 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.180
 is relatively small but heavy 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.949
 she does not have many 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.400
 You can connect here 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.740
 behind 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.810
 only a LAN cable directly 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.130
 connect 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.430
 this is the support for the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.039
 box so there is no linen and she has 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.390
 down here the electricity very nice 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.809
 processed very valuable, everything feels 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.860
 on 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.190
 on top of it you only have the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 pause and play button and the loud quietly 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.780
 button and this little light led that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.829
 book club is relatively heavy 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:02.710
 So you should not think that's the way it is 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:05.010
 weighs a lot as you can see it has just 19 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.010
 kilo 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.730
 it's basically just a bit 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 bigger than a big tin can 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.750
 Almost everywhere is a mono vox 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.800
 radiates all around but I have to say 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 I was very surprised by the sound 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.230
 convinced me for such a look 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.600
 my quotes movie small 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.500
 loudspeaker is already quite nice 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.410
 big out very nicely done I think 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.369
 on the connection for the current I can 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 put it in the bottom 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.190
 and as you can see it is closing smoothly 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 down here you have no cable what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.310
 stands somewhere and stands happy 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.150
 and the cable is also pretty long in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.910
 the box of the carton is still too 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.690
 a lan cable with it 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.070
 what you do it directly on the router 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 could connect as I said that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.820
 your router in the room brew this 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.030
 small box and would like to connect 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.470
 you do not need an additional bridge 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.519
 then this speaker acts as it were 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.870
 as a transmitter setting up here 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.940
 again, you just load yourself 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 Either the app for smartphones below 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:33.989
 whether android or ios or you are charging 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.950
 you the app on the pc and as I said 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.920
 they are already with me 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.180
 set up the boxes 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.340
 I show you only times it probably her 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.050
 if you have not installed anything yet 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.880
 then this comes automatically 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.769
 installation program if you want to 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.000
 example the new new speaker 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.140
 want to add it to their 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.470
 Add settings to 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.620
 he starts to look up here 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 these two buttons briefly at the same time 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.920
 and he is already connected at the first 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 sometimes it takes a bit longer 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.820
 Of course and you can name one 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.920
 to assign 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.910
 he's usually with me 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.860
 bathroom 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.080
 you could still be in the room 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.520
 a position for example the equalizer 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.650
 change that at the moment actually 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.330
 only bass and and and heights and depths 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.380
 are 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.510
 I'll fit you down a bit 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.430
 because there is quite a bit in there and 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.570
 you can switch loud, I know 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.080
 not if you have to someday, too 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.610
 already planning more presets 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.310
 to do as for example go as of 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.390
 itunes knows or you can do that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.180
 Change call name 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.540
 you can now say the led up above 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.890
 can be on or off if you two 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.660
 which you could have in here 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.850
 create stereo couple because of this small 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.210
 guy is and I also very successful 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.340
 So you can spotify account app store 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.100
 add account you have access to 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
 over 100,000 radio stations 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.940
 internet radio stations worldwide 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.380
 you can use your music library 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.460
 add and and and so it really is 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.350
 very very easy 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.100
 these things in your network 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.239
 to integrate the sound is great so 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.000
 there is nothing to shake I have 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.680
 still the sonos play 5 for the kitchen where 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 I used to have a bose sound click 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.919
 says doc had 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 and I have to say that sounded like that 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.400
 I like play five a lot better 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.530
 as of the bose sounddock i have to 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.030
 unfortunately I say I have a bad attitude too 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.980
 sounddock first generation gave 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.460
 Maybe a lot has happened there 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.410
 meanwhile, however, I am of the opinion there 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.200
 so sonos is really up 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.230
 the same height in terms of sound in this 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.910
 system 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.030
 My conclusion is I can the pr 1 absolutely 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.180
 recommend has a great sound 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.530
 also really good bass in it 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.800
 if you have two of them you can the 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.030
 You can pair it in the stereo park 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.620
 whole apartment in principle as 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.300
 as a sound system switch or each 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.909
 Room individually switch each room individually 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.819
 turn it off silently or turn it off 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.349
 just let everything run together 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.159
 I think a little too bad personally 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:28.020
 that there is no possibility these days 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.060
 has that turn off the box completely so 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.520
 she is always synonymous if you make her 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.349
 in standby mode always something is related 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.759
 Strom I can not say how much that 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.710
 I can now also the box here 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:44.360
 turn it over again 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.689
 she starts there again or in that 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.460
 sender or in the playlist you as 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.020
 last played and you can 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.699
 The box also loud and quiet switch 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.490
 directly vis the only thing really me 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.139
 Bothers you is no possibility you 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.300
 completely turn off then would have to 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.650
 disconnect them from the electricity and turn them on again 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.939
 one holds a connector strip one man 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.919
 others can turn off 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.340
 because I think today is not 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.569
 more necessary that something permanent in the 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.330
 standby operation is that's actually 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.520
 The only thing I like about this box 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.889
 disturbs otherwise I find very successful 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.750
 both the sound and the designer 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.969
 and the processing is done 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.240
 really as a very very good and 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.979
 High quality impression 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.810
 and i could give you the little guy 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.259
 This little ravioli cans really 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.370
 Also recommend a small video 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.419
 you liked a bit 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.419
 Until next time
