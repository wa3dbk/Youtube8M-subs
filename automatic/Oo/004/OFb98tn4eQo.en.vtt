the<00:01:50.350> soul<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.860> dry<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.119> okay<00:01:52.420> for<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.720> to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the soul is dry and it's okay for it to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440 
the soul is dry and it's okay for it to
be<00:01:52.930> drive<00:01:53.170> because<00:01:53.440> most<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.010> herbs<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
be drive because most of the herbs you

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.359 
be drive because most of the herbs you
have<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.720> control<00:01:56.080> their<00:01:56.290> drainage<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.009> water

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
drainage needs to be controlled so

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.960 
drainage needs to be controlled so
that's<00:01:59.560> why<00:01:59.740> it's<00:02:00.009> not<00:02:00.070> wet<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.670> anything
