 akasa done on april 2014 wto 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 Marzak launched on launched 4g mobile 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.660
 Internet from the company megaphone speed 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 mobile 4g ​​internet megaphone 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 about 15 20 do not feed where you are 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 hour we can go and check and texts 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 mazak now about getting mean us 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 almost 30 megabits per second here before 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840
 what we now know how much will 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.980
 broadcast 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 gear 12 here is the inhuman speed 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:49.829
 29 only dobby when second and transfer 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 1209 his friends my name is raisa 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 now we want to check the speed 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.210
 mobile internet from megaphone to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.749
 various devices and here on this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 device 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:05.299
 4g is connected and the Internet is on 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.820
 these wi-fi connected 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.149
 4 is let for four as there are three 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 same 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.310
 and laptop 4 via modem so we 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310
 at the same time 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 so four immediately flew my same 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.290
 look good 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.290
 eleven 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.170
 everyone will hear 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.619
 so look 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.420
 for what you. 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 this 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 Eliseev by us 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.340
 well look now what is interesting to do 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.200
 now we had alpha technology and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.099
 router for only know one to us is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.690
 described somewhat the highest speed 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.069
 There were four after the same model 23 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:26.840
 mean megabit per second 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:30.220
 which means through the tablet showed 10 means 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.989
 Wi-Fi modem showed 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:39.730
 10-12 say erect means 3 same 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.549
 showed your 78 here is such different data 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.160
 Now we will try through wi-fi 4g 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.270
 run some video on youtube 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.770
 channel 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.770
 so my added or had time here 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.990
 everything is very fast everything is very 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.380
 good to know is important to a friend 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.380
 not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.120
 don't know 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.150
 humbled to damage 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.150
 but 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840
 these pendants 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.750
 finite 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.930
 personalities 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.409
 all shows very quickly and very 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.409
 OK 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.480
 which one here 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.930
 now we run one get 4 same and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:09.330
 we can increase speed 29 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:16.260
 Type such a run just through if 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:18.049
 the fact that through the curtain the device from 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.269
 the speed should be lower in theory 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.269
 so still see 10 people of his 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:35.850
 1238 yes here you can see that the speed 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.100
 below we got 18 clear 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.820
 several devices cost and now 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.730
 mentally try 3g 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:50.330
 yes it means it will try clean through 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:54.750
 the tablet is clean like 99 5g yes through 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.620
 changes here should be 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.710
 Probably somewhere to study will be released 7 rates 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.340
 old gives but put catalpa it 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.340
 already like 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.199
 isn't that so getting on here 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.610
 about 4 391 mega view second and transfer 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:22.120
 we have a transfer of 031 hours 30 thousand from work 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.120
