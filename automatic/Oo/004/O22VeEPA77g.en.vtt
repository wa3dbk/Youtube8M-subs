00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:13.049
 lousy pretty all guys this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.759
 among those who speak to you today I am here with a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 video showing you ten things that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 maybe you didn't know about clash of clans ci 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.840
 I want to clarify two things before the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 fast video starts fast the first is that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
 it took me so long 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 commitment and desire to achieve 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 this video so please leave 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 a nice thumb on a nice comment 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 and maybe share or add i 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 favorite my video if the video doesn't 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.460
 I liked them please leave also 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 a dislike as many are welcome 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 but above all i 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.239
 constructive comments that help me 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 improve in the videos I make in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.420
 future, second thing I wanted to wish you 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 a good vision 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.160
 and I hope you enjoy the video 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 if you go to the single player map 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.059
 of clash of play and get off a little 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 low you will find the defense campaign 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.559
 Sicilian and I come back and obsidian between 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.350
 these two campaigns on the map on 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.420
 background that in ocher color we find 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.780
 a figure of a barbarian king who supports 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.450
 a mug of beer raised the only one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.420
 reason that eyes I found is that the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 supercells of Finnish origin and how 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 we all know in these places in these 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.390
 Nordic places the culture of beer is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.100
 very widespread and therefore probably 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.520
 the insertion of this image is a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 tribute, however, a reference in fact 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.150
 to the place of birth of this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.150
 incredible game 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.740
 if you go to the global clash chart 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 of france and write this word rape 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 you will be censored the reason is simple 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 in fact the creator of the clash of plants 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 it was laws with the turnips he wanted in a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.060
 a certain sense to eliminate from the game 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.909
 of course I'm joking because 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.979
 the word derives from English and in 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.040
 English is precisely pronounced tape 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 which means rape is a word 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.900
 vulgarity that they did not want to include 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.330
 in the game precisely because its 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.030
 nature is to be a word 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 scurrilous 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.540
 if you go to the normal barracks and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.230
 select the information of the split 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.150
 Wall 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.910
 you can zoom in on the bomb it holds in 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.920
 hand if you pay close attention you might 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.170
 notice that drawn or otherwise 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.630
 there are features on the bomb 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.680
 hence the continents of our planet 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 we can precisely observe the Earth 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 oceans etc. naturally remains a 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.800
 mystery why 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.150
 clash the super sale wanted 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.890
 insert inside the bomb of the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.890
 smashes the planet earth 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.600
 if you go in the clan search and search 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:54.030
 the clan with the tag name hashtag 2888 para 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.860
 a clan named hole will be presented 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.510
 ron es 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.760
 presumably Argentine Spanish 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.120
 within which there are three 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.209
 heads as you can see from 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.410
 images there are three heads and the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.900
 motivation is simple 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.010
 at the beginning of cache of grace when i 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.950
 An ambient oven clown was possible 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.060
 let's say determine three different heads 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 inside the club 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 so this makes us understand that the clan 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.070
 in question is very very old 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.380
 if you go to the player campaign 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.390
 single and select the valley mission 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 of the rat you realize that at the top a 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.250
 right there is a small tomb of those 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.200
 that appear when of your defenses 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.680
 he followed an enemy attack 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.330
 therefore defeated the enemy units if 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.250
 Do you want to be placed by any troop of 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.080
 earth near this core tomb 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.230
 gete that appears just like a real one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.420
 bomb of the ones you have that we have 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.000
 in our villages a pumpkin appears 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.220
 yellow halloween that will blow up the area 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.590
 in quotation marks your troops 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.360
 naturally, the damage it does is little 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.330
 high but still 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.750
 It is interesting to know this the appearance 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.720
 of this easter egg we tried a 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.980
 clan via the tag name and type 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:21.060
 hashtag 8 j 9 of 280 g will search for a 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.030
 club called ten-time time 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.260
 where there are ten members all are co 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.600
 leaders apart from one who is the boss and all 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.660
 these members have the same level 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.540
 and not only do they also have the same 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.880
 identical village then the same 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.130
 disposition and in a sense only 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 even in the same league anyway 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.490
 the intent would be that many are being 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.310
 asking how come there is a clan 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.560
 of people who decided to do something 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.810
 some believe that it is a 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.580
 however, the clan of illuminati remains 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.230
 something quite mysterious and there 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.669
 I really urge you to take a look at 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.669
 this strange clan 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.510
 if in your village you drag the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.640
 town hall in one of the corners of the 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.640
 map de conge network that defended as 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.820
 cannon mortars and hicks bows tend to 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.580
 turn to the opposite side to where 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.830
 you have placed the town hall a lot 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.630
 curious I honestly cannot explain myself 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.490
 neither did I, however, because it was one 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.800
 curiosity that I wanted to share with you 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.700
 also tell me below in the comments what 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.960
 think of it 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.390
 enel because of this thing you save in 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.910
 single player map and select the 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.590
 Goblin picnic campaign you notice 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.090
 that at the bottom right is the statue of 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.100
 sin surrounded by walls 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.440
 if you take a passion jump into 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.260
 taken right above the statue and after 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.970
 what are your heroes doing? 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.520
 inside and then outside of it 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.620
 of this square of walls you notice 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.000
 that appears a red smoke that will give 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.640
 the signal to the Santa's sleigh 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.720
 that passing over the map will scan from 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.220
 explosive packages 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.350
 this is a memory of the saint 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.720
 claus leather which was a potion that is 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.169
 was introduced long ago I believe the 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.819
 first year in which clash of place 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.499
 has been marketed and that 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.779
 it worked like lightning only that 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:17.150
 I had the effect much more powerful but 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.740
 even more charging times as much 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.639
 to remain enlightened or 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.080
 mysteries 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.659
 if we take a closer look at the 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.120
 level 4 mortal cane that 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.979
 we can notice that painted or engraved 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.439
 on the latter which has a sort of 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.199
 eye the eye remembers and not a little 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.539
 the one that appears in the symbol in the 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.879
 famous triangle of the illuminati e 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:41.389
 so there could be a reference 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:44.870
 to this mysterious sect and tell me you 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.759
 what you think below is possible 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.740
 place a strip of potions by 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.539
 jump over a mass of walls to do 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.120
 so that your troops succeed in 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.099
 skip the obstacle rather than skip the 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.960
 suitable term would be to fly or 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.999
 fly over as we see from 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.430
 this video made by gozzo that is 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:05.539
 one of the main youtuber of cles al 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.400
 world troops tend to fly over 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.870
 within the walls and thus reaching the 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.939
 defenses on the other side is one thing 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.439
 particular enough that many of you 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.439
 probably have never seen 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.810
 the video is finished I hope there is 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.880
 I really hope you enjoy it 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.170
 left a nice thumb up I invite you to 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.150
 take a look at the video on how

 detailed and very very clear and in

 secondly, I invite you to see also 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.320
 my video 20 things that maybe don't make sense

 clash of place which was the first episode 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.210
 of this in series quotes
