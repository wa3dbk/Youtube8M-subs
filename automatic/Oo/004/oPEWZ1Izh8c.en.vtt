clean sleek wood from the outside but
the<00:01:36.360> amount<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.659> space<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
this but what's most important is the
cavity<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.439> driver<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
cavity that's in there for the driver is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
cavity that's in there for the driver is
large<00:01:44.820> you've<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.360> large<00:01:45.600> drivers<00:01:46.079> very<00:01:46.500> very

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
large you've got large drivers very very

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.920 
large you've got large drivers very very
high<00:01:46.920> quality<00:01:47.220> sound<00:01:47.610> based<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.720> this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
high quality sound based on the way this

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
high quality sound based on the way this
is<00:01:48.990> constructed<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.159> five<00:01:50.369> different

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
is constructed we have five different

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
is constructed we have five different
models<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> headphones<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.290> some

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
models of headphones I can we have some

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
models of headphones I can we have some
of<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> table<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.850> will

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
of them on the table right now this will

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.200 
of them on the table right now this will

be our top our top model so this one has

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
be our top our top model so this one has
noise<00:01:57.509> cancellation<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
noise cancellation and you have

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.410 
noise cancellation and you have
something<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.430> these<00:01:59.790> we<00:02:00.000> call<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
something like these we call these the
