00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 how many of you probably already remember in 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 the first part of this video I 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 spent finishing the bathroom which 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 is behind this wall 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.570
 and also replaced the entire branch but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940
 if the corpse tones starting from the kitchen 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 in this part we will talk about fake 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 toilet in one of his previous 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.080
 I showed video clips on this topic 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 a little secret how to get along 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 without internet and outside corners when 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 pvc wall paneling for those who 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.300
 This topic is interesting link to this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 the video you now see on your screen 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.620
 but this time I will touch on the topic of how and what 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.070
 fix the pvc panels in the exterior and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.680
 inside corners in one word to edge a 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 also i will show a little trick and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.300
 installation and fastening 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.700
 toilet floors and also how to regulate 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.239
 water level of the armature in the barrel itself 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.180
 toilet bowl and for what it is done and so 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 the skeleton gave me an already made skeleton I 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.289
 always building only from bars and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.359
 never uses so-called 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.049
 Profile in common they are called 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.500
 tin me why probably yourself 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.729
 guess this we also i 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 mentioned and in one of his previous 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 video clips to the link to this video 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.369
 you now see on your screen when 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 wall paneling bad 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.369
 The beginning of the panel is attached to the liquid nails 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.380
 either start you bad profile but starting 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 always go for sale only in white 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.110
 and can not always be combined with color 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.550
 its wall panels then have to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 use 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.250
 liquid nails back of the panel then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.770
 there is also a burdock fastened with a screw 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.710
 Staplers and why probably many 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 ask this question about this I already 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.840
 told and even showed in one of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.150
 my previous video clips link to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.370
 This topic for those who are interested in you 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:03.780
 now see on your screen and you can 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.420
 view it on my channel also 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.130
 manipulations with liquid nails 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.649
 are held in the inner corners i.e. 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.649
 end panel and exterior corners 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 So I finish the walls has been completed as the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 see I clearly adjusted the panels in 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.480
 inner corners without any gaps and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.610
 clearances, I would especially like to turn your 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.459
 attention to the fact if fails 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.470
 pick the color of the inner pvc corners 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.780
 when carried out repairs 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.549
 the advice of wall panels is not worth it 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.560
 apply white as from 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.660
 hopelessness is better to do then 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 completely without them as in my case 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.900
 agree so it turns out much 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.630
 neater well overall ceiling installation with 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.660
 connecting my new lighting too 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.819
 already done also i already produced and 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.549
 ceramic tile flooring 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.060
 now it is time to fasten the toilet to 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.980
 the floor 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.079
 this is done as follows first 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.430
 prikinuv as he will stand and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.769
 as much as possible 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.530
 maybe sliding it closer to the back 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.459
 mark the markers circular along the wall 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.579
 toilet bowl legs 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.870
 then also with a marker we put marks and in 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.110
 mounting holes 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.120
 then remove the toilet we drill 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.519
 first tile will win you a drill 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.459
 applying a drill and by no means 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.650
 perforator 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.879
 the floor is already drilled in after 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.670
 drilled tile 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.010
 then diggory disappear in the hole and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.290
 put the toilet in place but not to 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.730
 try for an hour with screws without getting into 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.470
 we already have a hole in advance 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.200
 contour on the floor 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.370
 we put on it and tighten the screws to 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.980
 characteristic squeak 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.860
 it means otherwise 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.769
 porcelain as it is either a sanitary toilet 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.620
 If you drag the screw, then the leg of the toilet bowl 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.829
 may crack after the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:17.039
 fasteners whip decorative caps and 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:19.109
 voila ready so now let's talk about 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.840
 adjusting the valve in the barrel itself 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.210
 toilet bowl for what to do it you ask 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.550
 for the least water I will answer 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.889
 now sell about there are so 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.870
 called 2 modes toilets that is 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.699
 fittings in the toilet bowl works with 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.250
 small and large water discharge 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.320
 necessary but not everyone has this 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.479
 and it costs in most cases many 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.270
 there is one mode and when we press 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.830
 on the button to drain the water all the water from the tank 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.590
 toilet bowl but we need 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.810
 or do not need to go and to adjust 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.880
 saving water in the toilet bowl and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.550
 will provide this float if its 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.210
 put in half will be recruited 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.480
 just half a batch and so on like this 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.480
 that's the way 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.910
 on this mission my data premises 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.450
 can be considered fulfilled I am left with 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.070
 you only say goodbye but not for long 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.169
 I hope these videos were for you 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.210
