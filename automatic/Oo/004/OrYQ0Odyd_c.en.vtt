00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello, how about I introduce myself? 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.270
 Socha and these are books just in case 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.510
 good those presentations so that you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.940
 you know and it 's the first time that I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.799
 are you watching and follow me you knew that such 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.450
 and also if you do not know me I'm going to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.859
 comment something the first video of each 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.720
 month I make recommendations of the book and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.010
 this is not going to be the section but also 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'll tell you that it is not a criticism 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 because as I told you in the video 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 past I'm not the one to criticize a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.529
 book I simply recommend books and the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.359
 Grouper book make two miserable of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 Victor hugo this book and something 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 recommended but for reasons not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 I know it was deleted from youtube so it's 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.020
 I bring it back for two reasons because 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 I like the book and because this month in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.710
 mexico is going to release the movie of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 the miserable that at a certain point is not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 much of my grade because I found out that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.289
 is going to be musical emi script this minds 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 musicals like I do not like much 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.760
 because at a certain point they come to me 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.079
 be boring sevillanas arterioas and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 all they want is that the movie 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.620
 keep moving forward but without music that is 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.629
 something is going to happen because it's a movie 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.219
 musical and that's why I bring you the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 book of the miserable because it is one of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 my favorites and I really like it a lot 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.200
 the book of the miserable 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 when I had a certain knowledge about 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.350
 what the book is about, I can simply 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 recommend a margin I can suggest 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 which is one of the best books that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.360
 maybe you can read something interesting about 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 book is that it is not focused only on 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.320
 a character but I think more than three 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 characters in which the last one you go 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 realizing that the characters are 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.940
 relate in one only that really is 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.010
 nice because sometimes it becomes very 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.050
 bored that only the book is 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.790
 talking about a single character and that for 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.650
 I'm kind of nice since many times 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 I do not like to read books that only 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 feel in a single character but not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.230
 leave you is neither here simply you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.910
 I will summarize previously that the book 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.170
 it's about a man called a flame 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.970
 aliens and is not mistaken my 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.010
 French is not good at all it is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.960
 Spanish is also nothing good this 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.880
 alien flame man is a fugitive from the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.560
 justice in which a town arrives and in 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.479
 which from that moment passed a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.190
 circumstance which promises to change 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.110
 his life and he really does it because 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.760
 because he does good things that he did not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.560
 I used to do really free 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.510
 entertaining from the beginning to the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 final I will not tell you anything more about 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.690
 the book because because I already know what 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.100
 I said I do not want all the magic of the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 book you get in one video 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.340
 apart because in this medium 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.509
 movie because I have to do the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.790
 more curt videos because of my work 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 since it does not give me much time to do 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.360
 videos so much so that last month 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.920
 before he started with work 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.959
 excited the bookstore and I bought myself 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.910
 several books which only the 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.560
 thread one but I really have not 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.300
 finished reading and it really is so 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.040
 pathetic because he did not finish reading it anymore 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.190
 which is a very small book is only 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.739
 142 sheets on which is the player of 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.300
 fjords still and it is a book of 142 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.280
 but I only have a hundred pages 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.319
 read so I hope this book 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.670
 does not finish reading this month for later 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.230
 continue with another buy also 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.670
 school didactic for students with 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.470
 attention deficit disorder that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.970
 it really is more for my work but 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.069
 even so they have not had a chance 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.620
 reading the air cut after 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
 the snow and like water for chocolate 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.130
 ready the first of marlon and georg and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.840
 I hope to read the soon to have the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.500
 new developments in the recommendation of the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 month 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.650
 but for you to see that no system does not 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.599
 I had leave in the house description 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.220
 a link in which you can see a 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.560
 short on the film so you can 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 an idea about what transmission you speak and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.569
 I hope I call you attention so that in 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.370
 that book or watch the movie 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.870
 because you read the book but well I think 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.430
 that is all for now just me 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.409
