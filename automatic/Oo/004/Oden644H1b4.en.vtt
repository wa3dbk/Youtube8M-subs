like about this case is at see-through

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
like about this case is at see-through
um<00:00:52.879> one<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> reasons<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:56.149> just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
um one of the reasons is because just

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
um one of the reasons is because just
kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.079> cool<00:00:58.260> effect

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
kind of it's kind of just a cool effect

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.220 
kind of it's kind of just a cool effect
especially<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> iphone<00:01:00.359> users<00:01:00.750> who<00:01:01.020> have

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
especially for the iphone users who have

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.320 
especially for the iphone users who have
either<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> white<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.390> black<00:01:05.000> background<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
either the white or black background of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
either the white or black background of
it<00:01:06.479> back<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> phone<00:01:07.560> i<00:01:07.590> guess<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> could

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it back of the phone i guess you could

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.399 
it back of the phone i guess you could
call<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.250> um<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.840> able<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
call it um you can be able to see that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.510 
call it um you can be able to see that
through<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
through that and that's just going to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
through that and that's just going to
look<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.270> cool<00:01:12.600> another<00:01:13.500> reason<00:01:13.740> why<00:01:13.830> i

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
look really cool another reason why i

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
look really cool another reason why i
like<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.280> through<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
like to see through is because all the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
like to see through is because all the
time<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.259> cases<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.250> speck

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
time with cases like the speck

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
time with cases like the speck
candyshell<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.750> any<00:01:19.320> case<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.340> matter

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
candyshell or any case for that matter

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
candyshell or any case for that matter
if<00:01:20.880> Flint<00:01:21.509> gets<00:01:21.750> stuck<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:22.770> not

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if Flint gets stuck in there you're not

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
if Flint gets stuck in there you're not
going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.640> off<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> case<00:01:24.060> but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
going to know to take off the case but

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
going to know to take off the case but
with<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
with this I can see that there is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.590 
with this I can see that there is
actually<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.570> piece<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> lint<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> case

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
actually a piece of lint in the case

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
actually a piece of lint in the case
right<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.240> cool

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
right now so I think that's really cool

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
right now so I think that's really cool
that<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.430> maintenance

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that you know kind of like a maintenance

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.190 
that you know kind of like a maintenance
things<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.180> I'll<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.450> able<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.020> there

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
things like I'll be able to see if there

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.740 
things like I'll be able to see if there
is<00:01:40.520> actual<00:01:41.520> went<00:01:41.700> behind<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.240> um<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.750> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
is actual went behind this um so it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
is actual went behind this um so it's
clear<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.350> here's<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> S<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> tell<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
clear right here's the S can tell on the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.920 
clear right here's the S can tell on the
sides<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.540> black<00:01:49.079> shiny<00:01:49.590> glossy

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
sides you have this black shiny glossy

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.880 
sides you have this black shiny glossy
polycarbonate<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.320> what's<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.590> cool<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
polycarbonate but what's really cool is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
polycarbonate but what's really cool is
that<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.490> transition<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> clear<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that the transition from the clear to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.149 
that the transition from the clear to
the<00:01:55.979> UM<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:57.719> black<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.200> almost<00:01:58.439> invisible<00:01:58.740> in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the UM the black is almost invisible in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
the UM the black is almost invisible in
terms<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.759> feel<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:02.009> feels<00:02:02.280> like

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
terms of feel this is this feels like

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.660 
terms of feel this is this feels like
it's<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:03.030> case<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.780> just

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's just one case and they just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
it's just one case and they just
spray-painted<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.780> outer<00:02:07.049> Ridge<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
spray-painted the outer Ridge of this

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279 
spray-painted the outer Ridge of this
black<00:02:08.569> I'm<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.720> sure<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.140> they

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
black I'm not sure if that's what they

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.630 
black I'm not sure if that's what they
did<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.530> may<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.739> done<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.340> doesn't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
did they may have done that but doesn't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.170 
did they may have done that but doesn't
I<00:02:11.849> don't<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.209> they<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
I don't think they did but

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.420 
I don't think they did but
feels<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.870> they<00:02:13.959> did<00:02:14.140> which<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.319> kind<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.370> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
feels like they did which is kind of a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.910 
feels like they did which is kind of a
cool<00:02:15.579> effect<00:02:15.930> I'm<00:02:16.930> at<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> top<00:02:17.439> right<00:02:17.620> here

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
cool effect I'm at the top right here

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.959 
cool effect I'm at the top right here
you<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.500> rubber<00:02:20.500> lip<00:02:20.859> um<00:02:21.609> it's<00:02:21.879> a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
you have this rubber lip um it's a

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.910 
you have this rubber lip um it's a
little<00:02:22.269> loose<00:02:22.450> at<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.659> top<00:02:22.959> right<00:02:23.319> here<00:02:23.739> I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
little loose at the top right here I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.860 
little loose at the top right here I
think<00:02:24.609> it's<00:02:24.700> because<00:02:24.790> I've<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.569> been

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
think it's because I've you know been

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
think it's because I've you know been
born<00:02:26.349> I've<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.159> been<00:02:27.310> flicking<00:02:27.640> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
born I've you know just been flicking it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.119 
born I've you know just been flicking it
like<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:29.310> um<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:31.359> case<00:02:31.599> does<00:02:31.870> not<00:02:31.900> cover<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
like that um the case does not cover the

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.899 
like that um the case does not cover the
bezel<00:02:33.549> at<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.689> gets<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.049> about<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.620> UM<00:02:35.909> the

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
bezel at all it gets to about the UM the

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.429 
bezel at all it gets to about the UM the
top<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.359> bezel<00:02:37.659> and<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.319> of

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
top of the bezel and then just kind of

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.280 
top of the bezel and then just kind of
stops<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.920> there<00:02:39.909> really<00:02:40.060> isn't<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.719> lot<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:41.079> um

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
stops and there really isn't a lot of um

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.610 
stops and there really isn't a lot of um
case<00:02:42.189> once<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.120> hit<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.510> screen<00:02:43.840> going<00:02:44.349> up<00:02:44.500> on

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
case once you hit the screen going up on

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.819 
case once you hit the screen going up on
the<00:02:44.650> sides<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.389> were<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.569> drop<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.560> you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
the sides so if I were to drop it you

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.830 
the sides so if I were to drop it you
know<00:02:47.950> face<00:02:48.159> down<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:49.209> could<00:02:49.750> potentially

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
know face down it could potentially

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.440 
know face down it could potentially
crack<00:02:50.439> this<00:02:50.769> yield<00:02:51.040> or<00:02:51.879> at<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.060> screen<00:02:52.269> rather

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
crack this yield or at the screen rather

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.819 
crack this yield or at the screen rather
die<00:02:53.079> for<00:02:53.260> screen<00:02:53.439> chilled<00:02:53.650> on<00:02:53.769> um<00:02:55.829> that's

die for screen chilled on um that's

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.970 
die for screen chilled on um that's
really<00:02:56.980> about<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.760> case<00:02:57.939> this<00:02:58.269> case<00:02:58.540> is

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
really about the case this case is

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
really about the case this case is
extremely<00:02:59.980> thin<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.489> think<00:03:01.299> on<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.419> website

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
extremely thin I think on the website

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.289 
extremely thin I think on the website
said<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.049> was<00:03:02.169> like<00:03:02.379> 1.3<00:03:03.280> 1.4<00:03:03.549> millimeters

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
said it was like 1.3 1.4 millimeters

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.500 
said it was like 1.3 1.4 millimeters
some<00:03:04.959> thick<00:03:05.950> which<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.349> really<00:03:08.349> thin<00:03:09.359> just<00:03:10.359> for

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
some thick which is really thin just for

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.849 
some thick which is really thin just for
a<00:03:10.569> comparison<00:03:10.959> I'll<00:03:11.169> take<00:03:11.349> it<00:03:11.469> off<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.769> then

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
a comparison I'll take it off and then

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.159 
a comparison I'll take it off and then
kind<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.510> sure<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.599> guys<00:03:13.689> what<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.930> looks<00:03:13.959> like

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
kind of sure you guys what it looks like

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.589 
kind of sure you guys what it looks like
in<00:03:14.349> comparison<00:03:14.859> to<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.250> speck<00:03:15.939> candyshell

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
in comparison to the speck candyshell

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.699 
in comparison to the speck candyshell
which<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.109> kind<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.290> flash<00:03:17.979> in<00:03:18.159> there<00:03:18.310> so

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
which I just kind of flash in there so

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.430 
which I just kind of flash in there so
these<00:03:20.709> are<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.919> two<00:03:20.979> cases<00:03:22.169> with<00:03:23.169> hard<00:03:23.349> to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
these are the two cases with hard to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.659 
these are the two cases with hard to
hold<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.970> side<00:03:24.970> by<00:03:25.000> side<00:03:25.180> they<00:03:26.280> may<00:03:27.280> look<00:03:27.609> the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
hold them side by side they may look the

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.199 
hold them side by side they may look the
same<00:03:27.819> they're<00:03:28.180> about<00:03:28.919> mmm<00:03:29.919> speck<00:03:30.729> candyshell

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
same they're about mmm speck candyshell

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.309 
same they're about mmm speck candyshell
is<00:03:31.329> about<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.620> bit<00:03:32.799> wider<00:03:33.129> in<00:03:34.319> terms

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
is about is a little bit wider in terms

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.319 
is about is a little bit wider in terms
of<00:03:35.500> height<00:03:36.479> speck<00:03:37.479> candyshell<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.280> definitely

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of height speck candyshell is definitely

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.429 
of height speck candyshell is definitely
taller<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.569> it's<00:03:40.810> definitely<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.199> little<00:03:41.349> bit

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
taller and it's definitely a little bit

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.030 
taller and it's definitely a little bit
bulkier<00:03:41.889> but<00:03:42.879> um<00:03:43.209> actually<00:03:44.199> what<00:03:44.409> I<00:03:44.650> actually

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
bulkier but um actually what I actually

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.039 
bulkier but um actually what I actually
did<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.609> make<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.849> comparison<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.900> this

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
did want to make a comparison in this

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.280 
did want to make a comparison in this
video<00:03:47.310> um<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.299> get<00:03:49.449> the<00:03:49.569> same<00:03:49.810> protection

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
video um you can get the same protection

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.499 
video um you can get the same protection
with<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.500> reveal<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.819> can<00:03:52.060> get<00:03:52.269> with

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
with the reveal that you can get with

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:56.849 
with the reveal that you can get with
the<00:03:53.109> candy<00:03:53.949> shell<00:03:54.129> and<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.079> this<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.620> why

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
the candy shell and you know this is why

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.369 
the candy shell and you know this is why
so<00:03:57.159> far<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.549> griffin<00:03:57.790> reveal<00:03:57.939> is<00:03:58.269> my<00:03:58.540> favorite

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
so far the griffin reveal is my favorite

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.949 
so far the griffin reveal is my favorite
case<00:03:59.530> i<00:03:59.709> definitely<00:04:00.099> give<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.579> 9<00:04:01.479> out<00:04:01.900> of

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
case i definitely give this a 9 out of

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.009 
case i definitely give this a 9 out of
10<00:04:02.489> I'm<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.639> only<00:04:03.729> reason<00:04:04.030> why<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.810> not<00:04:04.989> a

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
10 I'm the only reason why it's not a

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.800 
10 I'm the only reason why it's not a
