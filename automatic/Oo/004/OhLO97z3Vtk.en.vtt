00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:12.580
 now spiral walls according to the drawings 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.280
 I make in size boards here I have 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 already two walls are assembled two identical 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.230
 walls of 3 meters 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 using the angle and doing the back wall 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.240
 now the length will be what minutes 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 moment kilo and sawed off boards now 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:01:09.820
 I need a bunch 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:01:14.759
 hammer and those single punks connect 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 this is the upper and lower walls already 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.750
 to speed up the build 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.729
 was fixed I know that there 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.860
 level 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.880
 we believe diagonals and after that we put 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 diagonal board 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.970
 I diagonally almost matched on 5 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.970
 millimeters difference 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.450
 like that 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:52.160
 the plan points usual zinced on 7 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 rubles connecting here is a diagonal plank 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.850
 fasten tanks diagonal designs 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 check not necessarily square 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.590
 then come out sideways
