00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
literally 50 feet underwater so the new

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.830 
literally 50 feet underwater so the new
experience<00:05:34.820> but<00:05:35.060> it's<00:05:35.180> going<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.360> take<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.630> bit

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
experience but it's going to take a bit

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.150 
experience but it's going to take a bit
of<00:05:35.870> time<00:05:36.140> and<00:05:36.320> a<00:05:36.380> lot<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.560> work<00:05:36.770> between<00:05:37.070> now

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
of time and a lot of work between now

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.520 
of time and a lot of work between now
and<00:05:37.310> then<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.240> brought<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:39.020> next<00:05:39.320> best

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
and then so I brought the next best

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.860 
and then so I brought the next best
thing<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.360> new<00:05:41.510> City<00:05:41.810> Council

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
Harris if he's arrived and the simply

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.180 
Harris if he's arrived and the simply
been<00:05:47.180> fine<00:05:47.420> too

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
been fine too

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.590 
been fine too
and<00:05:48.280> some<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.580> our<00:05:48.700> team<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:48.910> person<00:05:49.270> joining
