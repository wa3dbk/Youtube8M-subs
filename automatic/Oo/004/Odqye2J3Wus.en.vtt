00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.870
 Hello everyone 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.789
 we end up talking about the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.080
 latest technical preview of windows 10 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 so we recall that this is a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.190
 beta version and that the product is not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 necessarily representative of what we 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.119
 will find in the final version forgiveness 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 of windows 10 so first of all 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 first remark we see here that the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.519
 modern type icons or scroll through 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 in the sense of height and no longer 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.989
 horizontally as was the case 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 with windows 8 or windows 8 points other 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.340
 notice here we see that we find the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 list of applications that can and cie 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 extend to all applications 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 who remain permanently present 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.590
 when you're in tablet mode like 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.149
 this is the case here now then 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 something else what happened to the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.340
 famous bar of charms that we 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.899
 got by making a move 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.430
 slipped from the right 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.039
 well it disappears in favor of a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.870
 notification center that does its 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 appearance with here on the base 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 different shortcut keys and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.029
 especially a key here that allows for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.609
 switch from tablet mode to 

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:10.560
 stops when we want it then other 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.920
 note to switch from an application to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.149
 the other 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.979
 before it was enough to perform a 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.810
 movement slipped from the left 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.639
 and this behavior has also changed 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.829
 because here when we perform a 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:21.299
 slipped motion one accesses a 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.649
 task manager that allows you to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.959
 switch from one application to another 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.029
 instantly and also we access 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.920
 here at the new virtual office that are doing 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:30.719
 their appearance we will see that more in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.999
 detail when in office mode 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.159
 so here we go back to the mode 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.409
 tablet and see how behaves the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.409
 tablet type surface pro 2 when one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.759
 add him the keyboard then here on 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.149
 add the keyboard and what is it going to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.770
 pass 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.419
 and well windows 10 offers us 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.639
 automatically leave the mode 

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.289
 tablet to go back to office mode 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.909
 and there you see the whole of 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.799
 the touch interface condenses for 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.840
 give birth to this new menu 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.770
 start that actually looks not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.259
 a lot to what we could find 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.329
 before on windows 7 and windows vista by 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.739
 example and there in fact they are approaching 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.109
 more of what can be seen on the screen 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.759
 a phone type windows phone 8 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.280
 since we will find here all the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.959
 optimized touch applications that go 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.610
 again parade in the direction of the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130
 height as in tablet mode 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.570
 see you later 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 then another novelty here we will find 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.590
 the search engine that integrates 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.300
 ortana in the English version 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.860
 American and not in the version 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.690
 French so it's 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.430
 inaccessible for this demo I do not 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.570
 could not show you here this 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.250
 search engine makes it possible to perform 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.260
 local searches but also 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.720
 internet searches as it is 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
 indicated here all the way down then regarding 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.810
 the offices of which spoke at the moment 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.250
 how it goes well the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.630
 different virtual desktops so are 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.970
 accessible with this slipped motion 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.160
 also when you are in stop mode 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 alas here for example on this desk 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 I opened the file explorer 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 well we will see it and we also see 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.050
 in passing that icons have been 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 slightly retouched with this 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.310
 technical preview of windows 10 then 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.710
 other small note something else that has 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.600
 changed is how we configure our 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.040
 device under windows 10 so is this 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.410
 than the famous control panel 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.360
 which was not optimized touch 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.340
 gone well that's what we'll see 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.320
 right away and we see that here 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.480
 when you tap configuration panel 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.290
 in the local search engine we're going 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 find it 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.070
 and yes he is still present and he 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.660
 is still not optimized for the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.340
 tactile against some 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.420
 features have disappeared as 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.400
 Windows Update 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.540
 for example here is windows update is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.010
 more present in the panel of 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.260
 configuration then what's going on 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.320
 where is he well we find here 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.670
 now a new a new place 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.830
 where we will be able to configure his 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.840
 computer called all things and 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.880
 whose shortcut is embedded in this 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.310
 notification bar then we click 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.930
 above and there we will find the panel 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.060
 touch configuration that we had 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.310
 already on windows 8 is including windows 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.140
 update we will find this time here 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.060
 see on the icon but everything is 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.590
 optimized touch in terms of interface and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.610
 it is from there that we will manage 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.900
 all of its updates 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.370
 so we also had it in the old 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.180
 touch interface but we see that 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.910
 gradually 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.080
 microsoft is trying to migrate a maximum of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.400
 features of the old panel of 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.350
 configuration to the new who 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.480
 is so called all things then other 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.910
 thing we're going to see just about everything 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.770
 next is how are the rgo 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.300
 nomi in terms of optimization between the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.920
 transition from desktop mode to tablet mode 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.410
 so if we open here for example 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.450
 the mail application which at the base is 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.190
 intended to be integrated in touch mode 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.230
 and so full screen what's going on 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.430
 with this application we could already 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.440
 reduce it before but now we can 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.640
 really the window and is managed its 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.140
 dimensions as desired 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.730
 as if it were any 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.080
 which windows application then that 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.280
 it was already present in the previous 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.230
 technical preview but we did not have 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.550
 still had the opportunity to show you this 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.440
 behavior 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.910
 so here it can be sized we have 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.590
 always access to reduction keys 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.180
 and the closing keys we had 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.460
 already since the dawn of the paintings of windows 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.140
 8 points but how is it 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.430
 pass when we are in tablet mode so 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.690
 in tablet mode logically we can not 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.340
 resize it well that's what we're going 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.840
 see right away we will force the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.700
 switch to tablet mode by clicking here 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.760
 and there automatically she goes into 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.710
 full screen and when you want to manage here 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.970
 the different controls that are 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.150
 present there well we have more than 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.980
 reduction and closures here passage from 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.300
 Full screen mode in full screen mode 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.800
 but eventually it's not going to change big 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.690
 thing in fact there we will be in mode 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.790
 full screen and when you leave it 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.440
 we only have here the taskbar 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.810
 which comes up but concretely 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.680
 we can not resize it 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.330
 when in tablet mode then 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 we could do it in office mode 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.630
 so it's also another small 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.760
 difference then something else that goes 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.800
 to make an appearance here is the arrival 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.620
 an xbox application then 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.970
 the application is directly integrated with 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.070
 windows which means you will not have 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.150
 not to go through the windows store for 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.250
 download it go directly 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.170
 present in the system well eventually 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.490
 in terms of interface good ben I do not know 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.110
 the colors a little dark like that 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.340
 think a little bit about steam even though 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.960
 features are obviously not the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.190
 same but above all we will find the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.350
 same features as we had 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.850
 in the smart ice app on 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.740
 windows phone 8 for example 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.720
 so we go here when we click on his 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.090
 profile find all of his 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.920
 success we will here be able to see the 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.800
 different videos that have been a flood of 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.990
 since its xbox one for example here we have 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.550
 his list of friends who is showing his list 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.080
 Xbox friends breaks all the time posted 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.340
 on the right side of the screen 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.590
 so here are some features 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.660
 with eventually the possibility of recovering 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.850
 the video stream and deport the 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.020
 commands from an xbox one so we'll have 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.250
 the opportunity maybe to review that in 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.590
 an upcoming video 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.420
 finally to finish a last little detail 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.560
 we will find here in office mode 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.790
 so I'll reduce everything by clicking 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.770
 here it still works 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.780
 is that when an application is 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.940
 open we will see a small bar of 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.410
 light color below the icon of 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.610
 the application what tell you 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.030
 that she is turning into a task 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.070
 background 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.600
 what are we going to see here doing this little
