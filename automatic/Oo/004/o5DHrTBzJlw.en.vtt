00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.870
 so got together for the new video 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.380
 here channel 83 million and I want you in 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.720
 this video we show at your bmw 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.790
 exemplary in my z4 35i new 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.730
 could set up battery or on 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.410
 can learn and there are more often 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.119
 problems and we do that together with 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.210
 the bmw head up and this 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 Bluetooth adapter that is cheap 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.619
 amazon is a known one of mine 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.180
 distributes and these are real product 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.680
 by absolutely behind many stand the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 We can subscribe already 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.700
 I have actually seen it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.200
 everything here in the dare so what do you have to 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 let's put this usb dvb t2 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.610
 experienced down here in the op de 2 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.020
 connection and see what also directly the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.820
 he starts to shine 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.800
 Now communicates with bluetooth 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.690
 can the whole system too 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.510
 bluetooth is for an android system 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.340
 you can also take it for his iphone 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 then there is a wlan adapter couple link 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.119
 below the videos in the infobox 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.039
 Next, here you have the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.060
 go settings and the whole with 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.060
 connect bluetooth 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.190
 Lighting conditions are the best there 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.170
 made 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.790
 ever it gets a little better that way only 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 times would switch on bluetooth 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.369
 of course, help logically as you do 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.990
 I can already see that here too 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.810
 adapter I've got that ever 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 coupled is a left as he becomes 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.600
 shown here but this part 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.950
 and the one already selected is already 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 that is, we will become the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.080
 connection and down there already shines 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.530
 So what are we going to do next? 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.300
 Let's start the bmw head app now 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.869
 it for both the iphone and for 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.570
 Android devices 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.190
 I 'm doing it completely again now 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.399
 and then new on it so he really everyone 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.080
 I can understand him step by step 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.899
 that's the perfect position for me 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.899
 think so it is better so bmw would have 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.930
 yes already the connection 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.680
 Called there is a small exam 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.590
 here blablabla it is all right so too 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.570
 is furnished with me with the z4 89 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.700
 connected makes it also times the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.840
 Ignition falls on that went out 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.100
 will be like that and then we will be out here 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.930
 bluetooth we want in the blood 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.880
 discuss or now overrun 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.160
 You could also set up via cable 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.110
 It is up to each one to do that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 older vehicles you have to even over 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.280
 make the cable work then go 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.549
 we say the top of the home area in 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.049
 Ebbs and now we have three options 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.940
 the first expanded the 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.010
 dieselpartikelfilter that comes in the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.760
 next time loud developers then have 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.519
 the possibility of the service 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 reset interval costs 4 euro 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.810
 50 as I understand it once 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340
 If you have paid 450 can 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.600
 this is also the case with other vehicles 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340
 make several times or the same 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.959
 vehicle and the same is true for 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 the battery is your extreme here 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.970
 However, it costs in the app in app purchase 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 9 eur 95 is not cheap but is 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.470
 just a really simple thing 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.040
 I have already bought land 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.810
 Accordingly, I will click here now 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.190
 just on battery and now I have 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.359
 of course completely forgotten here at the beginning 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.220
 click on connect 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.050
 Thus, the vehicle is not 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.460
 connected as he sees them here now 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.080
 can now be the connection 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.320
 I just made it sorry 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.700
 for that and here I will have one more 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.890
 Checking everything now runs 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.930
 here about the obd two adapters of the box 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.690
 it was over at the bottom 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.330
 bluetooth is running like that and now we see 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.530
 also the vehicle is connected or app 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.670
 with the vehicle and then we can 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.080
 now here in the individual 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.120
 parameter or in the individual 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.650
 functions Rhine between going now 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.750
 here in the ebbs function where I too 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.400
 just now everyone was voting 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.230
 Battery off and now it will be the whole 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.800
 also worked now heard or now 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.920
 that works too 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.440
 now there is an error message sorry 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 no error message of a warning message 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.200
 that everything runs on its own responsibility 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.920
 Etc 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.170
 the need to confirm with ok yet 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.430
 click once and confirm so then have 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.660
 We now two possibilities we 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.800
 can now registrations same 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.630
 say battery type if we select that 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.310
 the current battery is read out 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.310
 is now watched what is this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.460
 battery and you are me 60 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 amperestunden agm battery so already 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.520
 pretty new model 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.990
 accordingly that saudi the ex factory 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.650
 with me is needed now 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.330
 to discuss 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.660
 I would now have this sheet around the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.590
 same matter issue again 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.640
 retrofitted or replaced exactly 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.990
 I would say exchanged 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.360
 then I would just click 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.000
 register new battery and the new battery 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.790
 battery would be in the control unit for that 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.290
 responsible is coded 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.820
 that's all we have then 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.050
 Of course, the option if you say 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.490
 next to me, the battery is not enough 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.610
 now want other batteries one 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.840
 have stronger set up or retrofit 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.410
 I retrofitted then I click 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.450
 registration of another battery and 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.070
 Now get the following option like that 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.830
 now we have the here 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.500
 possibility the amperestunden so the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.750
 current battery type as well as just 70 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.250
 Ah, ah, or well known hers 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.300
 such a stink normal so very small me 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.780
 then the car will not believe it 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.620
 start 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.750
 with 55 amp hours and so on 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.780
 set up and then come here too 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.520
 later it was only scrolling or scrolling 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.850
 this little window up in egg 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.440
 now we have the after that too 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.010
 agm batteries like you can see 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.639
 behind the 70 amp hours ah gm stands 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.469
 also a 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.330
 this is my battery we also know 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.310
 and then I could as well 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.349
 good to use a stronger one I would have 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.249
 Now here's 91 best and would 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.539
 then just on new battery type 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.610
 click and then that would be in the 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.110
 So really written ECU 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.020
 a very simple thing with the bmw 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.370
 head up for the people with the nc it 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.599
 then not so well come out or for 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.219
 this just a bit too 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.599
 is awkward if you already have one 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.050
 must be a little deeper in the 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.029
 matter and yes in that sense is that 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.219
 clearly not recommended now 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.759
 quite cheap costs 45 euros for the app 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:14.500
 plus again 995 for the registration 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.939
 But bmw takes similar prices from 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.860
 That's why it's very interesting if you 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.789
 anyway would like to make other codings 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.860
 or has already done 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.189
 this is a cool one with the whole system 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.330
 thing yes as I said the second character 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.060
 you are in the bottom 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.310
 I also give you the bottom ones inside 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.050
 our video in the infobox 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.490
 So you can order as well 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.060
 It really is a great part I can only do 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.449
 recommend 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.449
 and if you liked the video 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:44.189
