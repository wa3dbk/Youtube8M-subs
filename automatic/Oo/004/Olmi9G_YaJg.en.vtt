00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.590
 I recommend your channel this one has 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 good videos are very good and they 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.890
 I want to say that all of us learn 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.420
 we learn different some of us 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.229
 we learn better by listening to some 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.080
 we learn better by watching this 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.840
 some of us need tops 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.390
 here in front of the screen that's why 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.270
 that I do my my videos good deal 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.580
 make my videos for everyone this is why 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.560
 there they see that I tell them for the most 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.000
 advanced advance the video to the minute 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880
 already indicated to play the song 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 complete with me this one sometimes touched the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.650
 requintos more slowly with the tips this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 because I know that the most advanced can 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.630
 learn like that just by watching the tips and I 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.970
 playing slowly and then I say ok 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.890
 for beginners please stay 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.590
 with me a little bit more videos of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.190

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.670
 my videos 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.850
 he teaches faster than me but still 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.880
 It is very clear what the teacher teaches 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.820
 this iodide more is that when I'm 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 teaching in front of the camera to 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.400
 same time that I'm talking and 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.950
 teaching I'm thinking 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.860
 what a prince has to think a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.530
 beginner here at this time and it's 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.470
 why I repeat a lot this I take my 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.770
 time is that I want to ensure that the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.780
 beginners those who are barely 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.170
