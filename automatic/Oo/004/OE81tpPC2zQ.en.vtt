thing that just I can't understand the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
thing that just I can't understand the
logic<00:00:31.650> off<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> when<00:00:32.369> Robin<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:32.940> blatantly

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
logic off is when Robin is so blatantly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.479 
logic off is when Robin is so blatantly
dived<00:00:33.840> earlier<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> game<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.219> try<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
dived earlier on in the game to try and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
dived earlier on in the game to try and
win<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> penalty<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.050> referee<00:00:37.350> hasn't

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
win a penalty and the referee hasn't

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
win a penalty and the referee hasn't
given<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.460> only<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.149> things

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
given it I can only be one of two things

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
given it I can only be one of two things
either<00:00:39.780> he's<00:00:40.320> dived<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> penalty<00:00:41.430> if

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
either he's dived or it's a penalty if

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.430 
either he's dived or it's a penalty if
his<00:00:41.790> dive<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> gets<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> yellow<00:00:42.510> card<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
his dive to gets a yellow card and then

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
his dive to gets a yellow card and then
when<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.100> me<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.850> looks<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.270> he's<00:00:45.450> dived

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
when to me it looks like he's dived

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
when to me it looks like he's dived
again<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> referee<00:00:47.010> fall<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
