00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.680
 Hello friends subscribers before 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.840
 I wish you an excellent year 2015 and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.480
 welcome to this year's first video 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 I want to share this interesting 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.680
 information that cost me a lot of work 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.630
 I got a lot of research 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.520
 time on the web and on various pages 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.860
 of astronomy about information 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.660
 who are about to listen does 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.340
 approximately six years was 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.950
 discovered an asteroid with a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.350
 rotational movement very strange this 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.480
 asteroid of approximately 300 meters 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.969
 in diameter was observed near Saturn 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.519
 with a very eccentric elliptical orbit 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.620
 Every year, asteroids are identified 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.390
 within the solar system many of them 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.609
 very small and others the size of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 mountains but very rarely is found 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.989
 one like this this asteroid travels with 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.999
 a speed ten times faster than 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.980
 that of a bullet in an elliptical direction 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.289
 that to continue like this it is very likely that 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.630
 impact with the earth the next 22 of 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.730
 June although it can not be predicted with 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.890
 accuracy the trajectory of an asteroid 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.840
 with an orbit as strange as that of 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.790
 this the few astronomers who have said 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.110
 something about it they are very 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.940
 worried 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 now all the information about 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.810
 celestial bodies is available 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.450
 of all public but has not said 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.220
 nothing official about this asteroid I 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.350
 personally, I am in favor of 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.270
 two cases will hide information for 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 ensure order in society but 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.110
 I think that this information should 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.870
 reveal it in later days since 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 this is a really serious problem 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.440
 now I will tell you in detail the information 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.910
 that I managed to obtain and the probabilities 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.880
 scientific that this asteroid 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.010
 impact the earth this information the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.140
 I found in three links on the web that 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.990
 I will post since the three are illegal 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 pages called this asteroid mk 08 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.830
 I do not know if that is his official name or just 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.770
 it is a code name for 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.660
 refer to mk 08 is visible by 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.310
 any high civil telescope 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.380
 power but it would be impossible 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.509
 identify it since no civilian has 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.000
 the technology to calculate your address 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.310
 It was officially discovered 7 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 October 2008 by the department of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.420
 Australian astronomy and data 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.030
 they were sent to the USA to be 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.519
 studied has a diameter of 300 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.710
 meters and an approximate weight of 120 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.840
 tons the orbit of mk 0 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.000
 It is very similar to any body 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.770
 celestial but its movement of rotation 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 it is very unstable similar to that of 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.240
 apophis asteroid with which you can not 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.430
 accurately predict your trajectory and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.890
 that its mass strangely distributed 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.860
 produces changes in movement some 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.300
 scientists claim that this movement 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.340
 unpredictable can change its orbit what 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.140
 enough to deflect your trajectory 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.820
 towards the earth but the speed that 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.710
 takes this asteroid leaves few 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.660
 possibilities that was the little 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.820
 information that I found and still I 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.530
 It took me a while to get it, I decided 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.930
 share it since the information was 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.390
 scientifically logical and showed several 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 evidence in the documents if they have entered 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.260
 to the web and they know how to use it in a 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.750
 objective, I invite you to investigate 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.910
 this in the same way I invite you to see 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.830
 my other videos and subscribe if so 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.460
 they wish you have an excellent day 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.460
 see you later
