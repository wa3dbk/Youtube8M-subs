okay I'm gonna be taking a look at a
couple<00:00:13.780> Android<00:00:14.230> applications<00:00:14.889> so<00:00:15.099> let's<00:00:15.339> get

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
couple Android applications so let's get

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
this application was made by the same

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.290 
this application was made by the same
people<00:00:23.109> who<00:00:23.320> made<00:00:23.710> glow<00:00:23.980> hockey<00:00:24.009> and<00:00:25.000> what<00:00:25.179> it

next application will be taking a look

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.289 
next application will be taking a look
at<00:02:16.269> age<00:02:16.390> drift<00:02:16.780> mania<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.760> essentially<00:02:19.269> a

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
at age drift mania it's essentially a

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.850 
at age drift mania it's essentially a
drifting<00:02:19.810> game<00:02:19.989> when<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.319> have<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> drift

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
drifting game when you have to drift

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.309 
drifting game when you have to drift
round<00:02:21.069> corners<00:02:21.459> though<00:02:21.879> more<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.810> drift<00:02:23.110> or

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
round corners though more you drift or

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.199 
round corners though more you drift or
more<00:02:23.500> points<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.040> get<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.849> have<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
more points you get you have the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.819 
more points you get you have the
accelerometer<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.410> handbrake

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
accelerometer in here in the handbrake

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.860 
accelerometer in here in the handbrake
as<00:02:27.040> well<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.120> make<00:02:28.269> drift<00:02:28.720> around

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
as well so you can make drift around

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.370 
as well so you can make drift around
corners<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.440> lot<00:02:29.620> easier<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.870> does<00:02:32.079> take<00:02:32.349> a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
corners a lot easier it does take a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.460 
corners a lot easier it does take a
while<00:02:32.560> future<00:02:33.340> master<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:34.170> once<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.319> get

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
while future master and once you get

lines and it keeps bouncing in you have

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:46.900 
lines and it keeps bouncing in you have
to<00:03:36.080> try<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.500> hit<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:38.290> markers<00:03:44.260> oops<00:03:45.910> just

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
to try and hit the markers oops just

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.130
