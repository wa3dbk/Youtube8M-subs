00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.300
 what can be said about the phone 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.049
 the phone is very cool not pulling 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.950
 state employee she's an expensive phone real for 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.369
 working hours 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.810
 glitches not detected at all somewhere 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:29.189
 there is no braking no glitch interface 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 nothing as you can see a great phone 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 I really liked it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.960
 my acquaintances, too, the thickness is still in 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.690
 5 5 it is only from glass to metal 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.690
 yes of course the total thickness is 9 millimeters 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.620
 of the shortcomings I can attribute it to the weak 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.960
 the speakers are still rather weak 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.210
 not bad goes well, it was rather weak 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.829
 help me do more battery work 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.010
 the most basic element which 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.170
 discussed for finding batteries enough well 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.369
 fly on the tests look at your own 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.640
 the player shows about 70 hours 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.979
 on m m cor player with external tg 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.140
 I ran the films showed three with 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:33.240
 a half hour total full load 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.189
 four hours if you just use 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.390
 phone load 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:47.130
 enough for a few days I thought that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.680
 Modelka will come all the same as 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.259
 stated in the first installments 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.399
 glitches in braking for what are you 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.579
 well without any problems what I can 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.920
 say about the camera the camera takes off 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.520
 fine well when magnifying 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.209
 j3 its still there electronic stabilization 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.349
 add was generally super 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.640
 Perhaps this is because of the budget option 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.670
 save on something 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 here they do well now let's 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 go to. 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.760
 5 sensors 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.790
 We go as plays miracast 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.450
 see the delay what happens
