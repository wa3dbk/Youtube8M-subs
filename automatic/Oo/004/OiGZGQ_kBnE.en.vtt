00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 there's a fourth girl last month though 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.410
 I didn't buy the products 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.580
 academic vmk we showed 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 this palette here the android mix e 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 several of you don't remember if I had 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.550
 I made a video of him if I had done 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 boom face of the don't remember has between 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 the other one washed the hair and in my opinion 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 however this color is too dark 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 glad enough to have darkened them 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 we say, but not too so 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 dark to lighten up a little 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 look at the link committed on the blog see 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.469
 sign because I copied some images 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.600
 of actresses with dark hair that me 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.640
 like them I'd like to know yours 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.289
 opinion on which color could be me 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.300
 well, but let's move on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.710
 I don't remember if I had made an oil alone 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 a face of the day with this palette 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 here and smith and many, many 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.550
 melegati said montali is the fact 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 well among other things is the precise pair 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.800
 of the naked your looks that nice yes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 they are inspired by the naked maran and that gives 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 lots of colors while the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.430
 transmission has a bit of me I have not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 not even the other day Sunday that I was 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.439
 at home to waste time 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.650
 I practically took the two pallets e 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.180
 observing the good both are me 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.220
 realizes that they not only have both 12 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.650
 colors 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.009
 because you see from andre smith 16 above 6 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.619
 under the naked two it has 2 4 6 2 4 6 8 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.979
 10 12 precise that not only have 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.020
 both 12 colors that not only the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.899
 palettes are similar but in fact i 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.110
 colors are the same and are also allowed 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.720
 in the same order or the last 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.909
 color and black the first is that e 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.420
 berlin what I did 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.120
 but in the end he had it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 used the naked one twice 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.300
 I liked it very much I started with a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.270
 white sheet and I said let's do some 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.670
 of tests and wanted to share with you i 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.060
 results then give yourself a moment that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 system ok 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.280
 this is the result ok, I put it on 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.880
 otherwise I 'm not sure no harry later 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.420
 love here then I wanted to show you 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.910
 tell you a few things first 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.700
 general opinion absolutely yes 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.120
 two blades are interchangeable 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.260
 so if you don't have 40 euros to spend 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.790
 in the born two but you have maybe 5 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.490
 what the uu android mutu costs 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.250
 absolutely throw me and laugh 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.230
 absolutely go for the amur un 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.970
 couple of clarifications this will be a 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.370
 very very fast video part I would say that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:00.330
 the images speak for themselves some some 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 colors of the moore are less intense 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.870
 compared to those of the m 2 and I tell you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 quaino strengthens comparable sims ars 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.610
 baker also boutique all 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.709
 I don't know if you see it but the one from 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.070
 walls is a little less intense than in quo 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:22.489
 of the same chopper naked equal Teese 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:25.560
 snakebite equal suspects I find the naked 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.030
 a little less intense or even 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.100
 compared to that of mou has therefore 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.450
 writes is better than mou respect 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.110
 on the naked 2 equal pistor word wide e 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:42.530
 of kay year to the dark a little bit less 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.530
 intense enough equal equal blackouts 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.510
 Consider it seems like mine is one 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.720
 opinion 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.670
 from a lover of tricks but absolutely 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.300
 not of the professional maybe one 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.100
 touch a professional make-up artist 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.810
 in stadiums he will give an opinion 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.490
 completely different telling you no 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.420
 this crap this and not plus 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.370
 ultra 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.320
 I talk to you about normal people who are 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.180
 morning put on makeup in ten minutes 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.650
 love to have so many colors but then 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.800
 all in all they always wear make-up 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.440
 same way and that feel a little bit 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.390
 in the sense I played a bit with 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.810
 both palettes I put on 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.430
 sheet and these are my opinions 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.460
 maybe even the dukes that come out 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.040
 occasionally mark a color equal to 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.470
 medellin or what i know i mean mame thing 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.690
 I don't care if maybelline lasts half an hour 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.300
 less rather than putting us by quoting 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.160
 a color of exhibited under cinema money 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.500
 having more or less the same result 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.600
 I'm really happy then 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.450
 absolutely if you already have it 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.250
 don't buy this if you do 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.290
 like it but it costs too much for you 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.390
 absolutely buy this one enough 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.200
 this is my opinion on these two 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:55.300
 theoretically equal pallets I would say that there 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.300
 we are made
