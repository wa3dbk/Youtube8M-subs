a the high aperture value will allow you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
a the high aperture value will allow you
to<00:00:43.860> balance<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.610> low<00:00:44.820> shutter<00:00:45.150> speed<00:00:45.510> you're

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to balance the low shutter speed you're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
to balance the low shutter speed you're
going<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.049> to<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:46.979> some<00:00:47.159> really

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
going to need to get some really

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.270 
going to need to get some really
interesting<00:00:47.519> streaks<00:00:48.479> of<00:00:48.629> light<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.280> be

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
interesting streaks of light and be

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
interesting streaks of light and be
since<00:00:51.089> you're<00:00:51.210> using<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.540> tripod<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.290> high

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
since you're using a tripod a high

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.469 
since you're using a tripod a high
aperture<00:00:52.979> will<00:00:53.129> let<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.400> get<00:00:53.640> nice<00:00:53.940> sharp

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
aperture will let you get nice sharp

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.810 
aperture will let you get nice sharp
photographs<00:00:55.100> now<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> you've<00:00:56.430> set<00:00:56.670> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
photographs now that you've set your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
photographs now that you've set your
aperture<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.659> now<00:00:57.750> set<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.019> shutter

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
aperture you can now set your shutter

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.039 
aperture you can now set your shutter
speed<00:00:58.790> what<00:00:59.790> you<00:00:59.909> probably<00:01:00.360> need<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.659> do<00:01:00.900> is

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
speed what you probably need to do is

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.770 
speed what you probably need to do is
start<00:01:01.290> at<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> certain<00:01:02.010> value<00:01:02.460> say<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.540> or<00:01:03.659> two

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
start at a certain value say one or two

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
start at a certain value say one or two
seconds<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.430> trial<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.000> error<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
seconds and then use trial and error to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
seconds and then use trial and error to
get<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.690> best<00:01:06.990> shutter<00:01:07.440> speed<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:07.950> your

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
get the best shutter speed for your

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.760 
get the best shutter speed for your
scene<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.630> I'll<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> start<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.650> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
scene so what I'll do is start at about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.970 
scene so what I'll do is start at about
two<00:01:11.190> seconds<00:01:11.780> take<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> few<00:01:13.050> pictures<00:01:13.230> see<00:01:13.860> what

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
two seconds take a few pictures see what

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.850 
two seconds take a few pictures see what
effect<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.300> then<00:01:16.170> I'll<00:01:16.470> just

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
effect I can get and then I'll just

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
effect I can get and then I'll just
change<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.310> shutter<00:01:17.520> speed<00:01:17.670> leaving<00:01:18.330> my

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
change the shutter speed leaving my

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
change the shutter speed leaving my
aperture<00:01:19.050> where<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:20.090> because<00:01:21.090> you're

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
aperture where it is because you're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.610 
aperture where it is because you're
shooting<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.660> night<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> usually<00:01:22.260> go<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
shooting at night you can usually go to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.830 
shooting at night you can usually go to
a<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:23.040> low<00:01:23.310> shutter<00:01:23.670> speed<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> still

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a very low shutter speed and still

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.790 
a very low shutter speed and still
produce<00:01:25.020> some<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.470> interesting

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
produce some really interesting

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.649 
produce some really interesting
photographs

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.380 

so<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.560> sum<00:01:32.799> up<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.189> shoot<00:01:33.579> long<00:01:33.880> exposure

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
so to sum up to shoot long exposure

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.480 
so to sum up to shoot long exposure
photos<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.899> traffic<00:01:35.350> first<00:01:35.649> make<00:01:36.039> sure<00:01:36.250> you're

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
photos of traffic first make sure you're

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.200 
photos of traffic first make sure you're
using<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.850> tripod<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.950> set<00:01:39.430> your<00:01:39.579> ISO<00:01:39.729> to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
using a tripod and then set your ISO to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.160 
using a tripod and then set your ISO to
the<00:01:40.299> lowest<00:01:40.689> value<00:01:41.110> possible<00:01:42.659> use<00:01:43.659> manual

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the lowest value possible use manual

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.620 
the lowest value possible use manual
mode<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.679> set<00:01:44.950> your<00:01:45.130> aperture<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.759> about<00:01:46.000> f10

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
mode and set your aperture to about f10

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.770 
mode and set your aperture to about f10
or<00:01:46.659> f11<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:48.090> finally<00:01:49.090> set<00:01:49.450> your<00:01:49.630> shutter

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
or f11 you finally set your shutter

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.050 
or f11 you finally set your shutter
speed<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.350> very<00:01:50.679> low<00:01:50.920> value<00:01:51.159> about<00:01:51.789> two

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060

series of photographs and try using
different<00:01:56.500> speeds<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> effect<00:01:57.549> you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
different speeds to get the effect you
