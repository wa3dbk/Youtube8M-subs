wrap up so that I'm quite Hartley with a
line<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.170> I'll<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.409> turn<00:01:28.590> around

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
line for that so I'll just turn around

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.760 
line for that so I'll just turn around

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
are touched and just trim the stop off
and<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.759> catch<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and all I'm gonna do is catch that in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.560 
and all I'm gonna do is catch that in
that's<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.350> simple<00:01:40.799> fight<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> die<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's very simple fight it die but the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.770 
that's very simple fight it die but the
material<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> makes<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.439> difference

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
material that makes a difference

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
material that makes a difference
alright<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:46.950> nice<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.970> go

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
alright so that's nice and even so go

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.050 
alright so that's nice and even so go
back<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.780> again

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
back down again

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.399 
back down again
now<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.299> use<00:01:51.420> different<00:01:51.659> variations

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
now you can use different variations

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.980 
now you can use different variations
different<00:01:52.590> columns

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
different columns

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.010 
different columns
definite<00:01:54.990> color<00:01:55.290> flat<00:01:55.590> sees<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.840> I'll

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
definite color flat sees but I see I'll

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.120 
definite color flat sees but I see I'll
show<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.799> I'll<00:01:58.920> show<00:01:59.100> you
