intersection<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:58.179> allows<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.660> make<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
intersection it allows you to make the

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.110 
intersection it allows you to make the
same<00:00:59.140> left<00:00:59.499> hand<00:00:59.800> guitar<00:01:00.249> shapes<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:00.820> you

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
same left hand guitar shapes that you

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.270 
same left hand guitar shapes that you
normally<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.559> would<00:01:02.679> make<00:01:02.829> playing<00:01:03.159> a

normally that you would make playing a

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.380 
normally that you would make playing a
real<00:01:03.460> guitar<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.870> it's<00:01:05.080> it's<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:06.060> pretty<00:01:07.060> good

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
real guitar so it's it's a pretty good

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.090 
real guitar so it's it's a pretty good
simulation<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.230> a<00:01:08.290> pretty<00:01:08.530> good<00:01:08.650> teaching

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100

the<00:01:11.470> guitar<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.360> buttons<00:01:13.660> are<00:01:13.780> easy

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.030 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy
to<00:01:14.080> press<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.470> don't<00:01:14.620> have<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.830> develop

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
to press you don't have to develop

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.370 
to press you don't have to develop
calluses<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.180> left<00:01:16.360> hand<00:01:16.480> has<00:01:16.750> buttons<00:01:17.200> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.830 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to
simulate<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.400> left<00:01:18.640> hand<00:01:18.940> sort<00:01:19.480> of<00:01:19.540> cord

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840

have<00:01:26.320> six<00:01:26.620> simulated<00:01:27.280> strings<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.030> will

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
have six simulated strings that will

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.830 
have six simulated strings that will
pick<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:29.950> pluck<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.840> translate
