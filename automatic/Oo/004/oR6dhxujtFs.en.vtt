00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
bundles of six but I'm repeating on the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.850 
bundles of six but I'm repeating on the
second<00:00:37.649> string<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.809> four<00:00:39.809> five<00:00:40.079> six<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> then

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
second string so four five six and then

repeat<00:00:41.250> again<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.530> repeat<00:00:43.829> again<00:00:48.710> okay

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
repeat again and then repeat again okay

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.229 
repeat again and then repeat again okay
when<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.199> counting<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.710> six<00:00:53.129> don't<00:00:53.850> count

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
when you're counting out six don't count

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.920 
when you're counting out six don't count
one<00:00:54.899> two<00:00:55.110> three<00:00:55.379> four<00:00:55.680> five<00:00:55.980> six<00:00:56.250> count<00:00:57.239> across

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
one two three four five six count across

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.939 
one two three four five six count across
the<00:00:58.140> string<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.850> more<00:00:59.850> sense<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> reason

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the string one more sense and the reason

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
the string one more sense and the reason
for<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.059> helps<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> rhythm<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
for that is it helps with the rhythm and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:15.730 
for that is it helps with the rhythm and
helps<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> maintain

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.920 

six<00:01:16.880> okay<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.450> course<00:01:18.480> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.840> play

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
six okay and then of course you can play

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.180 
six okay and then of course you can play
the<00:01:19.080> same<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.290> backwards

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.930 

yeah

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:42.770 

okay<00:01:26.940> so<00:01:27.000> okay<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.510> little<00:01:27.780> quicker

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.860 

okay<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.650> practice<00:01:44.130> doing<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.690> so

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
okay so practice doing that and so

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.150 
okay so practice doing that and so
that's<00:01:46.050> where<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.560> start<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
that's where I would start with that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.290 
that's where I would start with that
lick<00:01:47.430> their<00:01:48.270> thing<00:01:48.540> practice<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> clean<00:01:50.270> work

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
lick their thing practice it clean work

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:01.780 
lick their thing practice it clean work
you<00:01:51.510> know<00:01:51.630> cleaner

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.430 

and<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.940> course<00:02:03.150> like<00:02:03.299> anything<00:02:03.570> started<00:02:04.200> slow

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and of course like anything started slow

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.200 
and of course like anything started slow
and<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.220> know<00:02:05.310> you'll<00:02:05.520> build<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.940> speed

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and you know you'll build up the speed

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
and you know you'll build up the speed
you'll<00:02:06.810> find<00:02:07.080> though<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.740> sort<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you'll find though this one sort of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.669 
you'll find though this one sort of
leads<00:02:08.819> itself<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> don't<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.350> try

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
leads itself like you don't have to try

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.270 
leads itself like you don't have to try
too<00:02:10.740> hard<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.340> concentrate<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> picking

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
too hard to concentrate on the picking

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.500 
too hard to concentrate on the picking
now<00:02:14.280> you're<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.970> employ<00:02:15.240> your

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
now you're going to have to employ your

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.110 
now you're going to have to employ your
thinking<00:02:15.930> hand<00:02:16.200> which<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
thinking hand which is this one for the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.490 
thinking hand which is this one for the
next<00:02:18.300> part<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.870> that's<00:02:18.989> what<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:19.319> going<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
next part and that's what we're going to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.770 
next part and that's what we're going to
do<00:02:19.680> we're<00:02:19.920> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.130> move<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.880> around<00:02:21.209> so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
do we're going to move this around so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830 
do we're going to move this around so
I'm<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.080> play<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.770> 1<00:02:22.950> 2<00:02:23.160> 3<00:02:23.190> 4<00:02:23.819> 5<00:02:24.060> 6<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
then I'm going to slide up on the same

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.640 
then I'm going to slide up on the same
string<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.440> play<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.920> next<00:02:29.280> bundle<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.700> six

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
six and then I'm going to slide back on
this<00:02:34.050> string<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:36.810> here

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.180 

okay<00:02:45.750> I'll<00:02:45.930> play<00:02:46.140> right<00:02:46.290> again<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.890> we're

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.710 

now<00:03:11.160> I'm<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.519> really<00:03:11.730> picking<00:03:12.150> hard<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.569> use<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
now I'm not really picking hard I use a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.490 
now I'm not really picking hard I use a
sharp<00:03:13.049> pick<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:15.110> this<00:03:16.110> one's<00:03:16.290> actually

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
sharp pick like that this one's actually

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.530 
sharp pick like that this one's actually
kind<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.040> dulled<00:03:17.310> down<00:03:17.459> because<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.239> played

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
kind of dulled down because I played

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.960 
kind of dulled down because I played
with<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.049> all<00:03:19.170> day<00:03:19.379> but<00:03:21.739> that's<00:03:22.739> why<00:03:22.890> my

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
with it all day but that's why my

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.970 
with it all day but that's why my
strangely<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:25.319> know<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.500> sounds<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.769> I'm

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
strangely you know it sounds like I'm

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.160 
strangely you know it sounds like I'm
smacking<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> crap<00:03:27.030> out<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.420> strings<00:03:27.870> but

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
smacking the crap out of the strings but

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.119 
smacking the crap out of the strings but
I'm<00:03:28.260> really<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.829> because<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.069> play

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
I'm really not it's just because I play

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.949
