00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 sure if then this giveaway e 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 particular is rather unique because in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 four years I never gave one 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 what so and I wanted to do it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 particularly with this because I know that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.900
 she liked so many of you because of me 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.500
 you have seen it in so many 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.369
 a lot of videos I have an idea I don't have 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.369
 I talk about it I'll show you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.090
 yes, the frame is only yogis and becomes 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.879
 therefore local between house I joking 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.350
 then there is the jacket of 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.510
 stradivarius skin because here it does 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.230
 so why the other day are 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.059
 I go back almost certainly come back 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.920
 we have this mall 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.750
 which is called fiordelisi which is located at 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.080
 los angeles is not called race me 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.519
 not bad either and then I went by 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.500
 stradivarius that shop that I love 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.140
 I love and that made me discover the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.649
 sister and I saw him because I had 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.850
 long ago he believed he created September 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.190
 I don't want to be wrong, he still has some 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 months ago and then there was no longer that is not 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.280
 I saw it more inside things 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.690
 In fact, many of you wondered if 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.500
 it could still be found, etc. 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.910
 etc 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.009
 then when I returned the other day 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.930
 I saw him again and immediately thought of 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.490
 take it and put it up for grabs for 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.140
 web deal is something I've never done 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.460
 that I never do as a gift of 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.110
 clothes because they never are 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.790
 sure what to give because 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.770
 clearly one thing may please me but 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.720
 you may not like it but I know that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 this jacket loved it a 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.799

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.020

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.970
 seven different videos in which I carried it and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 I know it 's a time when 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.420
 however they make lots of jackets of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.380
 this is really studded leather 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 really beautiful so this is the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.420
 prize for the giveaway 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.009
 and I'm not letting you see that much 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 because there are so many videos in 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.700
 but that state really is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.100
 cute is very special because a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.079

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.709

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.120
 all these all these details 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.090
 golden and with this strap on the handle 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 that days 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.670
 what he said share miari never said 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.430
 strap will use a strap a 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.239
 this ash on the sleeves that to me 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.370
 really like to keep them turned upside down 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.200
 paid is very very very good 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 another nice thing too and that here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.900
 on shoulder pads like this 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.230
 call this here it is 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.450
 this brought exact degrees that you remember 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.269
 a little military style, however, one thing 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.920
 very beautiful indeed that has all these 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.569
 all these special golden details 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
 I talk about it from this god 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.390
 played but because I really love it and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.819
 I bring it billions of ways with a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.370
 super aggressive supersexy outfit 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.530
 stale being divinely has been of even 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.079
 with a very casual free is a lot 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.120
 very well in my opinion also with a 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.090
 dress underneath I didn't dress elegantly 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.060
 men at fritz men appreciate 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.940
 a lot because it's very nice in my opinion 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.310
 combine two completely different styles 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.350
 like the romantic style with that a little 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 a style more sexy or more aggressive 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.090
 this aggressive with a beautiful style 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.859
 elegant so if you have a below 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.380
 elegant dress with a jacket of 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.030
 leather on top is very, very good 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.950
 then something I forgot 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.739
 very important to tell you is that I have 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.349
 taken a m then the average size 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.370
 because it is the more generic one and that one 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.840
 more common then than the srl was 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.440
 the one that allowed me to go a little 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.419
 higher, however, if the winner 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.489
 when he contacts me he will tell you what he wants 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.980
 absolutely s an ale is because 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.500
 he wants to be sure he is leaving 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.440
 will try to go to the store and see of 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.139
 change it with a srl if I find it 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.360
 but in my opinion, however, iron for how 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.490
 dress should be fine 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.260
 a little bit to all of you in the sense that it's okay 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.049
 both for an s because it is not anyway 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.239
 wide m good only for an elle why 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.950
 however it is not as tight as an s is one 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.910
 m how to explain the concept of why 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.680
 I chose rehman and that's enough I am 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.680

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.420

 vests because I love this style in 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.400
 so in leather with all these deaths and 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.470
