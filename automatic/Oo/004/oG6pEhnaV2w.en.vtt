00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and there i guessing i think that's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.950 
and there i guessing i think that's
that's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.939> flag<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:21.509> no<00:01:21.720> way

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that's not a start flag there's no way

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
that's not a start flag there's no way
we're<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.799> sure<00:01:23.189> exactly<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
we're not sure exactly what it is but

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
we're not sure exactly what it is but
you<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.439> i'm<00:01:25.799> thinking<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you know i'm thinking that that is a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.510 
you know i'm thinking that that is a
graveyard<00:01:27.180> after<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.170> red<00:01:28.350> wedding<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:29.159> i
