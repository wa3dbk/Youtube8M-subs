country<00:00:09.900> lead<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> came<00:00:10.469> from<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.740> blues

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
country lead I came from a blues

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.820 
country lead I came from a blues
background<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.900> kept<00:00:13.170> seeing<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> blues

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
background so I kept seeing the blues

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.760 
background so I kept seeing the blues
pentatonic<00:00:14.519> scale<00:00:14.790> their<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:17.090> and<00:00:18.710> also<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
pentatonic scale their work and also I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.710 
pentatonic scale their work and also I
knew<00:00:20.070> my<00:00:20.340> major<00:00:21.150> scales<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.029> tried<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
knew my major scales and I tried to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
knew my major scales and I tried to
blend<00:00:28.439> them<00:00:28.590> together<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.369> get<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:30.330> if

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
blend them together to get because if

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.290 
blend them together to get because if
you<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.990> play<00:00:31.640> country<00:00:32.640> lead<00:00:32.940> guitars

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you just play country lead guitars

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920 
you just play country lead guitars
mostly<00:00:33.930> leads<00:00:34.140> towards<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.280> major<00:00:35.489> sound<00:00:35.930> but

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
mostly leads towards the major sound but

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.810 
mostly leads towards the major sound but
if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.500> take<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.309> note<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.640> note<00:00:40.820> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
if you just take it note for note it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
if you just take it note for note it's
it<00:00:42.210> doesn't<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.660> any<00:00:42.809> balls<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.950> think

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it doesn't have any balls so I think

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.650 
it doesn't have any balls so I think
what<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> players<00:00:45.000> did<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.690> they

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
what a lot of the players did is they

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.819 
what a lot of the players did is they
sort<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> outlined<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> major

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
sort of outlined some of the major

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.439 
sort of outlined some of the major
scales<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.430> instead<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:53.239> they'd<00:00:54.239> use

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
scales so instead of going they'd use

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.760 
scales so instead of going they'd use
this<00:00:54.629> instead<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.530> more

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this instead so you could get that more

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.920 
this instead so you could get that more
bluesy<00:00:59.039> ER<00:00:59.219> soon

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:18.360 

so<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.200> use<00:01:09.350> those<00:01:09.530> sort<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.860> bluesy<00:01:10.280> runs

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.790 

without<00:01:19.370> it<00:01:19.700> sounding<00:01:20.000> too<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:23.600> major<00:01:24.350> or<00:01:24.620> too

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
without it sounding too to major or too

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.070 
without it sounding too to major or too
poppy<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:26.450> sort<00:01:26.660> of<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.900> approach

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
poppy so that's sort of the approach

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080 
poppy so that's sort of the approach
I've<00:01:27.440> use<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.979> trying

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
I've use is trying

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.840 
I've use is trying
sometimes<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.840> edit<00:01:30.140> out<00:01:30.260> some<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.979> color

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
sometimes to edit out some of the color

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.030 
sometimes to edit out some of the color
notes<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:33.200> way<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.470> use<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.770> lot<00:01:34.010> of

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
notes and that way I can use a lot of

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.500 
notes and that way I can use a lot of
the<00:01:34.280> same<00:01:34.550> blues<00:01:34.940> licks<00:01:35.350> same<00:01:36.350> positions<00:01:37.510> just

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
the same blues licks same positions just

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.390 
the same blues licks same positions just
a<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.990> know<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.680> here's<00:01:39.860> your<00:01:39.950> classic

pentatonic and here's a classic major

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.100 
pentatonic and here's a classic major
now<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:47.840> felt<00:01:48.170> comfortable<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.800> blues<00:01:49.009> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.510 

you<00:01:54.110> can<00:01:54.290> basically<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.920> same<00:01:55.190> thing<00:01:55.430> in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
you can basically do the same thing in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:05.080 
you can basically do the same thing in
country<00:01:56.050> just<00:01:57.050> in<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.320> major<00:01:57.560> position<00:02:04.090> that

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
country just in that major position that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.290 
country just in that major position that
was<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:05.390> sloppy<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:10.180> obviously<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
was a little sloppy but obviously you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.449 
was a little sloppy but obviously you
have<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.510> keep<00:02:11.980> conscious<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.130> which<00:02:13.250> note

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
have to keep conscious of which note

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.820 
have to keep conscious of which note
you're<00:02:13.610> landing<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.360> blues<00:02:14.600> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.470 

so<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.890> wouldn't<00:02:19.190> land<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.880> sand<00:02:22.480> because

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
so I wouldn't land on that sand because

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.360
