facilities are absolutely smashing and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700 
facilities are absolutely smashing and
so<00:02:01.910> it's<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.300> excitement<00:02:02.840> coming<00:02:03.410> into<00:02:03.680> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
so it's this excitement coming into a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460 
so it's this excitement coming into a
hall<00:02:04.130> like<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.910> dance<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:05.510> it's<00:02:06.380> like

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.910 

I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.480> thing<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.020> love<00:02:20.230> about<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.740> is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
I think the one thing I love about it is

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.550 
I think the one thing I love about it is
the<00:02:21.100> fact<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.520> we're<00:02:21.910> all<00:02:22.180> pulled<00:02:23.050> out<00:02:23.290> of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the fact that we're all pulled out of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.840 
the fact that we're all pulled out of
our<00:02:23.800> normal<00:02:24.550> little<00:02:25.060> tiny<00:02:25.990> holes<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
our normal little tiny holes that we

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.690 
our normal little tiny holes that we
dance<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:29.590> come<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> place

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
dance in and that we come to a place

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.680 
dance in and that we come to a place
that's<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.240> special<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.790> comes<00:02:34.030> together<00:02:34.270> in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
that's so special it comes together in

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.200 
that's so special it comes together in
the<00:02:34.900> Saturday<00:02:35.290> evening<00:02:35.320> ball<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:37.000> think

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
the Saturday evening ball and I think

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.110 
the Saturday evening ball and I think
that<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.430> prize<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that is the really the prize of the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:59.289

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and then on Sunday morning is probably

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.809
