star to be this design category and so

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.500 
star to be this design category and so
now<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.550> going<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.760> jump<00:01:27.910> into<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> hardware

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
now it's going to jump into the hardware

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.240 
now it's going to jump into the hardware
category<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:29.440> gonna<00:01:29.620> start<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.010> sony

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
category it's gonna start with the sony

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.790 
category it's gonna start with the sony

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.640 
hxr DV which has a 20 times optical zoom
lens<00:01:33.190> which<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:33.670> get<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:33.909> down<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.090> F<00:01:34.450> 3.2<00:01:35.230> but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
lens which you get you down to F 3.2 but

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.930 
lens which you get you down to F 3.2 but
compare<00:01:35.980> that<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.400> Samsung<00:01:36.640> Galaxy

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
compare that to the Samsung Galaxy

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.970 
compare that to the Samsung Galaxy
camera<00:01:37.300> we<00:01:37.510> has<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.659> 21<00:01:38.200> times<00:01:38.500> optical<00:01:38.950> zoom

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
camera we has a 21 times optical zoom

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.950 
camera we has a 21 times optical zoom
lens<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:39.970> get<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.150> down<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.330> F<00:01:40.690> two

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
lens and that can get you down to F two

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.450 
lens and that can get you down to F two
point<00:01:41.260> three<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.770> cameras<00:01:42.070> should<00:01:42.310> be

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
point three so this cameras should be

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.520 
point three so this cameras should be
better<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.850> low<00:01:43.240> light<00:01:43.270> situations<00:01:44.050> but<00:01:44.409> now

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
better in low light situations but now

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230 
better in low light situations but now
when<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.710> comes<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.979> megapixels<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.640> HX<00:01:45.970> o<00:01:46.090> 2b

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
when it comes to megapixels the HX o 2b

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.730 
when it comes to megapixels the HX o 2b
does<00:01:46.540> beat<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.990> Samsung<00:01:47.290> Galaxy<00:01:47.620> camera

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
does beat out the Samsung Galaxy camera

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.320 
does beat out the Samsung Galaxy camera
by<00:01:48.010> being<00:01:48.250> able<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.520> work<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:48.790> eighteen

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
by being able to work with eighteen

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
three megapixels but now at this point

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.920 
three megapixels but now at this point
the<00:01:54.670> Samsung<00:01:54.940> Galaxy<00:01:55.210> camera<00:01:55.330> does<00:01:55.630> start<00:01:55.840> to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
the Samsung Galaxy camera does start to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to be a tricky one because both of these

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.110 
to be a tricky one because both of these
cameras<00:03:00.310> take<00:03:00.489> two<00:03:00.670> totally<00:03:01.060> different

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
approaches when it comes to software and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.530 
approaches when it comes to software and
it's<00:03:03.250> only<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.489> chess<00:03:03.730> dodaf<00:03:03.970> he<00:03:04.060> has<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.239> more

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
actually to turn out pretty good

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.000 
actually to turn out pretty good
but<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:04.930> kind<00:04:05.140> of<00:04:05.170> hard<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.440> deter<00:04:05.739> from<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
but it's kind of hard to deter from the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.380 
but it's kind of hard to deter from the
fact<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.430> Galaxy<00:04:06.820> camera<00:04:06.940> doesn't<00:04:07.239> have

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
you can see it's not really that much

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.590 
you can see it's not really that much
difference<00:04:27.610> between<00:04:27.700> these<00:04:27.970> two<00:04:28.210> pictures

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
difference between these two pictures

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.600 
difference between these two pictures
and<00:04:28.780> also<00:04:29.470> goes<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.650> same<00:04:29.950> for<00:04:29.979> this<00:04:30.220> one<00:04:30.430> for

and also goes the same for this one for

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.520 
and also goes the same for this one for
the<00:04:30.669> most<00:04:30.820> part<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.300> see<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.570> sony<00:04:31.840> HS<00:04:32.169> 33

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
the most part but you see the sony HS 33

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.760 
the most part but you see the sony HS 33
is<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.710> little<00:04:32.919> bit<00:04:33.039> more<00:04:33.220> sharper

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
is a little bit more sharper

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.800 
is a little bit more sharper
you<00:04:34.009> look<00:04:34.160> at<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.400> bricks<00:04:34.669> there<00:04:34.970> now<00:04:35.419> as<00:04:35.690> we

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
you look at the bricks there now as we

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.150 
you look at the bricks there now as we
move<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.289> next<00:04:36.379> pitches<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.860> is<00:04:36.949> one

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
move on to the next pitches this is one

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.830 
move on to the next pitches this is one
where<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.460> zoomed<00:04:37.789> all<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.030> way<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.360> with<00:04:38.660> both

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
where I zoomed all the way in with both

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.900 
where I zoomed all the way in with both

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
cameras so you can see that the Samsung

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.610 
cameras so you can see that the Samsung
Galaxy<00:04:41.300> camera<00:04:41.419> did<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.720> better<00:04:41.930> job<00:04:42.050> zoomed

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620

all the way in then the Sonia XS 30 V

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.170 
all the way in then the Sonia XS 30 V
but<00:04:45.740> this<00:04:45.860> one<00:04:46.039> seems<00:04:46.310> pretty<00:04:46.580> close<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.120> my

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
but this one seems pretty close to my

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.820 
but this one seems pretty close to my
heart<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.419> give<00:04:47.539> this<00:04:47.690> picture<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.409> the<00:04:48.560> sony

my<00:05:14.479> place<00:05:14.539> it's<00:05:15.169> doing<00:05:15.409> a<00:05:15.470> better<00:05:15.620> job<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.039> see

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
my place it's doing a better job you see

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.680 
my place it's doing a better job you see
the<00:05:16.280> colors<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.759> more<00:05:16.970> bright<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.599> vibrant

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
the colors is more bright and vibrant

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.540 
the colors is more bright and vibrant
but<00:05:18.169> as<00:05:18.289> we<00:05:18.409> move<00:05:18.560> outside<00:05:18.770> as<00:05:19.130> I'm<00:05:19.250> zooming<00:05:19.280> in

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
but as we move outside as I'm zooming in

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.830 
but as we move outside as I'm zooming in
with<00:05:19.759> both<00:05:19.909> of<00:05:20.060> these<00:05:20.150> cameras<00:05:20.509> you<00:05:20.569> can<00:05:20.659> see

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
with both of these cameras you can see

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.600 
with both of these cameras you can see
that<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.110> only<00:05:21.289> extra<00:05:21.620> star<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:22.009> is<00:05:22.310> more

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
that this only extra star to be is more

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.100 
that this only extra star to be is more
consistent<00:05:22.970> especially<00:05:23.389> with<00:05:23.750> this<00:05:23.870> focus

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
consistent especially with this focus

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.350 
consistent especially with this focus
but<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:24.979> think<00:05:25.159> as<00:05:25.310> far<00:05:25.340> as<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.639> overall<00:05:25.789> colors

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
but I think as far as the overall colors

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.640 
but I think as far as the overall colors
though<00:05:26.569> I<00:05:26.599> think<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.900> Samsung<00:05:27.259> Galaxy<00:05:27.530> camera

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
though I think the Samsung Galaxy camera

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.990 
though I think the Samsung Galaxy camera
does<00:05:27.889> do<00:05:28.039> better<00:05:28.250> zoomed<00:05:28.550> all<00:05:28.759> the<00:05:28.789> way<00:05:28.909> in

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
does do better zoomed all the way in

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.869 
does do better zoomed all the way in
just<00:05:29.630> like<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.870> did<00:05:30.020> with<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.349> pictures<00:05:30.879> and

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
just like it did with the pictures and

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.490 
just like it did with the pictures and
in<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.120> example<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.719> can<00:05:32.780> see<00:05:33.020> these<00:05:33.199> Sony

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
in this example you can see these Sony

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.140 
in this example you can see these Sony
exercises<00:05:34.069> these<00:05:34.250> videos<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.639> little<00:05:34.909> bit<00:05:35.000> more

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
exercises these videos a little bit more

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.909 
exercises these videos a little bit more
smoother<00:05:35.690> than<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.900> sampler<00:05:36.289> galaxy<00:05:36.620> camera

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
smoother than a sampler galaxy camera

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.379 
smoother than a sampler galaxy camera
and<00:05:37.219> that's<00:05:37.310> partly<00:05:37.729> because<00:05:37.819> they<00:05:38.150> can

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
and that's partly because they can

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.719 
and that's partly because they can
record<00:05:38.719> a<00:05:38.840> full<00:05:39.110> 1080p<00:05:39.440> at<00:05:39.949> 60<00:05:40.460> frames<00:05:40.669> per

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
record a full 1080p at 60 frames per

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.580 
record a full 1080p at 60 frames per
second<00:05:41.150> where<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.690> galaxy<00:05:42.080> cameras<00:05:42.409> gonna<00:05:42.500> be

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
second where the galaxy cameras gonna be

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.709 
second where the galaxy cameras gonna be
capped<00:05:42.860> off<00:05:43.039> at<00:05:43.250> 30<00:05:43.550> frames<00:05:43.909> per<00:05:44.000> second<00:05:44.419> so

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
capped off at 30 frames per second so

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.180 
capped off at 30 frames per second so
that<00:05:44.750> allows<00:05:45.110> these<00:05:45.319> so<00:05:45.469> next<00:05:45.710> restore<00:05:45.979> the<00:05:46.069> V

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
that allows these so next restore the V

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.230 
that allows these so next restore the V
is<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:46.460> want<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.699> take<00:05:46.819> the<00:05:46.940> video<00:05:47.180> and

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
is you want to take the video and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.390 
is you want to take the video and
post-processing<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.349> slow<00:05:48.949> it<00:05:49.099> down<00:05:49.130> and

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
post-processing and slow it down and

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.620 
post-processing and slow it down and
things<00:05:49.550> like<00:05:49.639> that<00:05:49.699> sort<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.090> come<00:05:50.180> out<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.330> lot

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
things like that sort of come out a lot

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.570 
things like that sort of come out a lot
better<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.169> then<00:05:51.560> what<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.860> Samsung<00:05:52.279> Galaxy

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
better and then what the Samsung Galaxy

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.490 
better and then what the Samsung Galaxy
camera<00:05:52.729> can<00:05:53.000> offer<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:54.020> again<00:05:54.229> we<00:05:54.349> can

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
camera can offer you and again we can

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.930 
camera can offer you and again we can
see<00:05:54.529> the<00:05:54.740> sharpness<00:05:55.039> into<00:05:55.340> auto<00:05:55.490> focusing

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
more consistent than the Samsung Galaxy

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.390 
more consistent than the Samsung Galaxy
