00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.100 

as<00:02:01.570> our<00:02:01.930> Neff<00:02:03.270> c-sharp<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
as our Neff c-sharp the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.390 
as our Neff c-sharp the
and<00:02:08.410> then<00:02:08.650> you<00:02:08.860> go<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.280> c-sharp<00:02:09.759> again

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.990 

they<00:02:13.030> phone

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.790 

then<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.200> e-string

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
then to that be on the e-string

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:30.690 
then to that be on the e-string
so<00:02:19.330> let's<00:02:20.330> take<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.810> back<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.990> little<00:02:21.080> bit

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:44.009 

be<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.769> flat<00:02:41.800> did<00:02:42.800> an<00:02:42.950> F<00:02:43.069> sharp

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
be you go to the a flat did an F sharp

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:57.670 
be you go to the a flat did an F sharp
so<00:02:45.160> from<00:02:46.160> there<00:02:52.780> cuz<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.019> F<00:02:56.049> did<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.200> C<00:02:57.410> sharp

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
so from there cuz that F did the C sharp

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.000 
so from there cuz that F did the C sharp
and<00:02:58.900> they'd<00:02:59.900> be<00:03:00.019> open<00:03:00.440> C<00:03:01.340> sharp<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.890> right

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and they'd be open C sharp all right

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
and they'd be open C sharp all right
I'll<00:03:04.670> say<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.910> do<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.360> bit<00:03:05.510> slower<00:03:05.780> go

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
I'll say I do a little bit slower go

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:23.310 
I'll say I do a little bit slower go
over<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:06.620> time<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.220> have
