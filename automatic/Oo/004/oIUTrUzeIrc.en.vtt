ones<00:01:31.569> that<00:01:31.780> have<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.079> craft<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.759> i<00:01:34.719> believe

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
ones that have and craft and i believe

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.289 
ones that have and craft and i believe
that's<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.890> small<00:01:36.429> fee<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:36.789> 20<00:01:37.119> bucks

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
that's just a small fee like 20 bucks

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.429 
that's just a small fee like 20 bucks
but<00:01:38.289> personally<00:01:38.740> if<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.130> has<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.549> ring<00:01:39.819> i

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
but personally if it just has the ring i

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.599 
but personally if it just has the ring i
think<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.590> should<00:01:41.619> just<00:01:41.799> go<00:01:42.189> with<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.369> two

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
think you should just go with the two
