00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.210
 the little tutorial 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.630
 in fact snatched with the means of the edge to show how to file 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.369
 a little screen protection on his phone in this case magic word 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.899
 so this case wash your hands 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.609
 I do not show you but I am 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.900
 still clean on the screen to the maximum to continue 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.980
 no bank a task 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.099
 no trace especially forgiveness 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.489
 a small cloth wolf provided with the phone should suffice 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440
 once these girls 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.170
 first phone go out 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 protection 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.750
 finally florent times advanced training 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.270
 the screen protector this project initiated in the message I received 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.990
 cinema and a little trick for school 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.350
 still 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.470
 m for the knowledge and protection of users how am I going to recover 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.410
 if the video above so then you see written in any case amanda my 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.350
 body 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.800
 as well as to head on it 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.250
 cr7 stickers for you have removed the mask on the eyes 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 the screen protector I'm here 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 it's a bet that the same thing 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 so to do it in order so we had yours 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.160
 a little late beware of pamatai others 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.320
 I think for him everything is possible 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 and in which gently deposited 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 on the court 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 more than to give up 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.050
 removed all the air bubbles 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.950
 on all their most popular outings 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.050
 I made places as decided to say it 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.780
 so what 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 an important note because that's how i 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 my previous screen protector 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.010
 be careful not to be born yet 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.489
 protection if she could not change 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 because after that it does not stick anymore 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.999
 so first miss 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.120
 if you do not leave rubble that feels like it's happening 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.980
 so besides that I made it is to sink it too close 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.619
 from the edge of the body 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.989
 think about it 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.189
 we pose it 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 pre but too much sunk 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.349
 at the edge of the wood 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.809
 here 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.729
 as for lynette 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.559
 but we start again 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.329
 less tall 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.329
 Well, it's still not aligned 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.999
 so yes it's not necessarily easy before turning on the phone in the 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.769
 meaning you want 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.129
 for ramadan 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.799
 easier this is it 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.579
 we want to remove these whores nesme 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.579

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.139

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.189

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.769
 wandering afp 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.769
 the protection of fears and that mickey the director him 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.839
 the little 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.859
 you have the soul of a well protected screen 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.059
 to fill the void I do not do the video or almost 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.529
 I'm not disappointed the label 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.590
 but why do it many times 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.590
 as you do not put your fingers on the coverslip 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.459

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.189
