00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.419
 and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.670
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.059
 realize an advent calendar done 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.969
 House 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.529
 so with 100% eco recovery so 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.410
 to realize this calendar 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.039
 we need 24 rolls of paper 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.609
 toilet and a 25th to create a 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.130
 fireplace 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.490
 we'll see a big roll later 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.830
 who will use us to draw circles 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.430
 a cardboard board covered with 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:41.199
 kraft paper a stencil with numbers 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.210
 kraft paper therefore have falls from 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.549
 cartons that will serve us to 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.690
 build the roof of the glue 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:52.600
 transparent little candies a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.909
 marker and the rounds we have 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.989
 previously cut into 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.760
 Kraft paper 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 using this circle 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.010
 we use them like those on track have 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.220
 turn to turn then we just need to 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.960
 cut out so good I 'll take a 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.430
 little piece of cardboard to serve me 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:20.050
 support and but let's draw and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:24.340
 previously prepared so with the help of 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.880
 my post war and a marker like 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 this one 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.990
 bah 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:41.260
 I will then serve myself I can choose 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 to draw a radius so that it is 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.310
 centered I go out my little gray to the magic 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:08.190
 here is a small rectangle it is enough for me 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.540
 moment of the basting of glue I 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.790
 equip me with my brush 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.079
 and we go quite generously because it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.079
 must seventh 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.590
 so we do not worry the alcohol is going 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:38.489
 become transparent to drying I'm going 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.670
 then placed but where the water like this 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:46.360
 I will wait until it dries before 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:51.120
 to add my little sweets and then 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.120
 I resort to the end with the numbers 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.970
 now that the cause is dry 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.320
 I started to browse merlot and 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.870
 integrated inside 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:15.260
 our little sweets like this one joe 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:15.260
 go around the world like this 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.999
 m 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.160
 I chose to follow the numbers on 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.670
 can also very well put them in the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 Standards 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.480
 we did a good trick 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:12.940
 and here we are glued the 24 roll 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.139
 if it only remains to build a 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.250
 roof to create a little we the 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:26.199
 others cut boards 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:30.250
 the Togolese rpt like those of 15 cm 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:34.780
 by 10 cm up in the head of your 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.740
 city ​​or coming to stick on the edges 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.740
 roads 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.139
 1 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.660
 this is our calendar is now 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.690
 completely it's how we can see 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.150
 the glue has disappeared so it has become 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.740
 completely transparent the roof and wires 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.479
 and so we just have to create the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.940
 small fireplace to complete this 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.449
 house so it's very simple we take 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.789
 the last roll of toilet paper and 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.789
 we will come cut diagonally 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.650
 I take my coll 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.440
 I use the same one even though I have 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.629
 previously used for rollers 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.500
 I thought the edges are good 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:52.250
 always generous because it becomes 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.250
 transparent 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.580
 I can also apply on the roof 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.750
 ladies 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:09.009
 so this is our house is over 

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:11.859
 our advent calendar we are going 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.249
 to be able to add a little handkerchief 

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:18.009
 the chimney to give the illusion of a 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.839
 true and now I have no more 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.859
 to call my little elves and you 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.859
 wish a very merry christmas
