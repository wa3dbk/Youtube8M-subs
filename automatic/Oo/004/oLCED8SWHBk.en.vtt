00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.589 

i'm<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> talk<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.460> red<00:00:08.820> dots<00:00:09.120> and

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
i'm going to talk about the red dots and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.789 
i'm going to talk about the red dots and
a<00:00:10.349> co<00:00:10.679> ji<00:00:10.980> sites<00:00:11.780> first<00:00:12.780> I've<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.469> bunch<00:00:13.740> of

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
a co ji sites first I've got a bunch of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.180 
a co ji sites first I've got a bunch of
images<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.630> first<00:00:15.630> set<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.619> m4a<00:00:17.039> one

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
images here first set is just an m4a one

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.939 
images here first set is just an m4a one
with<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> red<00:00:18.359> dot<00:00:18.570> sight<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.439> second<00:00:19.800> one

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
with a red dot sight and the second one

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.240 
with a red dot sight and the second one
is<00:00:20.220> an<00:00:20.490> m4a<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.890> holographic<00:00:22.890> sight

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
is an m4a one with a holographic sight

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.890 
is an m4a one with a holographic sight
now<00:00:23.730> I'll<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.970> scroll<00:00:24.210> back<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.510> forth

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
now I'll just scroll back and forth

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
now I'll just scroll back and forth
through<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.250> sort<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
through them you can see they sort of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.970 
through them you can see they sort of
have<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> same<00:00:26.939> field<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.480> view<00:00:29.330> except<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
have the same field of view except the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
have the same field of view except the
the<00:00:31.980> amount<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> black<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.090> amount<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the amount of black the amount of the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.130 
the amount of black the amount of the
black<00:00:34.020> metal<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.700> screen<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> lot

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
black metal on the screen there's a lot

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.530 
black metal on the screen there's a lot
more<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.399> holographic<00:00:39.149> sight

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
more of it with the holographic sight

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.639 
more of it with the holographic sight
and<00:00:39.750> I'll<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> next<00:00:40.559> picture<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
and I'll go to the next picture here

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.580 
and I'll go to the next picture here
halfway<00:00:43.649> its<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.899> opaque<00:00:45.899> fit<00:00:46.320> fuzzed

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
halfway its kind of opaque fit fuzzed

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.880 
halfway its kind of opaque fit fuzzed
out<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.539> I've<00:00:48.539> got<00:00:48.780> each<00:00:49.079> site<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.590> top<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
out there I've got each site on top of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
out there I've got each site on top of
each<00:00:49.980> other<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.600> fuzz<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
each other the more fuzz that one is the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.350 
each other the more fuzz that one is the
holographic<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> sort<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
holographic and you can sort of see that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.110 
holographic and you can sort of see that
it<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.050> general<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:55.860> take<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:57.059> space

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it in general it will take up more space

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
it in general it will take up more space
on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> screen<00:00:58.410> than<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> red<00:00:59.609> dot<00:00:59.820> sight<00:01:00.180> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
on the screen than the red dot sight for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.979 
on the screen than the red dot sight for
most<00:01:01.320> weapons<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.629> go<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> next

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
most weapons that is go to the next

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320 
most weapons that is go to the next
screen<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.580> i<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:05.909> side<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.150> side

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
screen here and i got them side by side

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.010 
screen here and i got them side by side
and<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.159> sort<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.840> much

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and you can sort of see how how much

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.450 
and you can sort of see how how much
space<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.710> compared<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> each

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
space they take up compared to each

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.380 
space they take up compared to each
other<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.970> looks<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.790> holographic<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
other it looks like the holographic is a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
other it looks like the holographic is a
little<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.869> lower<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.580> actual<00:01:17.580> visuals

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
little bit lower and the actual visuals

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.859 
little bit lower and the actual visuals
inside<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> visual<00:01:19.170> window<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.299> site<00:01:21.630> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
inside that visual window of the site is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
inside that visual window of the site is
a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.680> larger<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> does<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> little

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a little larger it does have a little

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
a little larger it does have a little
bit<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.780> space<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.590> however<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.759> red<00:01:27.060> dot

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
bit more space to it however the red dot

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.710 
bit more space to it however the red dot
you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you can see more around it and it's it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
you can see more around it and it's it's
still<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.140> still<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.590> close<00:01:31.770> overall<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
still it's still pretty close overall I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.990 
still it's still pretty close overall I
prefer<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> red<00:01:33.090> dot<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:35.700> another

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
prefer the red dot but another

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.980 
prefer the red dot but another
comparison<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:37.310> not<00:01:38.310> only<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.150> amount<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
comparison is not only the amount of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.310 
comparison is not only the amount of
view<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:41.840> not<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> black

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
view you can see not with the black

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.359 
view you can see not with the black
spots<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.399> actual<00:01:44.880> red<00:01:45.299> dot<00:01:46.070> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.220> look

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
spots but the actual red dot if you look

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.620 
spots but the actual red dot if you look
at<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.579> picture<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> left<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
at this picture the one on the left the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.219 
at this picture the one on the left the
holographic<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.860> got<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.460> much<00:01:50.820> wider<00:01:51.540> area

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
holographic it's got a much wider area

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.130 
holographic it's got a much wider area
on<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.680> there's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.159> red<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.140> but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
on it there's a lot more red to it but

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.090 
on it there's a lot more red to it but
it's<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> little

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's actually that is actually a little

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's actually that is actually a little
transparent<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.540> through<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
transparent and you can see through that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.899 
transparent and you can see through that
a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.200> whereas<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.189> red<00:02:02.399> dot<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.640> the

a little bit whereas the red dot on the
right<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
a white spot and you won't you won't be

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.130 
a white spot and you won't you won't be
able<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.880> see<00:02:09.030> through<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.539> dot<00:02:09.840> and

able to see through the little dot and
I'll<00:02:10.229> go<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> next<00:02:10.679> screen<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:13.459> where

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
I'll go to the next screen here where

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.390 
I'll go to the next screen here where
was<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.700> okay<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
was that okay there it is this is the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
was that okay there it is this is the
red<00:02:17.640> dot<00:02:17.880> sight<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.510> these<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.440> same

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
red dot sight and these are the same

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.040 
red dot sight and these are the same
same<00:02:20.640> same<00:02:21.800> size<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.520> red<00:02:23.730> dot<00:02:23.910> sight<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.600> as

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
same same size the red dot sight here as

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.449 
same same size the red dot sight here as
you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> takes<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.980> lot<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.130> space

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
you can see it takes up a lot of space

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.270 
you can see it takes up a lot of space
and<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.600> can't<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.260> through<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.590> as

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and you can't really see through it as

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
and you can't really see through it as
compared<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> holographic<00:02:30.420> sight<00:02:30.750> right

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
compared to the holographic sight right

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.440 
compared to the holographic sight right
here<00:02:31.140> yes<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:32.850> wider<00:02:33.239> but

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
here yes that it's a little wider but

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.600 
here yes that it's a little wider but
you<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.650> more<00:02:34.770> transparent

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
you you it's a little more transparent

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
you you it's a little more transparent
and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.270> amount<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> white<00:02:37.140> space<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
and the amount of white space is a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.820 
and the amount of white space is a
little<00:02:37.980> smaller<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:40.110> let's<00:02:40.350> go<00:02:40.470> back<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
little smaller so let's go back and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.170 
little smaller so let's go back and
forth<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.370> sort<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
forth so you can sort of see the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.979 
forth so you can sort of see the
comparison<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.410> two<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.360> which

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
comparison of the two that can is which

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.020 
comparison of the two that can is which
really<00:02:46.709> what<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.070> means<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
really what this means is the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.820 
really what this means is the
holographic<00:02:48.480> might<00:02:48.989> be<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.320> better<00:02:49.530> for

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
holographic might be a little better for

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.259 
holographic might be a little better for
picking<00:02:50.130> out<00:02:50.250> targets<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> distance

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
picking out targets in the distance

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.390 
picking out targets in the distance
things<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.870> you'll<00:02:52.830> be<00:02:52.980> able<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> see<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
things like that you'll be able to see a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.729 
things like that you'll be able to see a
little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.850> better<00:02:54.709> for<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:56.220> small<00:02:56.610> targets

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
little bit better for for small targets

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.020 
little bit better for for small targets
honestly<00:02:58.739> though<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.130> red<00:02:59.280> dot<00:02:59.489> still<00:02:59.790> works

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
honestly though the red dot still works

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
honestly though the red dot still works
fine<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.300> me<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.800> there's<00:03:02.370> also<00:03:02.670> another<00:03:03.769> red

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
fine for me but there's also another red

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.770 
fine for me but there's also another red
dot<00:03:05.069> sight<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.650> tar-21<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.489> f2000<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
dot sight the tar-21 and the f2000 have

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.170 
dot sight the tar-21 and the f2000 have
what<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.470> called<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.860> mars<00:03:11.250> site<00:03:11.670> instead<00:03:12.060> of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
what is called the mars site instead of

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.050 
what is called the mars site instead of
the<00:03:12.329> typical<00:03:13.260> red<00:03:13.709> dot<00:03:13.950> sight<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the typical red dot sight and this is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.199 
the typical red dot sight and this is
what<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.390> looks<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.850> let's<00:03:18.060> go<00:03:18.180> ahead

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
what that looks like so let's go ahead

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.199 
what that looks like so let's go ahead
and<00:03:18.360> compare<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.680> other<00:03:20.209> some

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
and compare it to the to the other some

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.460 
and compare it to the to the other some
of<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.360> red<00:03:21.480> dot<00:03:21.630> size<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.019> other<00:03:22.140> weapons

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
of the red dot size of the other weapons

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350 
of the red dot size of the other weapons
this<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> other<00:03:23.400> typical<00:03:23.700> red<00:03:24.000> dot<00:03:24.180> sight

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
this is the other typical red dot sight

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.310 
this is the other typical red dot sight
and<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.820> Mars<00:03:26.820> site<00:03:27.329> takes<00:03:27.959> up<00:03:28.170> a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and you can see the Mars site takes up a

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.940 
and you can see the Mars site takes up a
lot<00:03:28.829> more<00:03:29.340> space<00:03:29.790> black<00:03:30.150> space<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.680> lot

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
lot more space black space you see a lot

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.000 
lot more space black space you see a lot
less<00:03:32.250> around<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.030> with<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.540> with<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.200> Mars

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
less around you with this with the Mars

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
less around you with this with the Mars

great comparison you can see it had you

just a lot more clutter there whereas

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.180 
just a lot more clutter there whereas
this<00:04:51.659> is<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.169> have<00:04:52.199> one<00:04:52.500> single<00:04:52.830> line<00:04:53.009> in

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
this is you just have one single line in

this is you just have one single line in
the<00:04:53.280> middle<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.669> side<00:04:54.599> by<00:04:54.780> side<00:04:55.080> they<00:04:55.409> have

the middle and side by side they have
about<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.639> same<00:04:56.669> window<00:04:57.270> inside<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:58.139> you<00:04:58.349> but

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
about the same window inside of you but

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.520 
about the same window inside of you but
outside<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.250> Susa<00:04:59.610> has<00:05:00.000> has<00:05:00.599> any<00:05:01.020> better<00:05:01.199> view

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
and inside it has a little bit better

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.360 
and inside it has a little bit better
view<00:05:03.810> because<00:05:03.930> it's<00:05:04.139> missing<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.740> four<00:05:05.099> lines

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.930 

okay<00:05:24.470> now<00:05:24.650> we're<00:05:24.770> going<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.920> switch<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.310> an<00:05:25.490> m4

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
okay now we're going to switch to an m4

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.760 
okay now we're going to switch to an m4
with<00:05:26.060> an<00:05:26.180> AC<00:05:26.330> LG<00:05:26.780> everything<00:05:27.110> else<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.410> exactly

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
with an AC LG everything else is exactly

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.150 
with an AC LG everything else is exactly
the<00:05:27.920> same<00:05:28.360> as<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.420> previous<00:05:29.870> class<00:05:30.350> once

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
the same as the previous class once

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.860 
the same as the previous class once

again zoom in and not adjust my aim at
all<00:05:33.020> okay<00:05:34.010> as<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.820> see<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.030> has<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.180> little

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
all okay as you can see it has a little

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.990 
all okay as you can see it has a little
wider<00:05:35.660> spread<00:05:36.050> on<00:05:36.290> that<00:05:36.440> one<00:05:36.650> we<00:05:37.580> keep<00:05:37.790> doing

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
wider spread on that one we keep doing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.270 
wider spread on that one we keep doing
this<00:05:38.120> though<00:05:38.350> that<00:05:39.350> one's<00:05:39.590> shooting<00:05:40.070> up

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
this though that one's shooting up

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.780 
this though that one's shooting up
higher<00:05:40.430> ok<00:05:40.760> that<00:05:40.940> one<00:05:41.060> raised<00:05:41.600> up<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:41.900> lot<00:05:42.790> one

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
higher ok that one raised up a lot one

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.160 
higher ok that one raised up a lot one
more<00:05:43.970> time<00:05:46.300> more<00:05:47.300> spread<00:05:47.600> on<00:05:47.690> that<00:05:47.870> and<00:05:48.050> go

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
more time more spread on that and go

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.450 
more time more spread on that and go
back<00:05:48.350> to<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:49.220> m4<00:05:49.670> without<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.300> AC<00:05:50.450> oh<00:05:50.660> gee

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
back to the m4 without the AC oh gee

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:00.870 
back to the m4 without the AC oh gee
look<00:05:52.460> at<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.580> spread<00:05:55.840> still<00:05:56.840> tight<00:05:58.810> again

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
look at the spread still tight again

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.990 
look at the spread still tight again
still<00:06:01.880> small<00:06:02.210> and<00:06:04.120> one<00:06:05.120> more<00:06:05.300> time<00:06:07.000> still

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
still small and one more time still

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.910 
still small and one more time still
small<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:08.420> as<00:06:08.540> you<00:06:08.660> can<00:06:08.750> see<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:09.020> AC<00:06:09.170> og<00:06:09.620> does

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
small so as you can see the AC og does

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.190 
small so as you can see the AC og does
increase<00:06:10.730> the<00:06:11.120> recoil<00:06:11.570> it<00:06:11.750> makes<00:06:11.930> your<00:06:12.050> gun

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
increase the recoil it makes your gun

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.130 
increase the recoil it makes your gun
