I<00:02:32.620> wanted<00:02:33.129> Peter<00:02:33.340> Beardsley<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:35.349> I

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
I wanted Peter Beardsley and and I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.949 
I wanted Peter Beardsley and and I
wanted<00:02:35.860> Peter<00:02:36.069> basically<00:02:36.580> because<00:02:37.000> I've

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
wanted Peter basically because I've

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.259 
wanted Peter basically because I've
stalked<00:02:38.349> him<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.800> long<00:02:38.980> time<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.610> don't

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
stalked him for a long time I don't

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.850 
stalked him for a long time I don't
think<00:02:40.599> there's<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.840> limit<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.170> really<00:02:41.590> what<00:02:41.769> he

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
think there's a limit to really what he

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.530 
think there's a limit to really what he
can<00:02:42.040> achieve<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:43.860> he's<00:02:44.860> got<00:02:45.129> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
can achieve because he's got that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.089 
can achieve because he's got that
unknown<00:02:46.540> quality<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:47.290> qin<00:02:47.709> qiong<00:02:47.920> he

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
unknown quality with qin qiong he

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.490 
unknown quality with qin qiong he
doesn't<00:02:48.400> even<00:02:48.459> know<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.930> he's<00:02:50.080> gonna<00:02:50.230> do

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
doesn't even know what he's gonna do

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.080 
doesn't even know what he's gonna do
some<00:02:50.739> defenders<00:02:51.220> don't<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.580> anything<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
some defenders don't know anything it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.940 
some defenders don't know anything it
was<00:02:52.390> probably<00:02:52.660> ability<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.200> school<00:02:53.470> those<00:02:53.709> he

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
was probably ability to school those he

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.339 
was probably ability to school those he
thought<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> ability<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.640> micro<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:56.230> was

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
thought the ability to micro it was

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.980 
thought the ability to micro it was
caused<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.739> little
