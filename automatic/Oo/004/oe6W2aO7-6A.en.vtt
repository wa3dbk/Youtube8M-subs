00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.510
 the subject is now the car of the boat of hell 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.279
 a part of the disabled that dictates the most fun almost 500 years ago 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.889
 but which remains quite current 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.699
 the auto of the boat of hell 'what is the scenic situation that you find 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.020
 year in a certain space 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.019
 which is a people 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.099
 are stationed in which two boats 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.899
 one of them has as a helmsman one years and the other as helmsman the devil 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.119
 the boat that has an angel as helmsman goes to heaven and encompasses that there is the devil 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.040
 as a helmsman goes to hell 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.280
 air passengers of these two boats are the characters that arrive from this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.190
 embark for one with another of these boats are the souls 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.920
 it is the human souls that are Talita that has their destiny defined there 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.909
 go to heaven for the virtuous ones who have their virtues subsidized 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.250
 go to heaven for sinners who have their sins punished 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.640
 the piece therefore presents some very explicit Catholic ideologies is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.499
 very clear 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.339
 are condemned sinners according to the Catholic Church are notified 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.870
 eight years according to the catholic church 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.910
 then the piece serves as a teaching it has a rather didactic character 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.760
 accentuated 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.560
 it teaches people how they should proceed 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 to get pagode, stay for eternal life 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.390
 now what type of character appears on the scene how these characters are represented 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 sins are represented through 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.590
 the virtues 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.609
 the period in which one of the sins that each character to represent 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.770
 the characters are punished for these virtues or these more sins 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.910
 each of them also represents a title of the Portuguese society of the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.080
 early 16th century 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.359
 jaime felt a great liveliness to his piece and confers to her 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.909
 besides the religious content I do not have another sociological 21 the critic of great 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:48.560
 reach 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 precisely because it has great scope 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.939
 is a living piece still today is a current piece 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.780
 within today 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.010
 for you to have an idea 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.720
 one of the sins that are intended is not with with with the boat of hell 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.970
 it is the sin of corruption 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.430
 there is no doubt that it is a piece still today it would suffice is a piece still very 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.969
 current 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.170
 you can watch it with tranquility 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.350
 you will follow that you will understand with certainty each scene of that request. 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.299
 extraordinary 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.329
 of the 17 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.489
 most of them most of the characters and punished 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.069
 go to heaven only the knights 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.599
 those who died asking for God 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.489
 and the brown 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.740
 a man who jane 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370
 whose sins were committed without malice 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 the other shoemaker nobleman the friar so many others 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.870
 go to hell 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 which represents well 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.999
 keita most of humanity is doomed even with hell 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:39.769
 since that time
