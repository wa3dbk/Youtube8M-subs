00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
this case extended over here but you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
this case extended over here but you
know<00:02:27.209> they<00:02:27.480> leave<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.840> kind<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.319> fully<00:02:28.530> exposed

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
know they leave it kind of fully exposed

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
know they leave it kind of fully exposed
so<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.909> way<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.079> top
