00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.170
 this is the broken mirror 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.450
 no no no 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.910
 all right 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.670
 first you will have to remove this screw 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.410
 here 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.410
 Yes it feels 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.590
 and so much 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 good 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.269
 now you have to let go 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.269
 Now you have to release this screw 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 you have to release this screw 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 and these other two screws here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.970
 which they are the same 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 that those who have in the rearview mirror d 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 I must do 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 or 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.450
 yes 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.050
 we proceed in the same way with the 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.940
 two other screws 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.360
 now we have the three screws 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.560
 loose 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.560
 we can already take out 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.390
 why 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.870
 ah 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.120
 this is what comes out of the outside 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120
 of the rearview mirror 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.630
 mirror up by we discuss this by 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.630
 here 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.330
 or not 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.330
 the profession 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.500
 and now we have to press the three 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.500
 screws that we have previously loosened 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.700
 We press hard with the key and we do 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.700
 this with the three screws 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.080
 now that we have put the three 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.080
 screws 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.120
 we can put the embellisher 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.730
 which is put with a single screw 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.790
 we finished tightening the trim 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.340
 we already have the rear-view mirror placed
