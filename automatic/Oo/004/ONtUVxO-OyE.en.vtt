 Hello everyone, Vlad 205 and this is the top 10 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.189
 the freshest scientific discoveries 10th place 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.830
 It takes a universal remedy for 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.019
 depressed professor sum tanigawa after 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 numerous studies have concluded 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.029
 to maintain emotional balance 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 we need positive memories 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 ninth place 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 snake fed on the remains of dinosaurs is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.029
 an amazing find was made in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.890
 India in 1987 but personally given 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 modern technology allowed 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 determine their age equal to sixty 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 seven million were swept away by these snakes 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 dinosaurs and their cubs 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 eighth place is the gene for laughter why 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 someone has a sense of humor and someone 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 it does not turn out to be guilty genes scientists 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.550
 from the United States found that people with long 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 allele of one of the genes calmer 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 reacted to caricatures and funny 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 videos than people with a short allele addition 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.289
 same gene 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.440
 the seventh place is occupied by the magnetic sensor 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 Fields of the living organism magnet on sensory 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 animal abilities so far 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 remained unexplored until the group 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.420
 American scientists and engineers are not 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 discovered such a free-living sensor 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 nematodes 1 millimeter long this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 microscopic neural formation 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 resembles an antenna and allows worms 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.070
 move underground sixth place 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.830
 occupies a sunken antique city in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
 Crimea it comes to the city of acres once 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.119
 built coast of Kerch 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 Strait and Black Sea has no equal 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 amazing archaeological site 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.939
 According to the calculations of archaeologists are still waiting for us 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 great discoveries in these places 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.740
 the fifth place is the sixth mass 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.320
 extinction yes yes scientists have concluded 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.360
 what's happening right now is in 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 As a result of this extinction, many species 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.930
 animals may be on the verge 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.430
 extinction yes and man from this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.110
 completely uninsured 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.390
 fourth place is occupied by volcanoes on 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.760
 least another cosmic discovery 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.280
 scientists have finally received confirmation 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.090
 hypotheses about the presence of hot eruptions on 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.890
 this planet 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.270
 used a special space 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.790
 camera they found on the surface 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.740
 Venus temperature difference in four 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 places with an interval of several days 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.820
 this may indicate the presence of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.869
 large volcanoes ranked third 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.650
 undead cemetery in Sicily during excavations 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 ancient greek city in sicily 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 archaeologists stumbled upon a cemetery with 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.890
 clay tablets which were 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 written by strange spells scientists 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.970
 concluded that the Greeks were afraid that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.920
 the dead can rise from their graves here and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 sealed burial magical 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.660
 the second place is occupied by letters 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 exoplanet gleise 436 b 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.070
 this planet is located in the lion constellation 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.350
 has a gel atmosphere in solar 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.670
 there is nothing like the system though 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 other systems and in such planets 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 found in fact the whole planet glise 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 this is a piece of hot ice that is it 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.800
 frozen water that remains in 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 solid state even when 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.989
 temperature rises to 300 degrees 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.450
 first place is occupied by the mental gene 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.400
 diseases in women by an american scientist 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.590
 first managed to isolate biomarkers 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.110
 which provoke the development of mental 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.180
 diseases in women is the cause 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.310
 one genius called existential 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.810
 this is an extremely important discovery because 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.640
 further research will allow 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.920
 significantly improve therapeutic drugs 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.810
 applied psychiatric practice 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.090
 thanks for watching hope you 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.980
 liked this top with you was in 205 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.190
 bye everyone 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.019
 the planet would have overheated like venus 90 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.040
 percent of volcanoes on earth 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.040
 is under water
