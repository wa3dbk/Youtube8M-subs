to<00:02:08.840> curl<00:02:09.140> them<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.579> on<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.939> board<00:02:11.150> if

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
to curl them like just on the board if

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.390 
to curl them like just on the board if
you<00:02:11.450> want<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.469> I'm<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.680> wrapping<00:02:12.890> around

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you want to so I'm just wrapping around

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000 
you want to so I'm just wrapping around
like<00:02:13.609> that<00:02:13.819> now<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.599> can<00:02:14.840> leave<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.200> like<00:02:15.230> that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to dry but if you've got a lot to do if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.330 
to dry but if you've got a lot to do if
you<00:02:19.069> can<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.549> like<00:02:19.700> work<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.239> off<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:21.140> end

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
you can just like work it off the end

just like that and then just leave that
and<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.650> will<00:02:24.799> dry<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.400> I'm<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:25.760> it

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
and that will dry so I'm going to do it

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.460 
and that will dry so I'm going to do it
with<00:02:25.970> my<00:02:26.120> other<00:02:26.269> colors<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:26.959> get<00:02:27.079> them<00:02:27.260> all

little bit messy and with the piping gel
it's<00:03:35.540> nice<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.930> clear<00:03:36.169> and<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.949> you<00:03:37.010> can't<00:03:37.340> see

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's nice and clear and so you can't see

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.270 
it's nice and clear and so you can't see
any<00:03:38.239> mess<00:03:38.510> like<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.019> just<00:03:39.260> kind<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.099> hides

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.990 
to take one of the draws ease put a
little<00:03:54.230> bit<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.500> piping<00:03:54.919> gel<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.489> bottom

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
little bit of piping gel on the bottom

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.069 
little bit of piping gel on the bottom
of<00:03:56.419> it<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.919> put<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.900> top

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
of it and then just put it on the top

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.189 
of it and then just put it on the top
just<00:04:00.379> like<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.000> next<00:04:02.209> step<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.780> to

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
just like that so the next step is to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.949 
just like that so the next step is to
put<00:04:03.919> the<00:04:03.949> buttercream<00:04:04.549> topping<00:04:05.299> on<00:04:05.449> to<00:04:05.840> the
