00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
but what Google did today is it kind of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.749 
but what Google did today is it kind of
got<00:01:09.240> away<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.539> this<00:01:09.869> their<00:01:10.740> track<00:01:11.220> record<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759

got away from this their track record of
unveiling<00:01:12.240> whole<00:01:12.660> new<00:01:12.810> features<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.500> saying

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
unveiling whole new features and saying

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
unveiling whole new features and saying
you'll<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.360> Android<00:01:15.720> 4.3

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you'll get it when you get Android 4.3

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
you'll get it when you get Android 4.3
which<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:17.039> be<00:01:17.220> six<00:01:17.789> months<00:01:17.910> when<00:01:18.690> your

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
which could be six months when your

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
which could be six months when your
device<00:01:19.170> gets<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> could<00:01:20.039> be<00:01:20.070> until<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
device gets it or it could be until you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
device gets it or it could be until you
get<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> new<00:01:21.450> device<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.259> went<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.619> different

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
get a new device it went a different

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
get a new device it went a different
direction<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.550> makes<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.090> sense

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
direction that makes a lot more sense

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
direction that makes a lot more sense
basically<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.410> Google<00:01:25.710> did<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> sidestep

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
basically what Google did is sidestep

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
basically what Google did is sidestep
the<00:01:27.030> whole<00:01:27.270> you'll<00:01:28.050> get<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.920> it
