 never separates the minced meat is one of the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 my favorites of Brazilian cuisine and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.400
 I'm going to make a different flavor 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 like ciabatta grated with almonds 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 butter and parsley just this much 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.670

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.520
 I'll start the recipe for you crying. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 our delicious stay infallible to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.950
 superfashion triple bottom pan 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.390
 metallic black to make mincemeat that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 warm up even 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 It's going to be a show for sure. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 shine in the kitchen 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 with this double inflicted mincemeat and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.119
 perfect wedding parish 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.729
 beckham golden onion well it was to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.310
 disappear into the sauce again 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.360
 taste good sweetly medium than onion 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.619
 brings garlic to failure too 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.570
 And now it 's time for us to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.909
 put our flesh 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 This one is a mink of luxury that one 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 to impress a lot of filet mignon 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.770
 but staying right gets good from several 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.240
 beef cuts air engine and you there there 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 good 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 beyond the sea was and now that I already know 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 I'll put the tomatoes in salt cubes and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 Pepper and freshly put a 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 a little thyme and a little bit of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.539
 oregano fresh broth of beef and now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 I will make a little trick that ru 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.670
 is a blend of flour and butter 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.890
 to give a thickened in our broth is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.140
 just mix kept room temperature 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.789
 with a little flour I'm going to put 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.220
 a sip of wine that will give a 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.130
 special taste our minced fillet 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.020
 mignon is one fits very much ground 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.519
 she does not even need much cooking 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.950
 that the fabric cuts 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.920
 so if you're going to use more meat 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.350
 hard may need more cooking 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.769
 long as our stay mincemeat 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.840
 Okay, I'll prepare the farofinha. 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.840
 But now this farofa 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 Sleeping ciabatta has to keep an eye on 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.239
 in the triple pan frying pan is 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.510
 wonderful to make the streusel and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.420
 superbem heats evenly crumbly that the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 ideal is to have the whole pan in the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.519
 same temperature over there ignoring 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.250
 same and this one is special for that 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.930
 skillet plus super fashion one 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.019
 frying pan boy 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.310
 I'm going to storm our farofa. 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.680
 Paulo I'll put on the girls who already 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 laminate and toasters properly 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.730
 torradinhas who you do not want to be declared fan of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.640
 of toasted bread can be made with flour 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 cassava the same way 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.140
 same as I think the farofa 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.420
 very practical in which a loaf of bread is left 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.239
 at home that we like to make a 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.319
 gets ready very fast faroff 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.690
 stew 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.380
 It is logical that rice is important 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.310
 but without the farofa ecad is not the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.889
 same thing 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.650
 I'll put the parsley well cut 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.540
 I'm going to turn off the fire because I 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.750
 this bottomless pan and the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.400
 Wonderful, she'll finish making the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.849
 our bread 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.870
 with them off and she is 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:42.989
 very prompt and we the mincemeat too 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.099
 Look at the little bit, but not 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.220
 of May 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.739
 very time to shine the classic 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.989
 mince does not carry mushrooms but 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.470
 You want to put it on, too. 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.900
 good 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.870
 It's a lot of rice a little rice 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.010
 white only with the banana parsley 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.700
 gold breaded and wine with the yolk well 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.569
 Little ball for us to put here and give 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.569
 just a touch 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.160
