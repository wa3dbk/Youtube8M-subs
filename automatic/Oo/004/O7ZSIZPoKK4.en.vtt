you know spread the word and I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
you know spread the word and I
definitely<00:01:53.130> recommend<00:01:53.640> getting<00:01:54.149> them

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
definitely recommend getting them

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
definitely recommend getting them
because<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> sound<00:01:56.070> clarity<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
because the just the sound clarity is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.990 
because the just the sound clarity is
amazing<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.810> highs<00:01:58.200> lows<00:01:58.710> means<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.729> all

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
amazing the highs lows means they all

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
amazing the highs lows means they all
are<00:02:00.299> there<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.229> sound<00:02:01.439> amazing

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
are there and they just sound amazing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330 
are there and they just sound amazing
now<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.880> does<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.350> 120<00:02:04.350> hours<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> burn

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
now it does take 120 hours just to burn

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.850 
now it does take 120 hours just to burn
these<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> first<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.860> they're

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
these so when you first get them they're

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
these so when you first get them they're
not<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.099> sound<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:10.229> 120

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
not gonna sound as good as like 120

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.260 
not gonna sound as good as like 120
hours<00:02:11.250> later

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
of those actually owned a pair of the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.250 
of those actually owned a pair of the
tours<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.070> yeah<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.540> tours<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:46.020> better

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
tours and yeah the tours have better

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.580 
tours and yeah the tours have better
bass<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:47.280> everything<00:02:48.030> else<00:02:48.590> these

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
bass but everything else these

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.230 
bass but everything else these
headphones<00:02:49.860> beat<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.460> by<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> mile

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
headphones beat it by a mile

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.780 
headphones beat it by a mile
very<00:02:51.840> clear<00:02:52.320> they<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:53.490> come<00:02:53.640> really

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
very clear they actually come really

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.340 
very clear they actually come really
close<00:02:53.880> with<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.270> eyeties<00:02:54.750> with<00:02:54.990> sound

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
close with the eyeties with sound

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
close with the eyeties with sound
quality<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.210> wins<00:02:57.480> by<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
quality but I think this just wins by a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.740 
quality but I think this just wins by a
little<00:02:57.990> bit<00:02:58.520> also<00:02:59.520> has<00:02:59.880> great<00:03:00.120> bass<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.630> know

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
little bit also has great bass you know

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.620 
little bit also has great bass you know
it's<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:01.020> as<00:03:01.230> good<00:03:01.380> as<00:03:01.700> beats<00:03:02.700> obviously<00:03:03.390> but

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's not as good as beats obviously but

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.840 
it's not as good as beats obviously but
it's<00:03:03.780> still<00:03:03.990> there<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:05.070> get<00:03:05.220> really<00:03:05.550> deep

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it's still there you get really deep

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.120 
it's still there you get really deep
bass<00:03:06.120> really<00:03:06.900> high<00:03:07.050> bass<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.710> just<00:03:07.890> sounds

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
bass really high bass and it just sounds

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.380 
bass really high bass and it just sounds
really<00:03:08.460> good<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:09.030> you're<00:03:09.120> listening<00:03:09.240> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
really good and when you're listening to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.850 
really good and when you're listening to
it<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.720> don't<00:03:09.930> fall<00:03:10.140> out<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.290> your<00:03:10.380> ears<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
since that circle ear tip it won't fall

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.740 
since that circle ear tip it won't fall
out<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.640> your<00:03:14.760> ears<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.240> will<00:03:15.480> fit

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
out of your ears and it will fit
