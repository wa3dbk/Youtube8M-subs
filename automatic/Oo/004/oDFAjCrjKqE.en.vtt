that<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.280> legality<00:04:28.150> doesn't<00:04:28.630> actually

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
that the legality doesn't actually

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.270 
that the legality doesn't actually
affect<00:04:29.139> them<00:04:29.530> because<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.889> hasn't<00:04:30.070> been

up<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.560> do<00:04:35.620> understand<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.580> annoying

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
up I do understand that is annoying

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.279 
up I do understand that is annoying
because<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.330> card<00:04:37.630> will<00:04:37.870> lose<00:04:38.050> its<00:04:38.229> value

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
because a card will lose its value

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.620 
because a card will lose its value
therefore<00:04:38.860> if<00:04:39.370> you've<00:04:39.550> paid<00:04:39.760> out<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.360> then

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
therefore if you've paid out for it then

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.140 
therefore if you've paid out for it then
you<00:04:40.660> will<00:04:41.229> feel<00:04:41.380> hard<00:04:41.650> done<00:04:41.710> by<00:04:41.919> but<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.699> is

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
you will feel hard done by but that is

something that will always happen in the

to be accessible otherwise it's just

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.670
