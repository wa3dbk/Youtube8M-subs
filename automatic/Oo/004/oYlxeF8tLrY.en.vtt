and<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.350> every<00:01:58.350> tattoo

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
and the way I work is the every tattoo

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.499 
and the way I work is the every tattoo
has<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.310> status<00:01:59.940> story<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
has a status story and I think the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.290 
has a status story and I think the
importance<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.020> story<00:02:04.550> as<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.849> carry<00:02:06.119> on

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
importance of that story as to carry on

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.979 
importance of that story as to carry on
through<00:02:07.729> what<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.880> are<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> be

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
through what we are going to be

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.400 
through what we are going to be
tattooing<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.790> certain<00:02:12.390> sense<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
tattooing there's a certain sense of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.390 
tattooing there's a certain sense of
humility<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> integrity<00:02:15.209> when<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.569> comes<00:02:15.810> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
humility and integrity when it comes to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.820 
humility and integrity when it comes to
family<00:02:17.400> pieces<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.620> think

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
family pieces because I really think

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.330 
family pieces because I really think
that<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.880> comes<00:02:21.150> from<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> place<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.050> really

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
that it comes from a place that's really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.699 
that it comes from a place that's really
true<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.700> individual

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
