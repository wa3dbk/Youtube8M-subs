00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.280
 I lent a hand 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.280
 in the inter 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.309
 with the prize 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.659
 now I'm going to pick up the pace 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:18.039
 I will work with alex and premature 500 may be premature 500 may be 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.269
 premature 400 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.490
 writer 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 The paint 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.159
 in the thigh was committed to being built 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.159
 Mrs. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 laughs to list that everything 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 the work is well done 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.260
 of course you can 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.680
 the other two 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.200
 questioned p 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.510
 rats 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.970
 are there today 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 in training 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 I fish 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.170
 Too bad you do not 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.450
 fucile ruben 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 the placebo effect would be suffocated 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.760
 if these price indices 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.910
 The secret to winning 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.980
 it's the combination then 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.950
 giving the ink 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 a list with appropriate 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.470
 so why not have 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.450
 this list 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.330
 here was no chance to have your visa 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.710
 You can use 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.110
 still with pain she discovered my 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.540
 so much to mark 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 but the value for money is worth it because it lasts very little 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 I have another line of 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 there is not 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.760
 there is another list that she 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.840
 is a team is not ready questioned this afternoon 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.760
 the meeting ends today the period of construction 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.369
 on a water list 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.969
 and ready 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.779
 why 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.829
 a 4 5% earthquake in 2012 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.719
 the test 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.049
 in this result 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 This one is cooler because it has an estimated cost. 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 she lasts a lot the talent gallant so short 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.199
 she reveals 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.709
 the work ends up yielding more and being more pleasurable there then it is the type of 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 worthwhile investment 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.359
 cost-effective is not just an alert. 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.959
 now focuses first hand given given a list 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.309
 one more badness I think so 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.519
 was achieved 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.269
 if you can achieve the desired effect 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 bus - tevez team 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.699
 without growth 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.699
 while the neighbor of 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.009
 castellan who is afflicted 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.259
 in the dryer drying area is found to have accelerated the vehicle 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.749
 I'm not a politician 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.749
 thiago fagundes 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.789
 the pyramid has been to prevent this manufacturing process from being banned 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.119
 peter parker in the number of women that natural growth 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.049
 let it dry 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.839
 and we stop at the beach the desired effect I already have to go 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.099
 another tip that Thursday 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.309
 is the following I make the amount of ink that we use here to 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.429
 carry a sip 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:08.769
 so it stays like this is a color that I use a lot the 115 we will use this project 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:17.259
 located at 75 free places in each community will want to do what he 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.680
 wanted the normal in the world 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 anything 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 it lasts quite small 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.039
 Let's wait and with a stock loading 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460
 if you want 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.580
 I can leave the day as long as I can. 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.039
 the car is that I can leave days so the shy one but here it will have 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.039
 loaded like it was a career but at the time I want it 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.490
 and the judoka is created 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.029
 the goalkeeper quim 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.120
 the rescuer was positive 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.520
 even because I use the text a lot 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.520
 I have a line so equipped so today 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.139
 which makes it much easier
