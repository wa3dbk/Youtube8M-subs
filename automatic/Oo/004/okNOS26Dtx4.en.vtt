00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 after being delighted in the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 preparation of the velvety top today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.110
 harvey gaping and preparing 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 together with you a delicious mozzarella 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 vegan it is a kind of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.039
 one hundred percent cheese but vegetable 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 therefore naturally cholesterol free 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.960
 and dilatory that you can safely 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 replace the classic mozzarella di 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 cow milk 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.420
 the consistency as well as 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 the appearance of the perfume is approaching 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 very much to the original version 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 animal, however, clearly the preparation 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.579
 of vegan mozzarella is much more 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 simple and much faster 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.940
 Let's find out together to prepare a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 vegan mozzarella 50 g of are needed 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 cornstarch or potato starch 70 g 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.170
 of natural soy yogurt a pinch 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.070
 of salt 4 tablespoons of seed oil of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 corn and 60 milliliters of soy milk 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 not sweetened plus two tablespoons then vi 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.460
 I will explain better 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.860
 then I thought about doing some sort of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 caprese then to accompany the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.400
 I suggest you vegan mortadella 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.640
 a few leaves of fresh basil 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.350
 some tomatoes about 50 grams a little 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.290
 of pepper and a pinch of salt and oil 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 extra virgin olive oil as required vi 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.090
 remember that among the ingredients I have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 said 60 milliliters of soy milk more 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.369
 2 tablespoons because plus two tablespoons 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.009
 because we will use them to prepare a 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.200
 kind of vegetable cream then in a 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:37.439
 becker we put two tablespoons of milk of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.930
 so soy and 4 tablespoons of seed oil 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.259
 of corn so we practically do one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.079
 sort of vegan mayonnaise and mustard absence 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.870
 without monet clearly and if we create 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.390
 in all with our mixer 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.729
 see we made a vegan cream 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.090
 rather fluid, however, is fine with me 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.680
 because some vegan recipes suggest 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.660
 the for the vegan mozzarella clearly 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.360
 suggest the addition of margarine 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.140
 only that I don't particularly like 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.720
 then use margarine 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.820
 I prefer cream and I prefer it 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.100
 clearly the cream you can too 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.790
 buy the revolt vegan cream from 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.310
 bring now how to make mozzarella in 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:25.459
 a small saucepan we put the rest 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.100
 then soy milk and cornstarch then 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 we begin to mix with ours 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.930
 but fort we mix well 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.750
 initially we will meet gods 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.610
 grumetti but it is normal then the denato of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.239
 corn starch and not particularly 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.230
 problems with our compound ok very well 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:51.590
 so now let's add our yogurt to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.560
 soy that I did just yesterday therefore 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.530
 natural soybean out is fine here 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.049
 in a sweet here I have tried 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.989
 even once to prepare the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.790
 vegan mozzarella with yogurt alla 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.250
 vanilla and also with soy milk 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.400
 to the vanilla I will say that it is not really 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.989
 so wicked as to taste others maybe 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.549
 I recommend you try this either 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:20.079
 evasion is the version with the suitcase 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.079
 vanilla now a little salt 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.069
 and our cream produced car 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:37.120
 ok always stirring 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.910
 let's go on the fire let's light a flame 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.550
 moderate and never tire of 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.290
 mix I recommend it because then 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.580
 something strange will happen 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.130
 I anticipate you a little will start to form 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.739
 of the municipalities but I recommend not 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.269
 get tired, keep stirring all the time 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.600
 in the meantime you will also have to 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:02.019
 change me just this by using 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.900
 fort then you will see that it will begin to 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.989
 form a dense mass and it will change 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.720
 precisely tool to mix on cd 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.730
 it will be a simple spoon indeed you see 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.700
 that the cockerels are already forming 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.070
 after a few moments and it's one thing 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.260
 normal because if they have to form these 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.840
 names because then mixing so much yes 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.180
 melt 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 don't worry so keep going 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.560
 always stirring continuously 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.070
 up to form a ball 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.530
 here you see that it is lowering the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 our compound can now be lowered 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.740
 also the flame always continue to 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 mix it this way until 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 you see that it is breaking from the walls 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.700
 now we always continue to cook for 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.220
 another 30 seconds to make sure that 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.960
 also the cornstarch is cooked perfectly 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.680
 now we have taken it out of the fire we are 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.950
 a little bit still working in none 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.360
 meanwhile also equipped with gloves 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.630
 because then I will also go to help me with 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.700
 hands I prepared one here 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.380
 small bowl in an hour even a 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.850
 allied with a little bit of corn oil 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.979
 now we can also take ours 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.800
 mozzarella with mittens so there 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.530
 we forget even begin to give the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.060
 round shape of a mozzarella 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.090
 and we put it in here and there 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.219
 we press a little wait a couple of 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.499
 minutes then we buy it with the film 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.479
 transparent we leave completely 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.580
 cool for about an hour or two 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.659
 first room temperature then in 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.969
 refrigerator after a couple of ears of 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.590
 let's go to the cutting of the refrigerator 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.189
 mozzarella because I show you the 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.960
 consistency is very similar you see a 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.819
 that of a mozzarella mozzarella 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.699
 classic maybe the mozzarella one for 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:05.430
 pizza nears particularly see 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:07.979
 also to the cut I here I am then 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.110
 also prepared some fresh basil 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.879
 it was also a little bit the tomatoes for 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.310
 do as I said before a caprese 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.139
 so now we always pay in slices 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.439
 our mozzarella then we assemble the 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.879
 everything and let's serve the look 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.710
 extremely inviting 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.120
 here is perhaps the only factor that a 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.909
 a little bit penalizes our mozzarella 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.529
 vegan and its inability to spin 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.060
 of the preparation is 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.650
 completely different from those in 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.529
 genus is used for preparation 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.389
 of mozzarella of animal origin 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.029
 well but it doesn't matter that 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.589
 this mozzarella eaten so cold 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.000
 therefore in accompaniment with gods 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.250
 cherry tomatoes with basil 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.960
 or why not also on the track for 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.189
 me it was a real find that 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.189
 sincerely recommend
