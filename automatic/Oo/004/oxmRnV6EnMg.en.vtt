00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.860
 for this run you use the 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.570
 crochet needle 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.720
 Here I am going to work with the Japanese screen 3 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.380
 mm 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 okay you will also need a 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.230
 upholstery to make the seam this 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.410
 needle has no jewelry tip 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.079
 you will need satin ribbon on the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.960
 Diameter as you have what you want 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.260
 here I will use the red because the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.679
 tone of the movie I will use is also 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.420
 red and the movie here I'm going to use the 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:50.890
 supreme magic and we will perform the piece 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.719
 with about 2 novellus the tone is red 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510
 and mexico with a white 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.030
 Let's start our execution so you 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.909
 should start its implementation with the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.809
 chain cord that has the 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.390
 half the person's hip diameter 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.479
 so if you have the hip of 100 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.560
 centimeters your cordon cord 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:18.189
 should be 50 centimeters long 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.090
 just measure yourself to get the size 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.659
 It is necessary to touch my cord. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.640
 started with 75 chains in the case 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.520
 independent of the size of chains 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 you start at the end you add 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.759
 to three more 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:41.200
 so see here a couple of failed here 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.320
 speaking before e3 laci and pass the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.390
 needle by last by last stitch 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.520
 by the last chain had before 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.520
 Of those three you made the youngest 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.219
 jewelry then passes the needle through it and I go 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 make a high point 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:04.210
 here's a loop again and the next 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:09.160
 point make a point tie back to the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.850
 next point the point here are the people 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.269
 again a high point and so I go 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.280
 execute successively to the end 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.350
 of my first career after the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 end of the actress 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.250
 was the entire career run on points 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.770
 you should make a two 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 three chains to turn your 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 job 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.140
 laci and now you will always work from 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.870
 following two high points caught 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.840
 two high points caught by 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.160
 behind you will always work in this 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.560
 proportion 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.610
 then the first point is already counted as 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.250
 a high point 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 I'll run one more in one of the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.270
 proportions 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.150
 so look at the needle in the front plays 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.030
 back and back, look what 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.610
 happened to the point he stayed on the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.910
 needle there make a handle on the needle there 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.470
 if it's all over again two over there again 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.470
 Finish 2 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.490
 here you would then have already two points 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.570
 high 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.050
 I have to reverse the tie shape I have. 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.740
 I go back and go back 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.010
 behind pulls thrown out 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.210
 there only two bond Remato points arremato 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.210
 two stitches again needle loop is 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.710
 go back and go back 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.020
 pulls a thrown out 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.700
 lace and concludes two points and tie 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.210
 get two points 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.330
 then I would have two points run in the 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.440
 front two points taken behind 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.200
 again there is your needle in front and it goes 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.500
 back and forth 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.470
 pull suitcase know with new loop Remato 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.640
 two points released 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.430
 two again there his needle in front and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.930
 go back and go back 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.810
 pull a loop and loop 2 loop and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.440
 two little drawing eyes that go 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.140
 forming now is behind needle for 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.110
 behind come on and back 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.560
 pull thrown out 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.440
 tie and jackets 2 tie and jackets 2 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.160
 again 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.490
 I know there will come back needle forward and 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.430
 back pull pulls thrown out 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.670
 tie and jackets 2 tie and jacked two 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.720
 eyes there we 're working now 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.940
 point bar two by two manholes or 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.850
 run this entire my career 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.240
 This way and at the end I go back here 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:05.730
 to start and continue with the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 next career here with you well 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.710
 then the second career of the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.110
 our execution and you already see that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.180
 It forms an important look that gives lie 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.900
 to see well seeing relief 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.140
 ok, in continuity you will then do a 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.290
 two and three chains to turn the 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.360
 work there if it is now that you have to 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.580
 be careful because it 's because you have 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.890
 that keeping the drawing is not just about going 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.990
 picking up the front or behind the way 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.090
 who gives in the tile you have to follow the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.110
 What did you do in your previous career? 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.980
 so being I have this point looks 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.860
 here o 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.419
 on this side he's picking up from behind 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.730
 so what I'm going to do 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.180
 the needle back comes the preferred one 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.530
 I go back pull pulls thrown out 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:00.580
 I only got two las and got 2 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.250
 I kept the drawing there steel and again I 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.040
 I have a point that's behind then. 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.310
 needle behind looking forward and back 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.040
 back tie and pull out 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.919
 I only got two bows. 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:21.460
 look there the drawing that is holding 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:23.680
 rock tie is ahead so needle 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.130
 Forward Go back and back to 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.010
 front and make my point there if again 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.230
 keeps the needle drawing in front goes 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.500
 back and forth 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.800
 I'm going to make my point, it's people. 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.520
 in continuity we must perform in a 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.970
 total of six careers this way we 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.240
 We're in the third I'm going to perform. 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.759
 all 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.259
 I had six rows and in the end I go back 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.259
 here to continue with you
