 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 dear spectators salam and the peace 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.190

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.870
 time fell viking in England a 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 they looted put the region as 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.949
 churches and houses in fire and wanted 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 to keep the area under your control 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.560
 the king alfred who was alive at the time 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.490
 drive you to the country one thing 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 he had to be closed himself every day 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.119
 disguised as a normal 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.369
 leaving tramps 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.090
 At that time also lived a shepherd named 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.360
 ulfried and freak loved his king 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.940
 because his king was just and good 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.410
 the shepherd unfried he took his king 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.289
 because on the he was accommodated 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 granted in hospitality the king 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.960
 set all the time there and just thought 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.520
 about how he is his country and his 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 save people again 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 especially from the hands of the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.059
 enemies 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.799
 but the woman did not realize it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 the wife of the shepherds even realized 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.510
 not and did not know that she 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 she was angry with the king 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.950
 about him because he sits around it and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.280
 nothing is doing 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 but one day when she drifted too far 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.810
 and got angry about him too much 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.470
 her husband interrupted her and screamed 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 noisy woman you do not recognize 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.860
 that you are dealing with this in the king 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.630
 story my dear spectator 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.539
 reminds me of the story 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.840
 from christmas the christmas story 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.590
 which for many sounds incredible god 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.060
 man becomes our world 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.270
 this story my dear spectator 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.340
 is not a human idea, the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.670
 not the Christians have devised 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.149
 they did not come up with any people 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.429
 but God himself made sure that he 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.670
 comes to us 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:11.470
 In the beginning he sent many prophets 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.370
 prepare us for the way for him 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.849
 but the truth that God becomes to us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.459
 god has come before but 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.430
 hundreds of years through kings and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.160
 already announced by prophets already 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.019
 a prophet called Isaiah in the old 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.040
 Testament in the Bible has that 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.160
 announced in chapter 7 verse 14 means 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.970
 that's why the Lord himself will be one 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.700
 give a sign see the virgin will 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.799
 get pregnant and give birth to a son 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.590
 and will give it the name Emmanuel 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.670
 God himself becomes a sign for that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.450
 people by coming to us and becoming them 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.540
 immanuel immanuel hot is my 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.680
 dear god with us god 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.670
 itself becomes human and that means that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.040
 after the god spoken by prophets 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.150
 has sante god 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.780
 a son in Hebrew 1 states after 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.269
 God varied in times past 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.359
 and many on loan to the fathers 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.819
 He has spoken through the prophets 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.829
 talked to us in these last days 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:37.040
 by the son my dear spectator 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:41.870
 God spoke through many prophets he 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.569
 Sent when the time came 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:51.669
 God dressed up in shape 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:56.840
 a man he came to jesus christ 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:58.220
 and god lived in jesus christ 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.159
 among the people 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.150
 and then it says the light was in 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:08.239
 our world in the dark world and the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.079
 darkness and the darkness recognized 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:17.150
 not at all that you are there with god the light 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:20.329
 This truth describes how to do that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:25.610
 bible further in the narrative neither chapter 9 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:29.150
 from verse 5 because a child was born to us 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.060
 a son is given to us and the 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.500
 domination rests on his shoulder and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.229
 his name is called wonderful 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.039
 Counselor strong god eternal father peace 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.760
 princely these qualities and these 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.090
 designation toll on 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.820
 they are only transferable to Jesus 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.670
 Christ who lived among the people 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:00.430
 and they recognized me that they were there 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.860
 god in manuel have to deal with every child 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.600
 comes in this world is born to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 Life 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.240
 but Jesus Christ comes into our world 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.810
 to die 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:18.140
 not because he does not like death so much 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.840
 like a jihadist dies with the 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.520
 hope kills with hope 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.160
 to get into the paradise 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.480
 he does not need that, my dear 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.910
 spectator because we are both dead 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.740
 separated forever from god spiritually dead 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.380
 Jesus Christ came into our world 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.990
 shone as the true light as that 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.350
 light of the world in our dark world 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:50.060
 so that you and I can see so you 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:54.500
 and i can say god is godforsaken 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.260
 with us dear spectators how it looks 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.940
 with year like you have so far 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.030
 Christmas celebrated 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.090
 Christmas will not be different 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.860
 Christmas is not a day in the year 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.870
 he does not follow days and not 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.750
 crescent but we track around 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.950
 follow a person 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:22.520
 Christmas is where you celebrate Jesus 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:25.460
 and quite through the year 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.200
 history sounds incredible but she 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.780
 is 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.010
 not in my opinion 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.120
 unbelievable because it is too heavy 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.370
 but because she does not let her normally 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.440
 is not normal because she has nowhere to go 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.130
 find the king is himself 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.620
 becomes human and comes into our world 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:50.590
 because he wants to save you and me 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:54.430
 I do not wish you a blessed one 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.730
 normal christmas but a new one 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.940
 christmas from this year that you jesus 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.640
 God can celebrate in your heart 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.070
 the powerful god can be born like that 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.270
 he will become small in your heart 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:12.550
 is born and out of your heart can 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.620
 God's house and thus I wish 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.800
 God bless you and I wish you one 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.460

 happy New Year 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.889
 because I'm afraid that you go back to the old one 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.830
 furniture slips into it 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.460
 I wish you that in gotham 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.460
 slips
