key

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
key

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.279 
key
sits<00:01:15.590> nicely<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.729> its<00:01:16.880> slot<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.959> model

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
sits nicely in its slot this this model

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.739 
sits nicely in its slot this this model
also<00:01:18.469> has<00:01:20.889> the<00:01:21.889> climate<00:01:22.249> control<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.509> looks

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
also has the climate control it looks

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.639 
also has the climate control it looks
busy<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.499> and<00:01:25.240> complicated<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.990> think

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
busy and and complicated but I think

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.550 
busy and and complicated but I think

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.040 
actually driving a manual car it's weird
they're<00:02:11.530> too<00:02:11.680> hard<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.010> explain<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.930> know

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
they're too hard to explain but you know

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.550 
they're too hard to explain but you know
now<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.410> accelerating<00:02:14.740> through<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.490> gears

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
now I'm accelerating through the gears

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.590 
now I'm accelerating through the gears
and<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> feels<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.910> I've<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:19.480> my

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and it it feels like I've just put my

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.180 
and it it feels like I've just put my
foot<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> clutch<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> then<00:02:20.860> change

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
foot in on the clutch and then change

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.850 
foot in on the clutch and then change
that<00:02:21.490> into<00:02:22.180> third<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:22.900> back<00:02:23.140> into<00:02:23.440> second

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that into third are now back into second

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.590 
that into third are now back into second
the<00:02:24.340> other<00:02:24.370> thing<00:02:24.730> about<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.090> cell<00:02:25.330> spoon

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the other thing about this cell spoon

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.080 
the other thing about this cell spoon
which<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.710> not<00:02:27.220> only<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.700> know<00:02:27.730> far

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
which I like is it not only you know far

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.290 
which I like is it not only you know far
improved<00:02:28.690> from<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.250> 156<00:02:30.250> model<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.150> can

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
improved from the 156 model you can

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.780 
improved from the 156 model you can
actually<00:02:31.630> stick<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.020> sport<00:02:32.320> mode<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.830> have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
actually stick it in sport mode and have

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.110 
actually stick it in sport mode and have
a<00:02:34.030> full<00:02:34.300> manual<00:02:34.750> operation<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.010> I've<00:02:36.820> put<00:02:37.030> it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
a full manual operation so I've put it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.670 
a full manual operation so I've put it
back<00:02:37.240> into<00:02:37.390> second<00:02:37.900> now<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.140> then<00:02:38.260> let's<00:02:38.380> give

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
back into second now and then let's give

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.170 
back into second now and then let's give
a<00:02:38.710> bit<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.040> squirt<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.520> see<00:02:39.700> what<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.910> sounds

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
a bit of a squirt and see what it sounds

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180 
a bit of a squirt and see what it sounds
like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
a half thousand revs enough for a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
a half thousand revs enough for a
four-cylinder<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.170> pretty<00:03:08.380> good<00:03:08.650> so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
four-cylinder that is pretty good so

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.580 
four-cylinder that is pretty good so
again<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:10.630> accelerating<00:03:11.230> through<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
again just accelerating through the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.980 
again just accelerating through the
gears<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.850> changing<00:03:13.330> up<00:03:13.480> into<00:03:13.750> third

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
gears you know changing up into third

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.570 
gears you know changing up into third
and<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.530> very<00:03:14.770> nice<00:03:15.040> very<00:03:15.510> very<00:03:16.740> precise<00:03:17.740> very

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
and a very nice very very precise very

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.670 
and a very nice very very precise very
accurate<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.300> also<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.750> can<00:03:19.930> run<00:03:20.110> this<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.320> a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
accurate and also you can run this in a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.160 
accurate and also you can run this in a
sports<00:03:21.130> mode<00:03:21.520> which<00:03:22.240> probably<00:03:22.810> would<00:03:23.020> be<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
sports mode which probably would be a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.690 
sports mode which probably would be a
little<00:03:23.260> bit<00:03:23.530> frightening<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.280> what<00:03:24.520> I'm<00:03:24.580> going

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
little bit frightening so what I'm going

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.070 
little bit frightening so what I'm going
to<00:03:24.730> do<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.090> gonna<00:03:25.180> drop<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.720> back<00:03:25.840> into

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
to do is just gonna drop it back into

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.270 
to do is just gonna drop it back into
normal<00:03:27.040> drive<00:03:27.340> mode<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:32.020> in<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.040> way<00:03:33.220> you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
normal drive mode and in this way you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.640 
normal drive mode and in this way you
can<00:03:33.610> not<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.540> worry<00:03:34.900> about<00:03:35.110> changing<00:03:35.380> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
can not have to worry about changing and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.320 
can not have to worry about changing and
manual<00:03:35.950> obviously<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.670> does<00:03:36.880> give<00:03:37.210> you

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
manual obviously but it does give you

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.780 
manual obviously but it does give you
the<00:03:37.420> sensation<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:38.950> are<00:03:39.250> driving<00:03:39.610> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
the sensation that you are driving a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.240 
the sensation that you are driving a
manual<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:40.450> an<00:03:40.780> automatic<00:03:41.230> version<00:03:41.860> and

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
manual in an automatic version and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.400 
manual in an automatic version and
that's<00:03:42.430> that's<00:03:42.670> why<00:03:43.000> they<00:03:43.210> sell<00:03:43.450> speed<00:03:43.810> I'm

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
that's that's why they sell speed I'm

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.610 
that's that's why they sell speed I'm
quite<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> fan<00:03:45.070> because<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:46.060> does<00:03:46.420> appeal<00:03:46.990> to

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
quite a fan because it does appeal to

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.680 
quite a fan because it does appeal to
the<00:03:47.710> person<00:03:48.040> who<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:48.190> doesn't<00:03:48.730> want<00:03:49.570> a
