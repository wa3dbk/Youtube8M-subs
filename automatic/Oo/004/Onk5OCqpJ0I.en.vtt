00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.210
Shallow Man I really need your help.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.170
I've been living here in the Netherlands for
three years and I still don't have a single

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.110
Dutch female friend.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.709
I'm learning Dutch, I can ride my bike, it
is niet leuk that I still don't have a friend

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.070
that's female and Dutch.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.130
Expat Lady thank you for sharing your tale
of woe with me, but actually the solution

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.109
to your problem is quite simple.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.759
Dutch women really don't like it when expats
come here and dress in a feminine manner so

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.660
what you need to learn is how to dress just
like a Dutch girl which I the Shallow Man

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200
will teach you.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.230
Alright Shallow Man tell me what I gotta do.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.010
Ok so the first thing is that you're wearing
far too much make up.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.239
Too much makeup?

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.690
This is normal.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.969
Really?

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.379
Well let me tell you this is where your wrong.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.750
Dutch men absolutely do not like women that
wear too much makeup, and too much makeup

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.130
is actually any makeup at all.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.830
Dutch men and Dutch women prefer the natural
look, so I'm going to show you how to look

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.020
just like a Dutch woman.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.910
So the first step is with makeup.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.730
Ok I'll see what I can do.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.390
No there's still way too much makeup.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.260
Doe maar normaal!

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.620
Are you absolutely sure this is right?

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.330
Go for it come on.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.930
Ahh the natural look.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.150
Perfect!

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.410
Firstly well done, you've actually passed
the first test which is now you've got the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:56.400
natural look, but the other problem is you're
wearing a dress and high heels, both of which

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.250
are just not on.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.310
If you want to make friends with Dutch women
you've got to wear jeans or leggings.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.429
So this is the next phase of what we need
to do is get you in leggings.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.670
How's this?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.510
Excellent, really good, I see you're wearing
leggings, but Shallow Man, you do know that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.290
leggings are not pants right?

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.879
In most countries in the world you'd be correct,
but in the Netherlands leggings are definitely

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.459
to be worn as pants.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.129
So the most important detail to remember when
wearing leggings is that your panties must

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.920
be visible so can you turn round please?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.349
Yup I think you could have tried harder but
yes I can clearly see your panties through

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.349
the leggings.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.400
Ideally they should be granny panties or white,
but this will do.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.370
Very well done.
