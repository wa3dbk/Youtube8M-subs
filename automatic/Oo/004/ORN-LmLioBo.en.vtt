blue<00:01:01.199> eyes<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:04.640> yeah<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
blue eyes as well so yeah this one is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.410 
blue eyes as well so yeah this one is
I've<00:01:06.780> ever<00:01:07.049> stood<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.380> brandy<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.240> quite<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I've ever stood on my brandy I quite a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
I've ever stood on my brandy I quite a
orange<00:01:10.020> tones<00:01:10.320> bronzy<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.159> makes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
orange tones bronzy I because that makes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
orange tones bronzy I because that makes
a<00:01:11.430> part<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> had<00:01:13.229> green

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a part be even more so if you had green

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
a part be even more so if you had green
eyes<00:01:13.890> you'd<00:01:14.460> follow<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> through<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.869> purple

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
eyes you'd follow it through to purple

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
eyes you'd follow it through to purple
so<00:01:16.560> purple<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:17.340> complements<00:01:17.790> green<00:01:17.970> eyes

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so purple really complements green eyes

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
so purple really complements green eyes
gonna<00:01:18.420> make<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.689> part<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> also<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> use

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
on a texture but and this is a kind of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:38.870 
on a texture but and this is a kind of
