science woman my mind went immediately

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.589 
science woman my mind went immediately
to<00:00:10.260> Marie<00:00:10.590> Curie<00:00:10.920> but<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.700> thought<00:00:12.090> well<00:00:12.300> why

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
to Marie Curie but I thought well why

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.120 
to Marie Curie but I thought well why
don't<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.230> little<00:00:13.469> more<00:00:13.590> research<00:00:13.769> on

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
don't I do a little more research on

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.099 
don't I do a little more research on
some<00:00:14.400> modern<00:00:14.880> science<00:00:15.210> women<00:00:15.509> find<00:00:15.780> some<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
some modern science women find some of

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590

the<00:00:16.289> popular<00:00:16.890> women<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.880> science<00:00:18.060> working

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the popular women in science working

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
the popular women in science working
today<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.680> kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> hoping<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.279> would

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
today and I was kind of hoping it would

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
today and I was kind of hoping it would
come<00:00:20.609> across<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:21.710> like<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> cool<00:00:24.230> face<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
come across like like a cool face of
women<00:00:25.800> science<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.519> sort<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> Bill

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
women science like sort of like a Bill

but<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.220> girl<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.300> could<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.109> find<00:00:31.500> any

mean<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.250> don't<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.489> bill<00:00:36.149> 9<00:00:36.360> science<00:00:36.930> guy

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
mean we don't have bill 9 science guy

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.619 
mean we don't have bill 9 science guy
and<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> tragedy<00:00:38.969> there<00:00:39.180> isn't<00:00:39.570> really

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and that is a tragedy there isn't really

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.410 
and that is a tragedy there isn't really
like<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.930> rockstar<00:00:40.820> scientist<00:00:41.820> role<00:00:42.059> model<00:00:42.390> for

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
like a rockstar scientist role model for

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
like a rockstar scientist role model for
girls<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.410> part<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.340> comes<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.820> just

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
girls and part of that comes from just

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.450 
girls and part of that comes from just
not<00:00:45.360> having<00:00:45.930> enough<00:00:46.230> girls<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> STEM<00:00:47.309> careers

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
not having enough girls in STEM careers

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
not having enough girls in STEM careers
there<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.329> tons<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.870> women<00:00:48.989> working<00:00:49.289> in

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there are tons of women working in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
there are tons of women working in
science<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.280> need<00:00:50.610> twice<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.570> many<00:00:51.930> three

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
science but we need twice as many three

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
science but we need twice as many three
times<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.649> many<00:00:52.770> four<00:00:53.039> times<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.399> many<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.000> need

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
times as many four times as many we need

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
times as many four times as many we need
to<00:00:54.480> give<00:00:54.629> girls<00:00:54.809> role<00:00:55.289> models<00:00:55.710> and

to give girls role models and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
to give girls role models and
encouragement<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.360> show

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
encouragement so that when they show

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
encouragement so that when they show
interest<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.199> STEM<00:00:58.440> careers<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.010> early<00:00:59.280> age

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
interest in STEM careers at an early age

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
interest in STEM careers at an early age
they<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> real<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
they know that this is a real and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
they know that this is a real and
tangible<00:01:02.430> career<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
tangible career for them one of the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
tangible career for them one of the
reasons<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.530> super<00:01:04.860> excited<00:01:04.949> about<00:01:05.220> science
