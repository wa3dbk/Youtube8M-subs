00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.530 
speaking then I was like my brain was
going<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.710> don't<00:01:25.130> think<00:01:25.310> my<00:01:25.370> mouth<00:01:25.640> was<00:01:28.540> so

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
going but I don't think my mouth was so

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.510
