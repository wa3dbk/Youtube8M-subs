00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.340 
barely remember times of going out and
like<00:01:59.090> battling<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.720> trick<00:01:59.990> or<00:02:00.200> like

like battling that trick or like

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.140 
like battling that trick or like
thinking<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.860> stuff<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.250> had<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.490> do<00:02:01.880> or<00:02:02.030> like

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
thinking of stuff I had to do or like

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.020 
thinking of stuff I had to do or like
wanted<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.660> do<00:02:02.810> was<00:02:03.110> just<00:02:03.290> basically

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
wanted to do was just basically

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.910 
wanted to do was just basically
sessioning<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.240> like<00:02:06.020> capturing<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.740> like

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
sessioning and like capturing it like

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
sessioning and like capturing it like
naturally<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:11.830> think<00:02:12.830> marks<00:02:13.190> always<00:02:13.520> had<00:02:13.730> like

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
naturally I think marks always had like

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.790 
naturally I think marks always had like
a<00:02:14.000> real<00:02:14.300> vision<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.110> doing<00:02:15.470> stuff<00:02:15.620> that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
a real vision of like doing stuff that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.980 
a real vision of like doing stuff that
was<00:02:16.070> going<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.640> different<00:02:17.120> laying<00:02:17.720> down

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
was going to be different laying down

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.600 
was going to be different laying down
like<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.350> ground<00:02:18.560> works<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.950> where<00:02:19.130> skating's

of<00:02:51.770> us<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.070> gave<00:02:52.280> mark<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.670> hard<00:02:52.850> time<00:02:53.090> for<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.540> we

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
of us we gave mark a hard time for it we

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.270 
of us we gave mark a hard time for it we
genuinely<00:02:56.000> thought<00:02:56.570> he<00:02:56.750> was<00:02:56.900> old<00:03:03.250> yeah<00:03:04.250> I

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
genuinely thought he was old yeah I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.880 
genuinely thought he was old yeah I
think<00:03:04.670> he<00:03:04.820> just<00:03:05.030> caught<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:05.480> early<00:03:06.320> enough<00:03:06.620> and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
think he just caught on early enough and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.380 
think he just caught on early enough and
like<00:03:07.430> guy<00:03:08.110> has<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.769> know<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.220> lot<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.820> control

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
like guy has you know a lot of control

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.789 
like guy has you know a lot of control
and<00:03:11.600> very<00:03:12.470> much<00:03:12.799> sort<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.160> his<00:03:13.370> own<00:03:13.519> idea<00:03:14.000> of

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
and very much sort of his own idea of

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.890 
and very much sort of his own idea of
skateboarding<00:03:16.090> he<00:03:17.090> kind<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.600> did<00:03:17.750> his

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
skateboarding he kind of just did his

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.479 
skateboarding he kind of just did his
own<00:03:18.019> thing<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.680> think<00:03:18.739> that's<00:03:19.100> why<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:19.459> all

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
own thing and I think that's why we all

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.370 
own thing and I think that's why we all
admired<00:03:20.000> him<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.239> much<00:03:20.510> aside<00:03:20.870> from<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.200> fact

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
admired him so much aside from the fact

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.020 
admired him so much aside from the fact
that<00:03:21.530> he<00:03:21.680> was<00:03:21.799> doing<00:03:22.100> stuff<00:03:22.310> before<00:03:22.730> anyone

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that he was doing stuff before anyone

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720 
that he was doing stuff before anyone
else<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.660> see<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.950> weird-looking<00:03:24.950> guy<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.400> a

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
else to see a weird-looking guy in a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.009 
else to see a weird-looking guy in a
crooked<00:03:26.180> afro

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
crooked afro

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:35.160 
crooked afro
you<00:03:27.230> know<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.830> was<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.100> most<00:03:28.250> exciting

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.740 

in<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.740> many<00:03:36.800> ways<00:03:37.190> guy<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.910> mark<00:03:38.180> were<00:03:38.390> really

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
in so many ways guy and mark were really

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.440 
in so many ways guy and mark were really
really<00:03:38.930> similar<00:03:39.320> in<00:03:39.710> terms<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.430> I'll<00:03:40.910> just<00:03:41.270> do

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
really similar in terms of I'll just do

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.140 
really similar in terms of I'll just do
it<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.810> see<00:03:41.900> what<00:03:42.140> happens<00:03:42.640> because<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.910> just

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
it and see what happens because it just

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.380 
it and see what happens because it just
seemed<00:03:44.450> like<00:03:44.600> guy<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.710> Mark<00:03:46.130> had<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.940> thing

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
seemed like guy and Mark had that thing

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
seemed like guy and Mark had that thing
that<00:03:48.040> comes<00:03:49.040> from<00:03:50.080> somewhere<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.110> think

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
that comes from somewhere I think

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.490 
that comes from somewhere I think
different<00:03:52.280> than<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:52.700> practice<00:03:53.290> even<00:03:54.290> back

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
different than just practice even back

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.370 
different than just practice even back
then<00:03:54.740> when<00:03:54.920> guy<00:03:55.100> was<00:03:55.340> young<00:03:55.670> he<00:03:56.240> was<00:03:56.420> really

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
then when guy was young he was really

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.070 
then when guy was young he was really
mature<00:03:57.740> for<00:03:57.770> his<00:03:58.160> age<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.460> so<00:03:59.420> much<00:03:59.630> control

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
mature for his age and so much control

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080 
mature for his age and so much control
of<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.740> skateboard<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.490> think<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.790> lot<00:04:01.970> of

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
of the skateboard and I think a lot of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.350 
of the skateboard and I think a lot of
that<00:04:02.210> came<00:04:02.450> from<00:04:02.830> how<00:04:03.830> put<00:04:04.640> together<00:04:04.790> he<00:04:05.210> was

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
that came from how put together he was

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.020 
that came from how put together he was
even<00:04:05.720> at<00:04:05.840> such<00:04:05.990> a<00:04:06.020> young<00:04:06.290> age<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:10.790> his

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
even at such a young age you know his

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.120 
even at such a young age you know his
board<00:04:11.390> was<00:04:11.630> just<00:04:11.840> about<00:04:12.050> half<00:04:12.290> his<00:04:12.500> size<00:04:12.740> I

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
board was just about half his size I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.010 
board was just about half his size I
mean<00:04:13.280> those<00:04:13.460> boards<00:04:13.850> were<00:04:14.000> huge<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.660> he<00:04:14.870> could

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
mean those boards were huge and he could

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.470 
mean those boards were huge and he could
360<00:04:15.620> flip<00:04:15.860> on<00:04:16.070> those<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:16.880> he<00:04:17.150> skated

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
360 flip on those and and he skated

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:27.700 
360 flip on those and and he skated
really<00:04:17.810> fast<00:04:18.140> too<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.270> many<00:04:26.390> ways<00:04:26.710> even

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
really fast too in so many ways even

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.800 
really fast too in so many ways even
though<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.820> six<00:04:29.150> or<00:04:29.270> seven<00:04:29.630> years

though I was you know six or seven years

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.020 
though I was you know six or seven years
older<00:04:30.140> than<00:04:30.260> him<00:04:30.470> he<00:04:30.920> had<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> lot<00:04:31.850> more

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
older than him he had a lot more

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.600 
older than him he had a lot more
confidence<00:04:32.630> than<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.900> did<00:04:33.140> on<00:04:33.170> skateboard
