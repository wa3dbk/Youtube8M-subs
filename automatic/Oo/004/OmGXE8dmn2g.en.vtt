some of these wooden pulleys if you've
seen<00:00:07.649> my<00:00:07.859> other<00:00:07.890> video<00:00:08.309> showing<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> the

seen my other video showing the the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.749 
seen my other video showing the the
wooden<00:00:09.870> pulleys<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.800> know<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.130> can<00:00:11.429> make<00:00:11.550> them

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
wooden pulleys you know I can make them

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.970 
wooden pulleys you know I can make them
with<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.059> floating<00:00:12.509> router<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.080> not

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
with that floating router but not

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
with that floating router but not
everybody<00:00:14.370> has<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> floating<00:00:14.940> router<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.599> what

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
everybody has a floating router so what

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
everybody has a floating router so what
I<00:00:16.410> did<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> come<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> little

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to make out of these little wooden

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.810 
going to make out of these little wooden
pulleys<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.230> I've<00:00:37.530> got<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.280> made<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
pulleys so I've got one here made and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
pulleys so I've got one here made and
the<00:00:39.360> process<00:00:39.780> seems<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> pretty<00:00:40.500> easy<00:00:40.680> it

put a straight cutter in and then just
keep<00:00:55.110> turning<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.620> raising<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> little

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
keep turning it raising the bit a little

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
keep turning it raising the bit a little
bit<00:00:56.670> until<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.149> cuts<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> circle<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:57.960> cutting

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
bit until it cuts the circle but cutting

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.639 
bit until it cuts the circle but cutting
this<00:00:58.829> part<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.750> was<00:01:00.750> always<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> challenge

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
for me but I made a little jig here to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
for me but I made a little jig here to
be<00:01:04.140> able<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.010> worked<00:01:05.309> really

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
fits in there just beautifully so I can

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.679 
fits in there just beautifully so I can
really<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.970> working<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.450> without

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
really see this working so without

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
really see this working so without
talking<00:01:13.020> anymore<00:01:13.229> I'll<00:01:13.530> cut<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> circle<00:01:14.520> oh

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
talking anymore I'll cut this circle oh

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.719 
talking anymore I'll cut this circle oh
and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.150> we'll<00:01:15.390> curve<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.080> nice<00:01:16.350> little

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here and well I'm just going to lower

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990 
here and well I'm just going to lower
this<00:01:42.240> bit<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.659> bit<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.880> up

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.760 

it's<00:04:08.390> probably<00:04:08.750> one<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.050> dirtiest<00:04:09.560> jobs

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
it's probably one of the dirtiest jobs

guess I shouldn't wait it and I'm going
to<00:07:01.740> put<00:07:01.920> these<00:07:02.070> in<00:07:02.280> again<00:07:02.550> I'm<00:07:02.760> going<00:07:02.880> to<00:07:02.970> set

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
to put these in again I'm going to set

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.460 
to put these in again I'm going to set
my<00:07:03.300> depth<00:07:03.540> stop<00:07:03.750> I'm<00:07:03.990> going<00:07:04.110> to<00:07:04.170> put<00:07:04.290> both

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
my depth stop I'm going to put both

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.320 
my depth stop I'm going to put both
pulleys<00:07:04.800> in<00:07:05.010> I<00:07:05.100> need<00:07:05.280> about<00:07:05.670> four<00:07:05.970> of<00:07:06.000> them<00:07:06.210> the

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
pulleys in I need about four of them the

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.840 
pulleys in I need about four of them the
exact<00:07:06.630> same<00:07:06.660> size<00:07:07.110> so<00:07:07.350> I'll<00:07:07.470> put<00:07:07.680> them<00:07:08.370> all<00:07:08.580> in

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
exact same size so I'll put them all in

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.910 
exact same size so I'll put them all in
this<00:07:09.360> jig<00:07:09.630> and<00:07:09.780> I'll<00:07:09.870> set<00:07:10.080> my<00:07:10.230> depth<00:07:10.440> stop<00:07:10.650> and

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
this jig and I'll set my depth stop and

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.710 
this jig and I'll set my depth stop and
I'll<00:07:11.040> redo<00:07:11.610> them<00:07:11.790> all<00:07:11.940> just<00:07:12.180> it'll<00:07:12.420> just<00:07:12.600> take

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
I'll redo them all just it'll just take

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.680 
I'll redo them all just it'll just take
a<00:07:12.780> second<00:07:13.200> this<00:07:13.980> is<00:07:14.130> just<00:07:14.370> to<00:07:14.580> show<00:07:14.940> you<00:07:15.000> how

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
a second this is just to show you how

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.100 
a second this is just to show you how
they<00:07:15.840> turn<00:07:16.020> it<00:07:16.200> so<00:07:17.030> just<00:07:18.030> grab<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.420> belt<00:07:18.600> and

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
they turn it so just grab the belt and

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.310 
they turn it so just grab the belt and
you<00:07:19.440> can<00:07:19.620> see<00:07:20.360> the<00:07:21.360> belt<00:07:21.570> fits<00:07:21.810> in<00:07:21.990> them<00:07:22.140> just

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
you can see the belt fits in them just

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.740 
you can see the belt fits in them just
nice<00:07:23.270> so<00:07:24.270> there<00:07:24.450> we<00:07:24.570> go

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
nice so there we go

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.140 
nice so there we go
so<00:07:25.020> there's<00:07:25.230> a<00:07:25.320> little<00:07:25.620> easier<00:07:25.920> way<00:07:26.100> to<00:07:26.970> make

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
so there's a little easier way to make

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.910 
so there's a little easier way to make
some<00:07:27.360> wooden<00:07:27.510> pulley<00:07:27.810> so<00:07:28.050> now<00:07:28.230> I<00:07:28.260> go<00:07:28.530> to<00:07:28.590> and

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920 
some wooden pulley so now I go to and

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.260 
some wooden pulley so now I go to and
I'm<00:07:29.010> going<00:07:29.190> to<00:07:29.220> gear<00:07:29.430> this<00:07:29.610> up<00:07:29.760> to<00:07:29.940> to<00:07:30.120> make

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
I'm going to gear this up to to make

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.940 
I'm going to gear this up to to make
some<00:07:30.450> smaller<00:07:30.750> ones<00:07:31.020> so<00:07:31.080> it<00:07:31.260> because<00:07:31.620> I<00:07:31.650> want

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
some smaller ones so it because I want

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.240 
some smaller ones so it because I want
some<00:07:32.130> big<00:07:32.310> ones<00:07:32.430> and<00:07:32.700> I<00:07:32.850> want<00:07:33.030> some<00:07:33.180> small<00:07:33.480> ones

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250 
some big ones and I want some small ones

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.560 
some big ones and I want some small ones
so<00:07:35.250> keep<00:07:35.430> tuning<00:07:35.730> in<00:07:35.850> hopefully<00:07:36.300> you've
