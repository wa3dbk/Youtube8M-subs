00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.100
 the chicken look here we have the breast of 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.210
 chicken in strips we're going to put it in a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.159
 dish and we will milk milk 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.770
 to you remember when we talk about 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.289
 breaded that is good number one for 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.350
 that meat number two be softened for 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.320
 that can absorb all the breaded 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.049
 what are we going to do is breaded is going to 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.540
 serve you I think a lot is fine 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.510
 if you can not find it, do not worry 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.340
 use only ground bread we're going to 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.430
 put delicious parmesan cheese they do not know 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.950
 how rich is that we are going to mix it and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 let's put some seasoning 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.660
 chicken soup and to make it good 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.780
 Italian we're going to put oregano that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
 with your hands you will relive 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.130
 remember that it is an herb that is dry 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.770
 and if we pulverize it, it revives all the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.540
 aromas and flavors do not know how rich 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.180
 it smells in fact you can do more 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 amount of this breaded and save it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.220
 in a jar like that when you have a little 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.870
 in a hurry in the kitchen is already 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.890
 waiting for it exactly country ready 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.709
 then let's spend our band-aids 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.989
 of chicken that can be anywhere 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.540
 of chicken today we choose the breast because 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.730
 is very tender is lean then we are going to 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.360
 cover it perfectly when you 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.190
 cover any piece make sure it is 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.010
 very dry and with his hands he manages to penetrate 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.180
 all the breaded like this is going to be a 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.120
 perfectly breaded and crisp 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.459
 there we are going to withdraw the excess and 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.769
 I have the hot oil like that 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.470
 hot but not too hot 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.140
 it has to be high medium temperature 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.230
 because if not the parmesan burns is 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.080
 very delicate the straw and does not know how rich 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.110
 that smells kids will love 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.959
 You will see how they are done, they will remember 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.690
 from me because they're going to fascinate you can 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.090
 serve with a little bit of pasta with a 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.840
 little bit of potato salad too 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.420
 it would be very very rich then look 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.000
 how fast it gets golden and how it is super 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.680
 delgadito the chicken then then it 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.540
 kitchen super soon there is 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.060
 delicious or the rich truth is that the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.800
 parmesan cheese the truth that gives you very 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.870
 very good taste then 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.260
 you have to be very aware that you do not know 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.750
 pass us from gold 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.239
 and in fact when we are in this 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.150
 occasion as with seven so hot 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.010
 we are in the kitchen worshiping is very 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.560
 important that is pending so that 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.690
 it will not go to color because 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.789
 Believe me, what turns around is 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.100
 burn then we better be 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.680
 earrings of him 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.280
 and it smells delicious indeed as I say 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.030
 I'm going to serve and nothing more, and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.060
 I'm going to make the breast juicy 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.670
 taste really good with the consommé 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.850
 oregano and Parmesan very well we have 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.860
 the strips we will remove from the fire the 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.320
 oil to stop burning 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.530
 then we are going to do our 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.200
 Wonderful and very simple dressing this 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.620
 right once or Caesar actually takes 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.170
 Anchovies and raw egg but good 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.750
 for our hurry you know that in the 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.240
 kitchen we do not have much time we have 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.410

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.500
 little garlic the garlic is fine and the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.150
 Molinito well chopped a little juice 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.350

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.900
 you neither the anchovy nor the raw egg 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.620
 mayonnaise already has egg in fact says 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 that I knew the grandson who created the 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.340
 Caesar salad that is from low tijuana 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.840
 california that the truth the story 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.610
 is very curious yesterday in tijuana was born 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.180
 this salad became famous 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.150
 worldwide to our plate and we're going 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.810
 to put the lettuces a little bit of 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:14.440
 this dressing the dressing or the vinaigrette 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.780
 he gets a few seconds before he can 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.009
 serve the table because if not 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.349
 lettuces are going to soften too 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.439
 and do not put too much dressing is also 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.259
 important to put it right nothing more to 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.139
 Let the lettuce be covered 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.930

 can eat up to two dishes of lettuce 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:43.229
 and nothing happens to him then 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:46.159
 let's put here the chick that does not 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:50.309
