to<00:01:36.509> build<00:01:36.750> I've<00:01:37.320> already<00:01:37.619> said<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to build I've already said you have to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
to build I've already said you have to
make<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.729> spectacular<00:01:39.390> builds<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> plot

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
make some spectacular builds on the plot

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
make some spectacular builds on the plot
server<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> don't

server but the way to do that is don't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
server but the way to do that is don't
ask<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.799> check<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.189> build

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
ask me to like go check out your build

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
ask me to like go check out your build
because<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.149> typically<00:01:45.450> busy<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.200> on
