00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.249

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.249
 from beginning to end 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 we map the files 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.000
 here is our doing it 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.740
 we repeat I want to say that doing root is practically a price file 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.380
 here no work of any kind is applied 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.710
 type of change 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.740
 eve 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.010
 we should do the following on the computer 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.200
 so there is no intervention by the camera procession 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.930
 so let's start setting up our common camera if you weren't muscat 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.070
 and this moment this photo 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.970
 we are going to present the color profile of the camera at the time of shooting 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.170
 I would rather redeem 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.250
 in the room - too much portraits 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 are profiles downloaded from the web and from the street to the friend's site 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 applied profile 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 and let's make the first changes already 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 here we already have peaks to get out of which calais gods 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.050
 castellucci region burned 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.460
 and let's see how it is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.650
 touch up this shot better 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.530
 I'm going to set white balance mailto instead of one I always make gods 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.990
 attempts 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.120
 and then more or less you can more or take it 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 dropper I like to put in white 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.359
 and it makes us of the various nest to raise the prometheus various points 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.790
 as you can see the histogram is a correctly exposed photograph 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.759
 to which we burned reality and light in the shadows 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.249
 so it's a picture that you can work just know 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.639
 when it can recover with parameters 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.279

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.519
 as you can see 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.760
 this change is always good to do it 100% 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.369
 we break 100% so you can see noise level 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 100% 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.009

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.159
 once these parameters have been set 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.559
