 typical almost 900 dollars let's 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.430
 see if such a computer can 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.470
 to cope with tasks for which it is accepted

 before active operation 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.309
 need only install the package 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.730
 required programs 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 everything 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 thanks go to limbs 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 arrive and 1201pn step up quite step 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.350
 can act as a fashion 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.130

 one of 46 kilograms and its thickness 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 based on twenty seven three

 glossy it gives a design 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 expressive devices but 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.050
 while the white elephant 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.720
 received 1201n equipped

 widescreen display with a diagonal 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.090
 12 inch picture resolution is

 1366x768 pixels glossy display 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 noticeably glare and solve this problem 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.790
 helps LED 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.460
 backlit a small margin of brightness in

 0 3 megapixel realized 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 camera and microphone to ensure

 keyboard is located at the top 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.470
 parts of the working panel because of this dynamic in 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.860
 build on the front edge of the hull 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.050
 enroll and 1201 channel is equipped with a convenient pe 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.720
 became a support 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 the main feature of which is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.450
 significant gap between 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.290
 keys 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.720
 glossy touchpad practically 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.020
 merge with the mining panayotov 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.930
 control keys and objective or 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.120
 informed coverage 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.470
 additionally provided 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.150
 touchpad connection like most 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 laptops this one works very quietly and 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.380
 practically not called 20 years 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.720
 being in operation were enemies in general 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.070
 using 3000 1201pn seemed to us very 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.010
 convenient and comfortable large display 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.420
 and rox multimedia platform 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.430
 slightly reduced the standard 10 inch 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.090
 battery life models from 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 standard battery 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.129
 capacity of 4400 milliampere hours and with 50 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.640
 1201n worked a little more 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.529
 four o'clock 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.889
 everything 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.699
 the main advantage of this 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:32.769
 fact is high speed 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.869
 multimedia applications with 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.809
 that it is equipped with amd atom processor n270 with 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.199
 frequency of 1 6 gigahertz it is used 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.310
 nvidia ion graphic system 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.950
 allowing not only to watch the video 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.580
 high definition we have to play 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.980
 some computer games 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.500
 standard RAM 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.269
 is 1 gigabyte 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.199
 but if necessary, this parameter can be 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.749
 double the capacity of the hard drive 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.169
 is 160 gigabytes in total 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.749
 satisfied with the speed 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.650
 systems, that is, letters, but only those 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.199
 gained 1910 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.049
 what is impressive 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.049
 results of data 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.579
 test 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.739
 at the embassy letters 1201 final has some 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.180
 national respond versus 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.069
 with more affordable models you can 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.879
 connect both the monitor to the position 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.450
 and TV with support got 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.669
 permission using the interface of this topic 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.230
 so he may well 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.959
 used as 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.919
 video player these connectors 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.760
 mounted on the left side next to them 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.510
 the user will see the interface if 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.730
 let the charger socket 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.169
 on the right side of the body are located 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.379
 two more interfaces lawyer and youth 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.430
 bottom of the network adapter hole 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.299
 Penza castle and card reader 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.790
 support only two formats 5 10 m with 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.620
 the only significant gap and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.230
 device functionality can 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.609
 count only empty brains 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.409
 tusk for wireless connection here 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.639
 uses its own interface 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.559
 orders 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.319
 in all 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 Summing up we can say that Muscovites 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.309
 1201 finance us this is indirect 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.789
 which answer more accessible 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:59.929
 models because it is active 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.629
 used for multimedia purposes 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 characters 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.819
 everything
