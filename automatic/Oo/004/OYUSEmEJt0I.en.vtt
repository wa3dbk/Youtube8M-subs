00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.110
 then I believe that in this situation there is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.600
 are two considerations to make 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.010
 the first is about the wrong attitude 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 of mario balotelli towards the referees 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.320
 because in the last meeting with 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.509
 in the meeting between referees and coaches 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.919
 captains was asked and rightly 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.890
 an attitude of courses towards the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.430
 referees and this all players for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.949
 at least those of the Milan must have it 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.980
 mario balotelli was wrong because he has 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.609
 penalized after a good game that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 the company had made the team e 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.710
 fans now for three days 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 this proves the fact is confirmation 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 that the company hasn't even done 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.710
 race then on this attitude 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 We must change 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.270
 then another consideration must be made which 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
 on this what mario balotelli must 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 change and improve and help the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.860
 referees to protect it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.299
 because mario balotelli what he has 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 just last Sunday at mario balotelli 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.680
 as you surely do to another 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 player were whistled all or 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 decisions were made completely 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
 different I believe the company has given 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.619
 the strong signal because why the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 society much compared to the class 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 arbitration and making the appeal 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 proved this wrong point 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.860
 stop 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.549
 he got it wrong and that's all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 and sea must grow because it is 23 years old 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.000
 a world-class player 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.630
 represents the Italian national team and must 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.509
 to grow up 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 just ended up wrong and at a time 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.090
 then hopefully you won't be wrong anymore
