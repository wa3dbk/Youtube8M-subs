comes to about it's right here so it's a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.650 
comes to about it's right here so it's a
pretty<00:05:17.600> much<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:18.020> 1.5<00:05:18.919> x<00:05:19.460> or<00:05:19.760> almost<00:05:20.090> 2<00:05:20.390> times

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
pretty much like 1.5 x or almost 2 times

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.150 
pretty much like 1.5 x or almost 2 times
the<00:05:21.500> size<00:05:22.040> of<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.310> typical<00:05:22.630> lvx<00:05:23.630> kit<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.950> that's

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
the size of a typical lvx kit so that's

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.640 
the size of a typical lvx kit so that's
there<00:05:25.820> so

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
there so

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.760 
there so
I<00:05:27.880> mean<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.210> price<00:05:29.450> is<00:05:29.720> twice<00:05:30.290> as<00:05:30.320> much

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
I mean the price is twice as much

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.790 
I mean the price is twice as much
because<00:05:31.430> it's<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:32.600> huge<00:05:33.140> in<00:05:33.470> terms<00:05:33.650> of

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
because it's it's it's huge in terms of

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.070 
because it's it's it's huge in terms of
height<00:05:34.010> but<00:05:34.850> also<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:35.450> know<00:05:35.540> in<00:05:35.660> terms<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
height but also you know in terms of

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.500 
height but also you know in terms of
actual<00:05:37.070> volume<00:05:37.640> you<00:05:37.820> get<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.000> lot<00:05:38.210> on<00:05:38.240> the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
actual volume you get a lot on the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.570 
actual volume you get a lot on the
backpack<00:05:40.300> yeah<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.930> know<00:05:42.050> not<00:05:42.740> that<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:43.160> idea

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
backpack yeah you know not that the idea

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.520 
backpack yeah you know not that the idea

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
for bad guy to reuse some of the old

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.060 
for bad guy to reuse some of the old
mold<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.060> all<00:05:47.060> idea<00:05:47.450> but<00:05:47.840> yet<00:05:48.080> come<00:05:48.440> up<00:05:48.560> come

mold and all idea but yet come up come
up<00:05:49.130> with<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.550> new<00:05:49.730> LBX<00:05:50.570> kit<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:52.220> think<00:05:52.910> it's

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
up with the new LBX kit I think it's

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.680 
up with the new LBX kit I think it's
pretty<00:05:53.150> good

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
pretty good

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.410 
pretty good

bulky<00:05:56.420> and<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:58.340> joint<00:05:58.610> is<00:05:58.760> gonna<00:05:58.970> be<00:05:59.150> really

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
bulky and the joint is gonna be really

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.090

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.430 
you know not gonna be good
that<00:06:01.640> was<00:06:01.760> my<00:06:01.910> prediction<00:06:02.420> but<00:06:03.170> after

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
that was my prediction but after

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.080 
that was my prediction but after
building<00:06:03.620> it<00:06:03.920> I<00:06:04.100> think<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.520> guy<00:06:04.730> has<00:06:04.910> the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
building it I think this guy has the

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.390 
building it I think this guy has the
most<00:06:05.330> solid<00:06:06.610> joint<00:06:07.690> system<00:06:08.690> in<00:06:09.350> in<00:06:09.830> lvx

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
most solid joint system in in lvx

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.390 
most solid joint system in in lvx
universe<00:06:11.170> from<00:06:12.170> all<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.590> kid<00:06:12.800> that<00:06:13.010> I<00:06:13.070> built

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400
