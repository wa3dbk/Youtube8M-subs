the point in the season where your

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.170 
the point in the season where your

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
were really up for it well I think it

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.009 
were really up for it well I think it
was<00:03:49.989> naturally<00:03:50.769> was<00:03:50.920> far<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.639> would<00:03:51.790> say<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.600> mean

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
was naturally was far I would say I mean

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.229 
was naturally was far I would say I mean
the<00:03:53.109> first<00:03:53.290> race<00:03:53.500> or<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.670> all<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.000> winter

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the first race or the all the winter

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.220 
the first race or the all the winter
training<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.690> then<00:03:55.780> when<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:55.930> get<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.139> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
training and then when you get to the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.930 
training and then when you get to the
first<00:03:56.410> race<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.829> then<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.579> find<00:03:57.790> that

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
first race and then you find that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.920 
first race and then you find that
obviously<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.269> don't<00:03:58.389> get<00:03:58.480> even<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.780> see

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
through to the finish line was tough and

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.830
