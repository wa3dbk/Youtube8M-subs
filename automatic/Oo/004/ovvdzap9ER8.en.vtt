00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.180
 who will win this wooden microphone the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.039
 post you have probably read it if not 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 you did it went on beppegrillo.it 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.529
 and you see it now that you put it all 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.289
 screen 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.230
 this is today's post poll 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.519
 Italy is in 69th place in the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.609
 ranking of freedom of information 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.169
 according to the 2013 freedom report 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.160
 house so we lost a lot of 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.230
 places because we were at 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.480
 57th last year one 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.629
 country therefore judged semi-free 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.670
 think if this board is possible 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.960
 so of analysis I respect freedom 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.299
 information from Western countries 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.920
 may consider Italy that in short 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.720
 is bea of ​​being among the countries 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.750
 more industrialized and civilized than the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.570
 world of being in one in the rankings 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.939
 of et behind in ghana papua new guinea 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.559
 solomon islands of Samoa and Tonga bible 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.470
 guyana with all respect for these 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.850
 countries televisions affect the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.340
 judgment of the Italians more than any 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.229
 other media, in fact, the newspapers are little 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.790
 disseminated by us both as an absolute number 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.370
 both in relation to other nations 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.200
 Europeans for an obvious syllogism then 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.330
 if the information is handled in Italy 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 filtered array adulterated the maximum 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.720
 responsibility is of televisions and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.180
 who is part of it 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.000
 I know it's the discovery of hot water 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 as beppe says if three national channels 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 are owned by Berlusconi in 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.220
 obvious conflict of interest as 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.600
 dealer and the other three gods 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.650
 parties that use them for their own 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.659
 propaganda 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.750
 citizens can not decide without 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.100
 know or judge the choices of the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.729
 politics because this is what it is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.400
 It happens 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.770
 today's survey is not free 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.570
 wants to assign the wooden microphone 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
 to the most partisan network to the director of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.380
 network more deployed to the talk host 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.380
 show more in bad faith to you the judgment 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.930
 the survey will close tomorrow at hours 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.340
 14 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.799
 let's go and see, however, the i 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.159
 partial results those that in this 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.459
 moment they see at least are three notes 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.260
 the sections we said what is the network 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.560
 Most biased television we see static 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.810
 their trouble a little bit started me 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.580
 draw immediately to see network 4 I do not know 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.959
 if you agree or not but in short 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.550
 there will probably be among you 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.410
 people who also voted this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.430
 survey so maybe you will be 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.989
 agree then I have to see network4 with 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.350
 37 63 percent 8.400 36 votes as 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.540
 more biased followed by raitre with 18 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.260
 per cent from channel 5 with 17 then 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.170
 raiuno italy 1 la7 and rai 2 and sky tg24 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.030
 lastly, that of sky tg24 remains 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280
 let's say last place then the first 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.099
 place for freedom we can say so 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.470
 what the director is instead 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.730
 of tg more biased 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.680
 tg4 always ranks first 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.980
 therefore rete4 but in this case is the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.430
 director giovanni toti with advance 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.470
 study opened 38.71 percent then white 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.340
 berlinguer in second place of tg3 with 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.489
 on 21 and 75 then to the TG5 guided by the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.440
 Clemente New Moon is 20.03 percent 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.140
 and then to follow mario orfeo marcello 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.709
 tg2 farms to re- comment on the 7 is always 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.290
 sky tg24 as last with sarah varetto 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.569
 let's finish what the talk presenter is 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.980
 show more biased and there are some here 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.470
 beautiful 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.650
 how strange brown wasp came out to 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.769
 brings 26.46 percent with 5,900 votes 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.329
 almost 6,000 in second place 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.030
 afternoon barbarous five with 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.040
 22.36 percent then in third place 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.480
 paolo del debbio fifth column second 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 me if he would have played it quietly 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.430
 with brown wasp maybe brown wasp is a 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.560
 so more famous so for this reason it is 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.420
 at the top of the leaderboard you can 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.359
 to follow in fourth place giovanni floris 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.880

 our survey on the wooden microphone 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.389
