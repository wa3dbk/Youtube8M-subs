I<00:00:03.240> play<00:00:03.600> intramural<00:00:04.140> soccer<00:00:06.529> play<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
I play intramural soccer play on the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.660 
I play intramural soccer play on the
valley<00:00:07.980> filled<00:00:09.170> our<00:00:10.170> student<00:00:10.769> body<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.190> really

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
valley filled our student body is really

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.419 
valley filled our student body is really
involved<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.509> intramural<00:00:12.900> sports<00:00:13.429> so

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
involved in the intramural sports so

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.630 
involved in the intramural sports so
everyone<00:00:14.910> has<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> lot<00:00:15.389> of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.519 

we<00:00:22.029> have<00:00:22.240> zero<00:00:22.750> current<00:00:22.990> going<00:00:23.230> through<00:00:23.349> the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
we have zero current going through the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.859 
we have zero current going through the
resistor<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.009> we<00:00:24.279> have<00:00:24.430> eps<00:00:24.880> my<00:00:25.449> major<00:00:25.689> is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
resistor and we have eps my major is

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.570 
resistor and we have eps my major is
electrical<00:00:26.470> engineering<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.039> a<00:00:27.160> minor<00:00:27.490> in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
electrical engineering and a minor in

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.729 
electrical engineering and a minor in
mathematics<00:00:28.000> can<00:00:28.840> explain<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.410> difference

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
mathematics can explain the difference

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.890 
mathematics can explain the difference
between<00:00:29.919> a<00:00:30.130> Jaffa<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.759> a<00:00:30.880> MOSFET<00:00:31.329> transistor

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
between a Jaffa and a MOSFET transistor

between a Jaffa and a MOSFET transistor
again<00:00:32.110> my<00:00:32.230> professors<00:00:32.680> are<00:00:32.829> great<00:00:32.860> they're

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
again my professors are great they're

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.189 
again my professors are great they're
really<00:00:34.059> concerned<00:00:34.420> about<00:00:34.570> how<00:00:34.899> we<00:00:34.960> do

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
really concerned about how we do

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.420 
really concerned about how we do
academically<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:35.920> they<00:00:36.010> want<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.250> make<00:00:36.399> sure

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
academically and they want to make sure

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.070 
academically and they want to make sure
that<00:00:36.760> we<00:00:36.879> learn<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.180> material<00:00:37.300> you're<00:00:37.960> gonna

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
that we learn the material you're gonna

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.320 
that we learn the material you're gonna
get<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.350> high<00:00:38.559> voltage<00:00:38.769> or<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.190> low<00:00:39.339> voltage<00:00:39.580> dr.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
get a high voltage or a low voltage dr.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.060 
get a high voltage or a low voltage dr.

how<00:00:44.559> would<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.010> initialize<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.879> sea<00:00:46.300> program

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
how would you initialize a sea program

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.200 
how would you initialize a sea program
for<00:00:47.140> this<00:00:47.379> specific<00:00:47.920> Albert<00:00:48.579> that's

particular to your microprocessor you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.439 
particular to your microprocessor you
can<00:00:51.430> definitely<00:00:51.579> tell<00:00:51.820> she's<00:00:52.180> very<00:00:52.329> excited

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
can definitely tell she's very excited

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.170 
can definitely tell she's very excited
about<00:00:52.989> what<00:00:53.260> she<00:00:53.379> teaches

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
about what she teaches

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.390 
about what she teaches
I<00:00:57.960> live<00:00:58.960> in<00:00:58.990> what's<00:00:59.440> called<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.710> university

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
I live in what's called the university

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.180 
I live in what's called the university
terrace<00:01:00.700> apartments<00:01:04.770> they're<00:01:05.770> right<00:01:06.040> across

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
terrace apartments they're right across

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.950 
terrace apartments they're right across
the<00:01:06.460> street<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.820> linda<00:01:07.060> vista<00:01:07.180> but<00:01:07.600> are<00:01:07.720> still

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the street and linda vista but are still

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.680 
the street and linda vista but are still
considered<00:01:08.380> on-campus<00:01:08.920> housing<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.610> i<00:01:10.390> think

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
considered on-campus housing and i think

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.420 
considered on-campus housing and i think
it's<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.900> best<00:01:11.080> one<00:01:11.380> because<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:12.070> walk<00:01:12.250> to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
it's the best one because the walk to

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.180 
it's the best one because the walk to
class<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.910> approximately<00:01:13.870> five<00:01:14.410> minutes<00:01:14.800> it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
class is approximately five minutes it

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.040 
class is approximately five minutes it
is<00:01:15.310> not<00:01:15.550> too<00:01:15.880> long<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.240> all<00:01:16.330> i<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:19.270> lunch<00:01:19.540> at<00:01:19.990> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
there's a lot more places to eat them

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.529 
there's a lot more places to eat them
people<00:01:31.140> realize<00:01:31.850> we're<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.060> lucky<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> have

that right I currently work at the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
that right I currently work at the
Career<00:01:42.000> Services<00:01:42.509> Department<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.709> I<00:01:43.740> helped

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
Career Services Department so I helped

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
Career Services Department so I helped
put<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.429> the<00:01:44.579> engineering<00:01:44.969> career<00:01:45.479> fair<00:01:45.539> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
put on the engineering career fair and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
put on the engineering career fair and
we<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:46.350> 10<00:01:46.770> different<00:01:47.069> companies<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.119> came

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
we had 10 different companies that came

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
we had 10 different companies that came
they<00:01:49.349> love<00:01:49.560> coming<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.039> USD<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.849> our

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
they love coming here to USD because our

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.459 
they love coming here to USD because our
alumni<00:01:51.719> are<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.289> representatives

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
alumni are some of the representatives

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.929 
alumni are some of the representatives
so<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> special<00:01:53.819> connection

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so they have a special connection

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.709 
so they have a special connection
already<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.810> students<00:01:57.829> I<00:02:02.390> belonged<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> beta
