00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and really not bad for $49 the only

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.650 
and really not bad for $49 the only
major<00:00:36.270> issue<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> helmet<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.660> fact

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
major issue with the helmet is the fact

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
major issue with the helmet is the fact
that<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> ball<00:00:40.020> goes<00:00:40.200> those<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.190> through

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that the ball goes those does go through

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
that the ball goes those does go through
the<00:00:41.489> grill<00:00:41.700> relatively<00:00:42.600> easy<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the grill relatively easy I do have it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
the grill relatively easy I do have it
set<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.100> its<00:00:44.370> smaller<00:00:44.940> setting<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
set on its smaller setting I'm so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
set on its smaller setting I'm so
essentially<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.739> its<00:00:46.890> safest<00:00:47.280> setting<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
essentially on its safest setting if you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.529 
essentially on its safest setting if you
watch<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> video<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.000> GM<00:00:51.000> helmet

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
watch the video I did of the GM helmet

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.950 
watch the video I did of the GM helmet
the<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.780> day<00:00:51.960> where<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> ball<00:00:53.480> were<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> was

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the other day where the ball were it was

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
the other day where the ball were it was
almost<00:00:55.170> impossible<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.890> penetrate<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> grill

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
almost impossible to penetrate the grill

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
almost impossible to penetrate the grill
but<00:00:57.510> you'll<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.899> where<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.410> slightly

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but you'll see where this it is slightly

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
but you'll see where this it is slightly
different<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.850> regular<00:01:00.719> regulation

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
different so just regular regulation

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.009 
different so just regular regulation
ball<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> puffs<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> goes<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.940> through<00:01:03.019> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
ball and puffs it goes right through so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.649 
ball and puffs it goes right through so
it's<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.710> simple<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it's really as simple as that so that is

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's really as simple as that so that is
definitely<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.020> design<00:01:07.170> flaw<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
definitely a design flaw and and and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
definitely a design flaw and and and
this<00:01:08.460> remember<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> an<00:01:09.119> older<00:01:09.390> helmet

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this remember this is an older helmet

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.060 
this remember this is an older helmet
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> Albion<00:01:10.650> has<00:01:10.799> worked

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this is something that Albion has worked

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.960 
this is something that Albion has worked
on<00:01:11.960> will<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.229> checking<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> titanium

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
