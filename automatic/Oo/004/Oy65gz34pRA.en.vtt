 is rotten and commenting on another gameplay 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 more than crops that do not get surprised because 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.210
 it is what you are used to see 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.880
 now you are getting used to these coming 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 days and I will talk to you about a topic 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.299
 important that is normally interested 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.529
 each one of you all who are 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.029
 in this video surely some 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 even that not only in my videos that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.090
 you would be brown pigs to do 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.100
 that surely in this video because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 maybe you're interested in playing with me, and it's 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.430
 because every day I receive many requests 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 of friendship in the account of jolie 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 to play with me then good as 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 now on playstation network have 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
 got it if I'm not wrong I'm at 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 91% sure of having read it and that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 I think it 's true since the apl comes and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
 4 soon you know that the invite of friends 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.200
 in playstation 3 it's good in the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.629
 playstation network of the proposal 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 work precision is that of 100 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.250
 friends, if I'm not wrong, they 'll do 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 increased that number to two thousand friends by 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.460
 side if I'm not wrong I think we can 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 have two thousand friends added in total 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 now on every door to playstation 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.989
 network then many of you do not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.250
 you know that I have for example good 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 good good the filthy pig here 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.920
 to talk a little about the implication 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
 many of you do not know that I 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 Well I have another account other than by 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.699
 ironic in my normal account I have a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 account that is called hobbit drift 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.899
 the description will have exactly as 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.770
 the description is described exactly 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.539
 so do not ask why because 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.799
 Is the description worth 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.450
 I have another account that good the name 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.820
 comes a little about what I like to be 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.280
 of the years why I have hobbit a little 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.319
 bullshit the truth but I'm cool and another 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.970
 sad because good I do like three or 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.219
 four years I got hooked on youtube to see 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.350
 videos of a sniper clan that 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.659
 they are called the drift is from rf in 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 capital letters and then as he was very fan then 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 I made an account and as a purpose 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.250
 it was just playing with the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.689
 sniper but since I started with 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.860
 this youtube because it has saved me as 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.229
 secondary account to play with the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.119
 subscribers and really never neither 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.590
 I got to use it as much as I 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.909
 I would have liked it because he was always 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.679
 read addy ximo always always always 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.239
 so everything you have in mind 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.099
 I'm sorry if he does not play much with you 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.750
 it conjugates enough games also you 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.420
 you share in modern warfare youtube 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.640
 3 and those things and the black or 2 some 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 also then now I'm going to put a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.369
 little more serious with that issue of playing with 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.989
 you with subscribers since 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.670
 lately I have many requests for 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.130
 friendship many new people entering the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.149
 channel and some apart from charming less 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.369
 for you stay too 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.129
 will like the truth play with me 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.390
 to heat then the thing is that 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.450
 Anyone who sends me the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.590
 request if it is true that there are 2000 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.269
 gaps to add friends as I'm going 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 to add everyone or whatever it is all 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.200
 so do not hesitate at any time in 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 send a request and if you want to have 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.610
 more friends that you want to say that I 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.290
 know and such then you have to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.360
 subscribe to the channel and add me as 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.799
 friends and with that already in any 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.180
 when I play, connect to that 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.680
 count a good one here running with the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.500
 man is like a crazy asshole 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.090
 but if you want to add me you already know 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.209
 hobbit ' low bar you have it in the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.709
 description if you are not sure and I 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.030
 I think it says basically about when 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.069
 play with the connectors as in the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.599
 multiplayer matches is 6 against 6 and no 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.940
 there are nine against nine because I think that 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.599
 we will make private parties up to 18 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.129
 people 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.720
 we can play infected we can play 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.310
 butt we can play any mode of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.500
 fun game not also a way to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.359
 hunted game of these new ones also 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.129
 entertaining and fun because that's how 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.170
 it will give time to all games and although 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.459
 well I have a lot of people added me 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.129
 I do not think there's always going to be 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.599
 world is going to be connected then already 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.389
 You know how to add me and when I invite you 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.280
 well play and with me and that's it and I think 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.730
 that everything is that more or less said about 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.050
 of 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.340
 If you want to play with me, no, and I think 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.110
 that surely many of you 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.310
 you have so send me the requests 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.709
 to the hobbit bar low tris and not to 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.909
 polidori I repeat to the young girl by iron 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.190
 and why by mistake and it is more personal 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.140
 more you love me for real friends that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.870
 I have to know the real life well and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.280
 all those things and young people more for the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.349
 people that youtube voters 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
 etcetera keep remembering to add me there 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.799
 by and anyone who kills me for 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.319
 iron and I do not read it much case to say 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.640
 nothing so good I hope this idea 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.720
 the squares look good so be able 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.760
 play with all of you from time to time 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.409
 when and the example of a new departure 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.750
 that magician 19 casualties in dying 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.860
 19 17 I'm wrong and I'm playing perelmÃ¡n 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.829
 since it was one of the first games 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.239
 I just saw a cow running or I 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.650
 it seemed to me I think I've seen something 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.540
 running in front of me that I do not know what 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.980
 was I swear I do not think I do not think it's 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.510
 a cow or maybe yes but nothing that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.510
 right now I should not be flipping 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.410
 bullshit remember your I like 150 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.269
 but a pass for this gameplay and 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.769
 this is a parity what by teams of 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.180
 which I started from my first 10 of 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.980
 game and we ended up killing this pig 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.630
 a single total subscribe I've done it already 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.630
 and then goodbye
