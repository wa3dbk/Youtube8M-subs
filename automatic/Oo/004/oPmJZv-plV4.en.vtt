step about this big
I<00:05:12.389> can<00:05:12.840> only<00:05:13.020> progress<00:05:13.590> about<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:14.159> rate<00:05:14.490> I'm

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
I can only progress about this rate I'm

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.999 
I can only progress about this rate I'm
still<00:05:15.419> doing<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.840> same<00:05:16.080> slow<00:05:16.470> slow<00:05:16.740> quick

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009
