00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 trees and there are no deadly bombs like you are used to from 10 ti though 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.079
 that will come back later 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.849
 these are bombs that contain items that are automatic 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.180
 get to the ground like this 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.650
 I'm going to show you all this is the normal 10 ti formula you need 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.240
 and I have done a few examples of pia making good 10 timo but 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.430
 every market, of course, knows that 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 that means they prix what they fall and here what falls flowers 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250
 and i get you so different types 10 10 after each has the different color 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.319
 it very different and if there is already a look at Christmas then we also see 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:39.289
 nicely not the turn wormer colors port white smoke 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.049
 2 but also narrower or just flowers with such 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.019
 and is of course becoming a cleaner word 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.579
 and these have known that we are going to demonstrate just go and leave something 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.039
 see 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.940
 the nice thing is he has added the city last and and the viewer is there for it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 border and durk if we have that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 I am going to be able to use a lead to make a fire at once reflex to 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
 show along on that is you think how exactly does it work 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 but is it just a woman bomb you more 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.450
 of course they put a tower to the west next to or over the gong 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.469
 redstone 10 how you want 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.280
 at least that the teams that goes off 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 and then the magic goes 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.789
 with it all has flowers and they are now just everywhere 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.310
 instead of stopping something breaks 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.060
 is now replacing dietz 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 why is the sun going? 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.230
 that work look forward to this knowledge with all different things doing it 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.960
 actually speaks for itself 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.840
 and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.689
 what I like what I like we think the reed team it is of course super handy it 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.979
 is very annoying to put all trees where you want and because on 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:48.850
 this way 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.939
 you just have serbian everywhere sure that a tree is going to grow 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 that is actually a bit of the idea and of course also on different one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.980
 strong point is that is also nice but funny 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.540
 it does actually make you chroma key with normal setting i have different 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.390
 settings back so it sounds a bit too p but it is one 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.099
 funny one 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.120
 capone function 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.440
 he can also show you how to make a farm very quickly 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.179
 and that is just turn to place 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.199
 then we go against the dull oléron 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:19.719
 and that is 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.289
 Sunday also takes the ride in the cooling water because that's how you get it 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.610
 of course a farm and that water goes to the rider 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.930
 9 packages is going to fill that say and now we have the pit stop anyway 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.920
 what had played with a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.379
 with bankruptcy 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.060
 Then you don't have to do that with a hotel 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.800
 he did not run everything that is a shame it is not immediately very large 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.009
 surfaces says local and the cubes so that is one 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.469
 bit of a shame but it does help it does with and if we then have the habit 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.099
 throw peeters over it and thereby train along swimming 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.600
 if you have knowledge we cannot be sure 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.160
 and we get to stop on the ek and then 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.590
 port food also left epo tetanus on it and then goes on of course 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.259
 just good of course 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.739
 I personally think that this work is not entirely true, because it is 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.170
 the year you get port peeters anyway I have now two have been picked up once 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.530
 is yes you have ecosys is not necessarily on one 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 Farmland It's just a funny funny feature like a couple 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.439
 trees grow church is aj old that goes well that it does 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.549
 and and that they thought they would be funny or the Finnish, I think so too 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.120
 patrick the great 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.849
 a major disadvantage of this 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.069
 there is and then going to be I am now going to put in a demo file 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.959
 and there we go 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 this is still per match 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.200
 4 that is a disadvantage 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.640
 that record for shortly after it was a decade if you want too fast 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.010
 delft ex quickly wants to have full and you get there by the mésche you can 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.640
 dying because that is 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.200
 incidentally, I think a very funny meal is definitely worth it 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.239
 worth to show the pvv 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.579
 how exactly he worked and what that looks like and I can imagine myself there 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.819
 be in the description there is just one and linkedin that make is that 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.629
 very very young even could set foot May 9 is very bad and very bad 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:24.599
 young jogi and the heavy bacon parties say that things like this are already possible 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.159
 to make 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.450
 I think it's laughter 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.530
 and I thought it was worth it to show you guys, blue-footed 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.370
 see where it already seems and you want more designs for me leave uncertain 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.160
 know everts behind with those already more than we want more 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.120
 then I'm going to try and experience the different things 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.520
 new moth know the sweat 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.639
 guys i talk to you and thanks for watching
