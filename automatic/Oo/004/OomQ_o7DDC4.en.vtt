00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.800 

in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> compare<00:00:03.360> some

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
in this video I'm going to compare some

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.809 
in this video I'm going to compare some
of<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> properties<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.440> two<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> alkali

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
of the properties of two of the alkali

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.980 
of the properties of two of the alkali
metals<00:00:06.240> lithium<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.319> sodium<00:00:08.059> lithium<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
metals lithium and sodium lithium is the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.259 
metals lithium and sodium lithium is the
lightest<00:00:10.679> metal<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.910> actually<00:00:12.150> number

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
lightest metal it's actually number

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.759 
lightest metal it's actually number
three<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> periodic<00:00:13.230> table

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
three on the periodic table

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
three on the periodic table
just<00:00:14.070> after<00:00:14.250> hydrogen<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> helium<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
just after hydrogen and helium and you

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.390 
just after hydrogen and helium and you
can<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.770> light<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.190> actually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
can see it's so light that it actually

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
can see it's so light that it actually
floats<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.510> oil<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
floats in the oil that I have it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.519 
floats in the oil that I have it
immersed<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:22.460> sodium<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:25.140> directly

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
immersed in here sodium is directly

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
immersed in here sodium is directly
below<00:00:25.680> lithium<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> periodic<00:00:26.670> table<00:00:26.820> its

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
below lithium on the periodic table its

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
below lithium on the periodic table its
atomic<00:00:27.810> number<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.199> 11<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.759> heavy

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
atomic number is 11 and it is heavy

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
atomic number is 11 and it is heavy
enough<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.690> won't<00:00:33.840> float<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
enough where it won't float I have a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
enough where it won't float I have a
couple<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> pieces<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.239> floating<00:00:37.170> around

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
couple of pieces here floating around

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
couple of pieces here floating around
some<00:00:37.590> oil<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
some oil and what I'm going to do is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
some oil and what I'm going to do is
drop<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.320> flask<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.860> water<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> we'll

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
drop them in a flask of water and we'll

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
drop them in a flask of water and we'll
compare<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> reactions<00:00:43.020> between<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:46.489> so

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
compare the reactions between them so

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
compare the reactions between them so
you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> lithium<00:00:48.510> isn't<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> form

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you can see the lithium isn't a form

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
you can see the lithium isn't a form
that's<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:50.850> thin

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that's you know it's just a very thin

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.470 
that's you know it's just a very thin
foil<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.710> looks<00:00:55.890> darker<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.329> only

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
foil and it looks darker but that's only

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.500 
foil and it looks darker but that's only
because<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:59.070> tarnished<00:00:59.640> both<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
because it's more tarnished both of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.399 
because it's more tarnished both of
these<00:01:00.600> metals<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.949> lift<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> air<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:03.600> very

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
these metals if lift in air will very

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
these metals if lift in air will very
rapidly<00:01:04.939> tarnish<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.180> form<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> hydroxides

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
rapidly tarnish and form the hydroxides

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
rapidly tarnish and form the hydroxides
on<00:01:07.860> their<00:01:07.979> surface<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:10.340> my<00:01:11.340> lithium<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.850> was

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
on their surface so my lithium was was

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.550 
on their surface so my lithium was was
left<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:12.930> longer<00:01:13.170> than<00:01:13.470> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
left out a little bit longer than it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130 
left out a little bit longer than it
should<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
should have been so you can see that it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.620 
should have been so you can see that it
has<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> dark<00:01:17.060> hydroxide<00:01:18.560> coating<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.630> so

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
has this dark hydroxide coating on it so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
has this dark hydroxide coating on it so
what<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.280> two

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
what I'm gonna do is take these two

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
what I'm gonna do is take these two
pieces<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.170> drop<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> water<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pieces and drop them in the water and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
pieces and drop them in the water and
we'll<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.180> they<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:30.200> assuming<00:01:31.200> they

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we'll see what they do assuming they

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.840 
we'll see what they do assuming they
want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.619> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 

so<00:01:36.810> what's<00:01:36.960> happening<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.620> reacting<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so what's happening is it's reacting the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
so what's happening is it's reacting the
lithium<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.580> reacting<00:01:38.940> with<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.540> form

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
lithium is reacting with water to form

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.820 
lithium is reacting with water to form
lifting<00:01:40.050> my<00:01:40.170> dioxide<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> hydrogen<00:01:41.130> gas<00:01:42.830> it's

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
lifting my dioxide and hydrogen gas it's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.930 
lifting my dioxide and hydrogen gas it's
a<00:01:43.890> pretty<00:01:44.070> vigorous<00:01:44.280> reaction<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
a pretty vigorous reaction and it

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.940 
a pretty vigorous reaction and it
generates<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.660> of<00:01:48.750> heat<00:01:48.950> now

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
generates a little bit of heat now

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.390 
generates a little bit of heat now
sodium<00:01:51.410> will<00:01:52.410> go<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.650> undergo<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.190> same

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
sodium will go and undergo the same

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.190 
sodium will go and undergo the same
reaction<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.940> will<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.210> quite<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.050> bit<00:01:58.080> more

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
reaction but it will be quite a bit more

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.820 
reaction but it will be quite a bit more
vigorous<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.720> obviously<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> forms<00:02:01.650> a

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
vigorous and it obviously it forms a

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.120 
vigorous and it obviously it forms a
sodium<00:02:02.280> hydroxide<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.240> lithium<00:02:03.900> hydroxide

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
sodium hydroxide not lithium hydroxide

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
sodium hydroxide not lithium hydroxide
so<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.280> happens<00:02:05.580> with<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> sodium<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.930> it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so what happens with the sodium is as it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.199 
so what happens with the sodium is as it
evolves<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.800> hydrogen<00:02:08.190> gas<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:09.060> also

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
evolves the hydrogen gas it also

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
evolves the hydrogen gas it also
generates<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> good<00:02:09.869> amount<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> heat<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
generates a good amount of heat and that

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.190 
generates a good amount of heat and that
heat<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.910> usually<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.930> large

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
heat is usually if you have a large

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.310 
heat is usually if you have a large
enough<00:02:13.440> piece<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:14.010> usually<00:02:15.000> enough<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.930> ignite

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
enough piece is usually enough to ignite

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.550 
enough piece is usually enough to ignite
the<00:02:16.500> hydrogen<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.230> see<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.410> immediately

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the hydrogen you can see it immediately

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590 
the hydrogen you can see it immediately
melts<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.190> balls<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.670> into<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> nice<00:02:21.120> sphere

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.870 

it's<00:02:42.320> last<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.740> little<00:02:42.830> bit<00:02:42.950> longer<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.490> because

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's last a little bit longer to because

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180 
it's last a little bit longer to because
of<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> heat<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.480> reaction<00:02:45.070> forms<00:02:46.070> it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
of the heat of the reaction forms it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.040 
of the heat of the reaction forms it
into<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> sphere<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.240> gives<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
into a sphere and that gives it the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.740 
into a sphere and that gives it the
least<00:02:48.980> amount<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.250> surface<00:02:49.490> area<00:02:49.910> at<00:02:50.480> least<00:02:50.660> in

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
least amount of surface area at least in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.740 
least amount of surface area at least in
my<00:02:50.840> contact<00:02:51.410> with<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.590> water<00:02:51.830> possible<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
my contact with the water possible so it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.180 
my contact with the water possible so it
tends<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.020> go<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> little<00:02:54.620> bit<00:02:54.740> longer<00:02:54.950> with

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
tends to go for a little bit longer with

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.710 
tends to go for a little bit longer with
this<00:02:55.370> even<00:02:55.700> though<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.450> bit<00:02:56.570> more

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
this even though it's it's a bit more

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.979 
this even though it's it's a bit more
reactive

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.599 

and<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.590> guess<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.769> piece<00:03:04.099> was<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.489> little

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
and I guess that piece was just a little

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.670 
and I guess that piece was just a little
bit<00:03:04.730> too<00:03:04.879> small<00:03:05.500> what

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
bit too small what

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.349 
bit too small what
anyways<00:03:07.069> hope<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.579> was<00:03:07.670> illustrative<00:03:08.209> and

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
anyways hope that was illustrative and

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.989 
anyways hope that was illustrative and
thanks<00:03:08.840> for<00:03:08.930> watching
