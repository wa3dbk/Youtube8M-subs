there and a couple of yellow ones but
but<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:21.220> always<00:02:21.720> I'm<00:02:22.720> always<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.260> lowest<00:02:23.470> as

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
but I'm always I'm always the lowest as

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.250 
but I'm always I'm always the lowest as
far<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.370> time<00:02:24.819> goes<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.209> always<00:02:25.420> at<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
far as time goes I'm always at the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.800 
far as time goes I'm always at the
bottom<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> barrel<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.400> say<00:02:27.610> put<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.600> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
bottom of the barrel to say put it that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.080 
bottom of the barrel to say put it that
way<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.160> feel<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.520> I'm<00:02:30.700> always<00:02:30.819> at<00:02:31.030> a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
way and so I feel like I'm always at a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
way and so I feel like I'm always at a
disadvantage<00:02:31.470> even<00:02:32.470> though<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:34.709> even<00:02:35.709> though<00:02:35.800> I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
disadvantage even though I even though I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.550 
disadvantage even though I even though I
