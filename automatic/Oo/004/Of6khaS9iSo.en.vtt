I also use cake foundations and I'm

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.550 
I also use cake foundations and I'm
going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.939> several<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.290> screen

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
going to show you several this is screen

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.530 
going to show you several this is screen
faced<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.430> can<00:00:05.640> also<00:00:05.819> get<00:00:06.060> their<00:00:06.299> nine

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
faced and you can also get their nine

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.020 
faced and you can also get their nine
now<00:00:07.170> these<00:00:07.500> are<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:08.540> as<00:00:09.540> Matt's<00:00:09.960> finish

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
now these are more as Matt's finish

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
now these are more as Matt's finish
foundations<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.870> think<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.710> best<00:00:13.920> for

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
foundations and I think this is best for

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.300 
foundations and I think this is best for
TV<00:00:14.490> makeup<00:00:14.849> honestly<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.260> want<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.680> full<00:00:17.100> on

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
TV makeup honestly if you want a full on

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.880 
TV makeup honestly if you want a full on
coverage<00:00:18.060> then<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.650> not

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
coverage then use this it's not

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
coverage then use this it's not
something<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:20.850> everyday<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
something for everyday I think this is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.689 
something for everyday I think this is
best<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.619> something<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.400> kit

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
best for something to have in your kit

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
best for something to have in your kit
it<00:00:24.060> works<00:00:24.359> almost<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.869> concealer<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.890> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
it works almost like a concealer that is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.029 
it works almost like a concealer that is
how<00:00:26.369> thick<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> stuff<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.980> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
how thick this stuff is and this this is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.690 
how thick this stuff is and this this is
the<00:00:29.220> packaging<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.920> golden<00:00:32.340> Evan

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the packaging and this is golden Evan

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.080 
the packaging and this is golden Evan
evany<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.719> screen<00:00:34.020> face<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:35.489> find<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
evany and a screen face and I find that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.160 
evany and a screen face and I find that
it's<00:00:36.600> his<00:00:36.750> best<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:38.120> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> sponge<00:00:39.629> not

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it's his best use with a sponge not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
it's his best use with a sponge not
necessarily<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> brush<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.120> too

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
necessarily a brush you don't need too

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.990 
necessarily a brush you don't need too
much<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:44.340> goes<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> long<00:00:44.640> way

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
much at all a little goes a long way

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.150 
much at all a little goes a long way
even<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.660> you're<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> photo

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
even if you're using it for like a photo

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
even if you're using it for like a photo
shoot<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.879> something<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.840> it'll

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
shoot or something like that then it'll

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.850 
shoot or something like that then it'll
be<00:00:49.350> fine

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
be fine

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
be fine

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
foundation if you are a beginner I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.540

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
wouldn't really suggest foundation like

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.550 
wouldn't really suggest foundation like
this<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.959> kind<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.170> works<00:03:48.410> as<00:03:48.500> a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
this because it kind of works as a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.050 
this because it kind of works as a
concealer<00:03:48.980> as<00:03:49.220> well<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.910> foundation

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
concealer as well not just a foundation

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.260 
concealer as well not just a foundation
it<00:03:50.660> conceals<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.530> camouflages<00:03:52.400> blemishes

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
it conceals and camouflages blemishes

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.880 
it conceals and camouflages blemishes
and<00:03:53.510> scars<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.080> things<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.440> that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
and scars and things like that

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.790 
and scars and things like that
so<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.180> kind<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.450> need<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.930> little<00:03:56.989> bit<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.560> more

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
so you kind of need a little bit of more

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.860 
so you kind of need a little bit of more
advanced<00:03:58.280> knowledge<00:03:58.610> in<00:03:58.790> makeup<00:03:59.270> if<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.630> want
