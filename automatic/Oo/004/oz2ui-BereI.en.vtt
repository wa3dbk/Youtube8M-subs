so this is stuff water lettuce I keep in
my<00:00:05.970> shrimp<00:00:06.330> tanks<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.049> help<00:00:07.379> load<00:00:07.589> out<00:00:07.890> any

nitrite<00:00:09.840> level<00:00:11.059> so<00:00:12.059> they<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.750> stay<00:00:13.410> pretty

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
nitrite level so they can stay pretty

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.200 
nitrite level so they can stay pretty
much<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.509> zero<00:00:15.509> or<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.839> little<00:00:16.260> bit<00:00:16.379> more<00:00:17.210> but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
much at zero or a little bit more but

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.880 
much at zero or a little bit more but
they're<00:00:18.449> great<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.930> lower<00:00:19.350> down<00:00:19.710> your

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
they're great for lower down your

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.080 
they're great for lower down your
nitrite<00:00:20.369> level<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.800> propagate<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.670> type

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
nitrite level and to propagate this type

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.000 
nitrite level and to propagate this type
of<00:00:24.119> 40<00:00:24.840> plants<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.560> pretty<00:00:25.890> easy<00:00:28.010> they

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
of 40 plants it's pretty easy they

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.979 
of 40 plants it's pretty easy they
produce<00:00:29.480> offshoots<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.840> baby<00:00:32.600> let<00:00:33.600> me<00:00:33.719> find

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
produce offshoots or baby let me find

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
produce offshoots or baby let me find
your<00:00:34.140> example<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:38.059> here's<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:41.390> see<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
your example here here's one see this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
your example here here's one see this
one<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.250> baby<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:44.850> here

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
one right here that's a baby right here

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.069 
one right here that's a baby right here
now<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.190> either<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:49.460> finger<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
now you can either use your finger and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
now you can either use your finger and
Terry<00:00:52.079> off<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> scissor

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
Terry off or you can use a scissor

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.240 
Terry off or you can use a scissor
I<00:00:54.649> usually<00:00:55.649> usually<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> scissor

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I usually usually use a scissor

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.979 
I usually usually use a scissor
because<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.340> won't<00:00:59.579> contaminate<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.629> shrimp

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
because I won't contaminate my shrimp

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.460 
because I won't contaminate my shrimp
tank<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.449> cut<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
tank so you just cut off at that and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.760 
tank so you just cut off at that and
that's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.430> new<00:01:05.670> plane<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that's a new plane right there and it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
that's a new plane right there and it
will<00:01:07.920> grow<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.369> old<00:01:08.630> baby<00:01:09.630> after<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> while<00:01:11.869> now

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
will grow as old baby after a while now

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
will grow as old baby after a while now
occasionally<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.520> some

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
occasionally you will have you have some

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.039 
occasionally you will have you have some
other<00:01:17.850> type<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:19.430> wall<00:01:20.430> ester<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.299> yellow<00:01:21.689> or

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
other type of wall ester or yellow or

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.090 
other type of wall ester or yellow or
the<00:01:22.710> true<00:01:23.070> white<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.680> remove

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the true white and you would remove

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.899 
the true white and you would remove
those<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.990> those<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.829> kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> clout

let's go back with tang right here there
we<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.870> that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
we go just like that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.540 
we go just like that

very low if you keep the curve very fast
it<00:02:54.780> kills<00:02:55.140> them<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.300> tried<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:57.959> feel

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
times it later killed them all there is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.040 
times it later killed them all there is
no<00:03:05.610> way<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.150> survive<00:03:06.270> without<00:03:06.600> that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
no way they can survive without that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.300 
no way they can survive without that
strong<00:03:07.680> current<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.650> sure<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.950> keep<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
strong current so be sure to keep the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.170 
strong current so be sure to keep the
curve<00:03:11.550> very<00:03:11.820> very<00:03:12.090> slow<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:14.850> there's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
curve very very slow you can see there's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.199 
curve very very slow you can see there's
not<00:03:15.450> much<00:03:15.720> surface<00:03:16.500> move<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.890> or<00:03:17.010> anything<00:03:20.209> so

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
not much surface move it or anything so

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.790 
not much surface move it or anything so
that's<00:03:21.450> pretty<00:03:21.690> much<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.080> if<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.440> guys<00:03:22.530> have

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
that's pretty much it if you guys have

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.360 
that's pretty much it if you guys have
