00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello themselves more often video stream 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.800
 urgently there ram look like he 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800
 looks like 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.480
 this trick 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.689
 very similar in principle to tomorrow but we 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.079
 longer 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.050
 read and take a pen slot 2 3 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.039
 their leaders with their thumb 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.220
 start doing all this morant norm 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.200
 that he is so 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 but time but after the pen commit 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.940
 turn around the thumb on 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.850
 this movement does not end 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.010
 do it one more extra 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.310
 around the index finger 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 white shirt slot 1 2 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.490
 so take the pen 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490
 Yes, I received as there it is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.070
 and at this time the main thing to remember 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.200
 connect thumb 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.120
 with index 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.030
 if this is not done then after 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.500
 the troops will turn around 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.290
 thumb on stuck 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.870
 otherwise it can't move anywhere 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.390
 means we connect the thumb 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.660
 forefinger 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.380
 at this time a pen with three more does it by 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.550
 inertia 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.130
 make a turn 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 start turning your hand 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 without this handle treat 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.080
 and it appears flies from from 1 2 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.690
 remember more than once running 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 this middle and thumb index 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.860
 and when the pen made a turn 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.710
 around the thumb 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.270
 means what to do mu transfer 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 flips hand 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.820
 you have a principle and all the luck
