00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 this is anime post cabrio where is 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.230
 detracting review the fighter 416 where 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.250
 we can see the end of an era we can 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.110
 see that a week has passed and it has 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.070
 seen that the cities are destroyed 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.100
 that diego is well destroyed the teacher 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 in this one he asks the teacher if he's going 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.670
 to rebuild the script tells them not to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.310
 that he is sure he is not going to 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 rebuild we can also see 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.960
 that everyone is like that is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 associating what has happened 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 because this is a battle of tartar 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.910
 it left the entire city destroyed 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 other cities because we can see 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.340
 Also most today was not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.330
 destroyed whole 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.670
 we can also see that this one is 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.880
 conversing with the pleasure he has 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.130
 the brand and now I feel a little better 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.050
 for the conversation he had with him 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.860
 we can see that the csu is with happy 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.830
 talking about money buying ps and of 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.060
 this is an adventure they are going to go to 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.400
 train for a year or who knows more 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.720
 because he was not sure when he 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.910
 he left light and we can also see the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.980
 revelation that we see at the end of the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.820
 charter 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.900
 What is it 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 which is called the true name of the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.740
 what's it called I'm going to read it from 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:55.550
 the phone is called in ethereal nac 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.670
 subtraction that says no that being 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.820
 it was not nor am I very interesting because 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.440
 we did not know that part of the story 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.610
 we can also see that chapter bit 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.539
 long is 32 pages 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.680
 complete 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.950
 we can see what 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.659
 they are all talking as much as associating 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 I think there's going to be a stage skip 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.250
 rating I do not know if it's going to be going to be 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.430
 separated all will be fine 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.690
 interesting what will happen now 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.800
 Forward why 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.880
 very strong is not known what will happen to 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.680
 now forwards because you see this 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.400
 baby as a 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.090
 or something different I think that felipe does not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.819
 it's going to be the same, it's going to be better 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.390
 perhaps the haters of faith avoid that 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.209
 they always look for something saying that it is 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.200
 a crap that is one of these do not you 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.560
 it has been the best 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.980
 arc in a long time 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.410
 of faith dress we can also see that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.500
 rain this one tells you the truth 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.739
 to defeat and that was what killed the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.099
 father then thanks that part to 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.630
 because she did not know it for now 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:28.790
 understands and does not feel guilty 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:33.550
 now he's happy too that I think 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.060
 the charter I give 10 out of 10 because there 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.930
 that is charro strategist abdomen is 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.810
 there a lot of information that I did not know very 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.880
 especially this revelation at the end 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.730
 what is naxxo 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.360
 then there are many people who were 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.270
 predicting to that and that I give 7 10 the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.330
 people who predicted it put is 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.330
 anime is shine kill
