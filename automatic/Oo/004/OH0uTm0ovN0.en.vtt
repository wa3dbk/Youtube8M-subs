going<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.640> hot<00:01:58.850> glue<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.300> bottom<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.869> your

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
going to hot glue the bottom of your

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.260 
going to hot glue the bottom of your
square<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.160> that<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.610> put<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.940> on<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
square so that you can put it on the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.850 
square so that you can put it on the
base<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.780> box<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.229> make<00:02:03.290> sure<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.650> flip

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
base of the box and make sure to flip

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.710 
base of the box and make sure to flip
yours<00:02:04.070> upside<00:02:04.520> down<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.510> faces

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
yours upside down so that it faces

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.420 
yours upside down so that it faces
upright<00:02:06.350> because<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.650> can<00:02:06.830> see<00:02:07.010> when<00:02:07.160> I<00:02:07.190> want

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
upright because you can see when I want

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.219 
upright because you can see when I want
to<00:02:07.580> glue<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.940> was<00:02:08.149> upside<00:02:08.600> down<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:09.110> that's

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
to glue it was upside down so that's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
to glue it was upside down so that's
another<00:02:09.560> mistake<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.190> made<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.729> make

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
another mistake that I made and make

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.120 
another mistake that I made and make
sure<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:11.870> pretty<00:02:12.170> well<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:12.920> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
sure that it's pretty well on there and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.770 
sure that it's pretty well on there and
then<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.640> add<00:02:13.820> some<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.600> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
then you can just add some of the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.870 
then you can just add some of the
plastic<00:02:15.350> Ross<00:02:15.590> kind<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.400> as<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> filler

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
plastic Ross kind of just as a filler

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.420 
plastic Ross kind of just as a filler
and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.230> ahead<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.860> glue<00:02:19.160> on

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and then you can go ahead and glue on

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.880 
and then you can go ahead and glue on
your<00:02:19.459> ropes<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.390> just<00:02:21.110> kind<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.410> place<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
your ropes and just kind of place it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.199 
your ropes and just kind of place it
where<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.040> think<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.459> might<00:02:22.610> want<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
where you think you might want it and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:42.860 
where you think you might want it and
then<00:02:23.360> go<00:02:23.510> ahead<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.840> hot<00:02:24.200> glue<00:02:24.440> those

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.080 

for<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.990> top<00:02:44.260> part<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> basket<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.700> decided

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
for the top part of the basket I decided

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.790 
for the top part of the basket I decided
to<00:02:46.240> cover<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> plastic<00:02:47.140> grass<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.620> some

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
to cover the plastic grass with some

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.650 
to cover the plastic grass with some
edible<00:02:47.920> grass<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:48.970> fill<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> entire

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
edible grass you can fill up the entire

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.420 
edible grass you can fill up the entire
basket<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.350> edible<00:02:50.709> grass<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.220> thought

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
basket with edible grass that I thought

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.770 
basket with edible grass that I thought
it<00:02:51.520> looked<00:02:51.610> nice<00:02:51.880> toward<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.300> green<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
it looked nice toward the green on the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.360 
it looked nice toward the green on the
bottom<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.410> I'm<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.709> putting<00:02:53.860> some<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.190> that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
bottom so I'm just putting some of that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.130 
bottom so I'm just putting some of that
in<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.730> then<00:02:54.819> I'm<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:54.940> placing<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> Easter

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
in and then I'm just placing the Easter

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.960 
in and then I'm just placing the Easter
eggs<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> basket<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.670> obviously

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
eggs in the basket and you can obviously

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.280 
eggs in the basket and you can obviously
place<00:02:58.240> whatever<00:02:58.570> you'd<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
place whatever you'd like to in the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.440 
place whatever you'd like to in the
basket<00:02:59.770> then<00:03:00.250> I'm<00:03:00.370> taking<00:03:00.700> some<00:03:00.940> leftover

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
basket then I'm taking some leftover

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.449 
basket then I'm taking some leftover
edible<00:03:01.780> Easter<00:03:02.110> grass<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.560> tying<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.100> and

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
edible Easter grass and tying that and

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.490 
edible Easter grass and tying that and
this<00:03:03.910> does<00:03:04.120> take<00:03:04.360> some<00:03:04.540> patience<00:03:05.050> because<00:03:05.320> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
this does take some patience because it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.199 
this does take some patience because it
breaks<00:03:05.709> easily<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.459> think<00:03:06.700> it's<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.970> really

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
breaks easily but I think it's a really

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.540 
breaks easily but I think it's a really
nice<00:03:07.360> touch<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.050> handles<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.070> basket

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
nice touch on the handles of the basket

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.729 
nice touch on the handles of the basket
I'm<00:03:09.670> gonna<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.060> ahead<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> trim<00:03:10.930> my<00:03:11.140> grass<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
I'm gonna go ahead and trim my grass and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.800 
I'm gonna go ahead and trim my grass and
that<00:03:12.069> is<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.340> finish<00:03:12.640> edible<00:03:13.060> Easter<00:03:13.390> basket
