00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
go over to these guys over here i got to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640 
go over to these guys over here i got to
get<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.489> strategy<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.410> you're<00:02:25.560> going

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
get into strategy so what you're going

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.740 
get into strategy so what you're going
to<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.879> you're<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> be<00:02:27.360> high<00:02:27.540> enough

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to do is you're going to be high enough

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660 
to do is you're going to be high enough
so<00:02:27.959> then<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> person<00:02:28.560> will<00:02:28.709> die<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> fall

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so then the person will die a fall

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.960 
so then the person will die a fall
damage<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.709> either<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:32.700> on

damage and you can either do this on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.020 
damage and you can either do this on
your<00:02:33.000> own<00:02:33.239> tower<00:02:34.019> or<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:35.430> someone<00:02:35.790> else's
