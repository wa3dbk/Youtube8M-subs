00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
to do the more professionally but it is

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.700 
to do the more professionally but it is
an<00:00:49.640> extraordinarily<00:00:50.330> hard<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.350> yield<00:00:51.530> to

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
an extraordinarily hard for yield to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.799 
an extraordinarily hard for yield to
break<00:00:51.890> into<00:00:52.100> if<00:00:52.370> you're<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.580> female<00:00:52.909> and<00:00:53.239> the
