well<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.270> isn't<00:00:57.420> exactly<00:00:57.570> flying<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
well this isn't exactly flying but the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
well this isn't exactly flying but the
least<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> flying<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> wind<00:00:59.670> right

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
least kind of flying the wind right

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
least kind of flying the wind right
anyway<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.890> appears<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.260> they

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
anyway all right so it appears that they

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.310 
anyway all right so it appears that they
are<00:01:04.500> pumping<00:01:05.040> silver<00:01:05.670> again<00:01:06.110> silvers<00:01:07.110> about

was pumping these other stocks which I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
was pumping these other stocks which I
know<00:01:26.759> nothing<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.650> going

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
know nothing about and I I'm not going

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
know nothing about and I I'm not going
to<00:01:28.950> find<00:01:29.100> anything<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.420> he's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to find anything about but now he's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
to find anything about but now he's
talking<00:01:30.810> silver<00:01:31.439> again<00:01:31.759> perhaps<00:01:32.759> he<00:01:33.210> made<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
talking silver again perhaps he made a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.830 
talking silver again perhaps he made a
big<00:01:33.750> purchase<00:01:34.310> because<00:01:35.310> why<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.060> pump

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
big purchase because why would he pump

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
big purchase because why would he pump
stuff<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.470> didn't<00:01:37.680> purchase<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.130> purchase

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
stuff if he didn't purchase a purchase

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
stuff if he didn't purchase a purchase
it<00:01:38.970> beforehand<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.750> he<00:01:40.590> must<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.860> made<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> big

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it beforehand so he must have made a big

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.840 
it beforehand so he must have made a big
silver<00:01:41.759> purchased<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.140> teens<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
silver purchased in the teens and now is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.100
