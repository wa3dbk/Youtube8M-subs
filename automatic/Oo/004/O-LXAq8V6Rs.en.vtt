00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.189
 or it is very hot and all 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.960
 they like to eat ice cream in this time 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.160
 so we decided to make these ice creams 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.950
 who are vegan are sugar free 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 and they are very easy to do so if 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.140
 they want to learn how to do them 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.140
 miss the next video 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.200
 we have a lot of data for you 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.200
 d 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 two 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.199
 this is for you 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.810
 already 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.150
 good to do these palettes what 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.460
 first thing you need to do is do 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.050
 coconut milk we already have a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.310
 video of how to make coconut list like this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.400
 that you can see it if you click here 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.470
 and this is what I did, I left it in 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.900
 the refrigerator and milk like that 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.520
 begins to separate the fat and it 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.400
 starts hitting a little there you porte 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.350
 thing to be returned 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 so now let's make pallets 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 of two flavors I open chocolate 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.460
 which is what I showed at the beginning 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.480
 video and now we're going to do two 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.160
 flavors because for that we are going to take the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.430
 amount of coconut milk that fits here 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.430
 in the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.050
 they are called these 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.580
 I need an ice cream 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.090
 and we're going to make two chocolate and two 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.090
 of lucuma 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.969
 I'm doing this here and not in a 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.719
 blender because what I did yesterday what 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.149
 I did 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.429
 with the blender and liquefy it is formed 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.360
 a lot of foam and then it's normal to put it 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.600
 here it freezes as 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.050
 as strangely I recommend you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.050
 best 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.920
 the chocolate 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.290
 when everything depends on the quantities 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.210
 that I'm going to use here a spoonful of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.210
 bitter cocoa powder 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.080
 and I'm going to put you can use stevia in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.360
 powder or to powder depends on what 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.140
 you want 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.140
 and in 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.330
 then I will do it with the body 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.910
 in this case 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.950
 and you have to put him at ease 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.520
 they're going to have to go crying because everything 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.130
 It depends on the molds you have 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.250
 let's put half a teaspoon 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.390
 with a teaspoon of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.390
 agave powder 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.670
 this revolves until it dissolves 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.670
 cocoa 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.920
 for those who do not know this cocoa in 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.380
 dust is that we are are we is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.290
 organic 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.330
 and it is raw and since it is 100% cocoa it costs 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.090
 to dissolve I'm fixing you 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.709
 not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 it does not dissolve easily 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 this is because cocoa 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.159
 this because the cocoa is not alkalized 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.290
 dow if you look there there are containers 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.730
 of cocoa that says cocoa alkalized and 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.000
 that process is done so that the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.840
 chocolate dissolves better in media 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.819
 liquid however that process of 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.530
 alkalization makes all 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.440
 antioxidant properties of cocoa is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.910
 lose then if you want to eat 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.280
 cocoa for all the antioxidants 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.049
 that they have magnesium for all 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.150
 nutrients then they have to consume 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.590
 this type of kaka or cocoa alkalizes 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.780
 or if you are more convenient because you 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.290
 dissolves easier is not going to bring them 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.290
 the same nutrients 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.060
 then they just stir us up 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.060
 that is as dissolved as possible 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.750
 and how it does not dissolve well if you 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.060
 they fix on the one I showed the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.070
 principle is because they are here that 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.210
 I also did it yesterday it goes a little bit 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.970
 cocoa to the bottom 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.199
 and that because this cocoa does not not 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.199
 Dissolve in the same way 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.210
 this does not bother me but the other thing that 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.050
 can do is study this so that 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.050
 dissolve better 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.130
 so if you want they can put it in 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.600
 like in the microwave or in the oven or in 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.600
 the fire and localista 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.150
 and to make those of lucuma the 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.950
 same process you put a spoonful of 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.910
 Lucuma powder in the amount needed 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.530
 of coconut milk add the 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.800
 sweetener and then they put the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.800
 ballistic 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.949
 and after putting these palettes 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.590
 this is necessary to take it by 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.660
 approximately 56 hours to the freezer 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.350
 if they take it out before the pallets are going to 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.740
 leave alone and they will not be with someone 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.129
 on the side and the side will not reach 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.740
 freeze cordeta 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.350
 so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.919
 I do not think it's necessary to be him 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.100
 so 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:52.770
 only the light is changed and then for 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.050
 take out these palettes what they have to 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.630
 to do is to leave a moment outside the 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.470
 freezer or put it a little with the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.470
 side of the key 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.400
 so that it goes thawing and then 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.400
 the 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.719
 and it looks good 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.930
 it matters to me 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.060
 that was the video today I hope that they 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.730
 have liked to be encouraged because they can 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.580
 make many preparations and can use 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.759
 as a base also the milk of almonds 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.849
 or another type of milk and can 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:34.639
 sweeten with stevia with honey with 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:39.129
 Agave can add pieces of 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.129
 chopped fruit or what can 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 here 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.170
 but this creative carob tree 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.730
 do not forget to like this one 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.280
 video to follow us on the channel 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:05.300
 youtube and we're watching for the 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:10.419
 next video thanks for joining us 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.419
 that's how good you went through here 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:19.139
 come back to compare us there are many things 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.139
 more to discover
