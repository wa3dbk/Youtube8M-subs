so<00:00:03.570> what<00:00:03.990> we're<00:00:04.140> trying<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:04.650> here<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
so what we're trying to do here is to

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.870 
so what we're trying to do here is to
really<00:00:05.310> build<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.850> lineage<00:00:06.290> and<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:07.730> what<00:00:08.730> we've

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
really build a lineage and so what we've

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.580 
really build a lineage and so what we've
done<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.330> created<00:00:09.660> phone<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
done is created phone that from a

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.140 
done is created phone that from a
distance<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.849> clearly

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
distance is going to be clearly

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.230 
distance is going to be clearly
identifiable<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> one<00:00:13.530> product<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:15.089> an

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
identifiable as a one product so it's an

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.609 
identifiable as a one product so it's an
icon<00:00:15.599> that's<00:00:15.780> been<00:00:15.990> established<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
icon that's been established in the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.310 
icon that's been established in the
market<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.789> want<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> continue<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.660> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
market and we want to continue that but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.720 
market and we want to continue that but
if<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> come<00:00:19.680> up<00:00:19.740> close<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.400> you're<00:00:20.609> going

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
if you come up close to it you're going

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.550 
if you come up close to it you're going
to<00:00:20.789> notice<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.660> subtle<00:00:21.990> details<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
to notice all the subtle details that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.540 
to notice all the subtle details that
we've<00:00:22.680> evolved<00:00:24.859> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> obviously<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.430> good

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
we've evolved this is obviously a good

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.150 
we've evolved this is obviously a good
franchise<00:00:27.140> working<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.289> where<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
franchise working out where you have you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
franchise working out where you have you
taken<00:00:29.400> icon<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.269> keep<00:00:30.900> refining<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
taken icon and you keep refining the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
taken icon and you keep refining the
things<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.340> refined<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.510> don't

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
things that need to be refined you don't

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
things that need to be refined you don't
overhaul<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> basic<00:00:34.800> gesture<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
overhaul the basic gesture the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.090 
overhaul the basic gesture the
fundamental<00:00:36.360> expression<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> phone<00:00:37.860> if

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
fundamental expression of the phone if

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
fundamental expression of the phone if
you<00:00:38.250> don't<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.420> really

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you don't have to if it's really really

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
you don't have to if it's really really
good<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.010> we've<00:00:41.129> done<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.760> look

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
good and so what we've done is to look

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
good and so what we've done is to look
at<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> different<00:00:42.809> aspects<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
at a lot of different aspects of the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
at a lot of different aspects of the
phones<00:00:43.710> areas<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.430> could<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.730> improved<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
phones areas that could be improved so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
phones areas that could be improved so
the<00:00:45.600> m7<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> lot<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> accolades<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.280> its

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the m7 got a lot of accolades for its

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
the m7 got a lot of accolades for its
precision<00:00:47.910> aesthetics<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.879> m8<00:00:51.480> got

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
precision aesthetics and then the m8 got

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
precision aesthetics and then the m8 got
a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> accolades<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.430> being<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a lot of accolades for being really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
a lot of accolades for being really
comfortable<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> hand<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.930> people<00:00:55.260> tend

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
comfortable in the hand but people tend

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
comfortable in the hand but people tend
to<00:00:55.680> lose<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:57.000> too<00:00:57.120> easily

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to lose it a little bit too easily

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
to lose it a little bit too easily
including<00:00:57.960> myself<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.559> dropped<00:00:58.829> mine<00:00:59.010> too<00:00:59.190> many

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
including myself I dropped mine too many

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
including myself I dropped mine too many
times<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.480> what<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.750> did<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.050> m9<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
times and so what we did with m9 is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.840 
times and so what we did with m9 is
really<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> combine<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> best<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.789> both

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
really to combine the best of both

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
really to combine the best of both
worlds<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.539> were<00:01:03.629> able<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.920> sort<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
worlds we were able to take the sort of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.140 
worlds we were able to take the sort of
crisp<00:01:05.780> edge<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.350> m7<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> left<00:01:08.460> precision<00:01:08.939> look

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
crisp edge of m7 and left precision look

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.649 
crisp edge of m7 and left precision look
and<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:10.590> add<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.400> softness<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> m8<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and then also add the softness of m8 and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
and then also add the softness of m8 and
create<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> product<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
create a product that really is going to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.060 
create a product that really is going to
feel<00:01:14.490> great<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> hand<00:01:15.350> scooters<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.740> little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
feel great in the hand scooters a little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.710 
feel great in the hand scooters a little
bit<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> manufacturing<00:01:18.180> process<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
bit about the manufacturing process and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
bit about the manufacturing process and
that<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:19.799> changed<00:01:19.830> between<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that how that has changed between the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.240 
that how that has changed between the
one<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> made<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.540> mine<00:01:22.040> yeah<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
one I made in the one in mine yeah the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.700 
one I made in the one in mine yeah the
manufacturing<00:01:24.000> has<00:01:24.720> evolved<00:01:25.290> quite<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> bit

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
manufacturing has evolved quite a bit

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
manufacturing has evolved quite a bit
actually<00:01:26.270> we're<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.390> making<00:01:27.689> things<00:01:27.840> easier

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
actually we're not making things easier

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.569 
actually we're not making things easier
on<00:01:28.530> ourselves<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.250> pure

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
on ourselves you can see our just a pure

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.280 
on ourselves you can see our just a pure

unibody has gone from 150 minutes on the

unibody has gone from 150 minutes on the
original<00:01:38.430> m7<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> 300<00:01:40.500> minutes

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650

on<00:01:41.100> their<00:01:41.310> line<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.840> we're

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
on their line and that's because we're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
on their line and that's because we're
doing<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.040> complex<00:01:44.460> process<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
doing a much more complex process this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
doing a much more complex process this
is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> an<00:01:46.079> industry<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:47.009> we're

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is a kind of an industry first if we're

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.610 
is a kind of an industry first if we're
doing<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.579> dual<00:01:47.790> anodized<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
doing a dual anodized a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.910 
doing a dual anodized a
on<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.670> main<00:01:49.850> housing<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:51.290> wanted<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.620> show

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
on the main housing so we wanted to show

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.880 
on the main housing so we wanted to show
of<00:01:52.280> different<00:01:53.000> qualities<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.720> metal<00:01:54.170> but

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
of different qualities of the metal but

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.110 
of different qualities of the metal but
we<00:01:55.010> also<00:01:55.160> didn't<00:01:55.550> want<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.790> introduce

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
we also didn't want to introduce

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.600 
we also didn't want to introduce
multiple<00:01:56.840> parts<00:01:57.290> on<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.980> phone<00:01:58.160> because<00:01:58.370> of

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
multiple parts on the phone because of

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.130 
multiple parts on the phone because of
course<00:01:58.850> we're<00:01:59.060> well<00:01:59.210> known<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.630> our<00:01:59.690> unibody

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
course we're well known for our unibody

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.040 
course we're well known for our unibody
and<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.160> what<00:02:01.340> we've<00:02:01.490> done<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.840> whole

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
and so what we've done is the whole

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.130 
and so what we've done is the whole
process<00:02:03.820> gets<00:02:04.820> done<00:02:05.090> twice<00:02:05.390> over<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
process gets done twice over the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.950 
process gets done twice over the
anodization<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.550> machining<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.210> then<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
anodization the machining and then the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.340 
anodization the machining and then the
finishing<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.670> see<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.000> iphone<00:02:11.390> 6<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.230> new

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
finishing so we see the iphone 6 the new

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.220 
finishing so we see the iphone 6 the new
galaxy<00:02:12.800> s6<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.850> need<00:02:14.030> advice<00:02:14.180> all<00:02:14.900> have

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
galaxy s6 and you need advice all have

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.380 
galaxy s6 and you need advice all have
cameras<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.190> protrude<00:02:16.640> slightly<00:02:16.760> from<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
cameras that protrude slightly from the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240 
cameras that protrude slightly from the
body<00:02:17.600> do<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.470> new<00:02:18.950> trend

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
body do you think that's a new trend

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.430 
body do you think that's a new trend
that's<00:02:19.490> about<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.850> well<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> lot<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.960> being<00:02:21.350> a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
that's about it well a lot of being a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.380 
that's about it well a lot of being a
designer<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.550> about<00:02:22.760> making<00:02:22.910> trade<00:02:23.240> off

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
designer is about making trade off

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.880 
designer is about making trade off
especially<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> smartphone<00:02:24.440> space

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
especially in the smartphone space

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.430 
especially in the smartphone space
because<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.390> limited<00:02:26.630> real<00:02:27.020> estate

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
because we have a limited real estate

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.250 
because we have a limited real estate
that<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.430> work<00:02:28.580> with<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.510> every<00:02:29.870> item

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
that we can work with and so every item

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.930 
that we can work with and so every item
has<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.590> be<00:02:30.680> considered<00:02:30.980> very<00:02:31.310> very<00:02:31.490> carefully

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
has to be considered very very carefully

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.990 
has to be considered very very carefully
as<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.990> go<00:02:33.170> bigger<00:02:33.560> sensors<00:02:34.340> everybody<00:02:34.790> wants

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
as you go bigger sensors everybody wants

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.310 
as you go bigger sensors everybody wants
to<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> great<00:02:35.360> camera<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.810> their<00:02:35.960> phone<00:02:35.990> so

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
to have a great camera on their phone so

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320 
to have a great camera on their phone so
I<00:02:36.380> feel<00:02:36.680> bigger<00:02:36.860> with<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> sensors<00:02:37.520> you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
I feel bigger with the sensors you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.210 
I feel bigger with the sensors you
inevitably<00:02:38.660> come<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:40.010> certain

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
inevitably come up to certain

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.970 
inevitably come up to certain
limitations<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.500> think<00:02:42.560> we're

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
limitations and and I think we're

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.890 
limitations and and I think we're
willing<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.460> make<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.640> sacrifice<00:02:43.880> right<00:02:44.720> now

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
willing to make that sacrifice right now

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.870 
willing to make that sacrifice right now
is<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:45.200> little<00:02:45.260> bit<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.800> bump<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.310> would<00:02:46.730> say

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
is a little bit of a bump I would say

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.680 
is a little bit of a bump I would say
our<00:02:46.910> bump<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.630> minimal<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.560> elegant<00:02:49.010> and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
our bump is minimal and it's elegant and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.270 
our bump is minimal and it's elegant and
there's<00:02:50.690> sort<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.990> limits<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.560> how<00:02:51.710> much<00:02:51.740> we

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
there's sort of a limits to how much we

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.070 
there's sort of a limits to how much we
would<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.520> willing<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.390> grow<00:02:53.660> over<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
would be willing to to grow over the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.380 
would be willing to to grow over the
rest<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.500> product<00:02:54.860> everything<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.820> driven

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
rest of the product everything is driven

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.240 
rest of the product everything is driven
by<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> same<00:02:56.900> design<00:02:57.410> philosophy<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.130> know

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
by the same design philosophy you know

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.100 
by the same design philosophy you know
we<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.580> global<00:02:58.820> design<00:02:59.270> team<00:02:59.570> we're<00:02:59.989> not

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
we have a global design team we're not

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.460 
we have a global design team we're not
sort<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.410> separated<00:03:00.860> into<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.400> insular

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
sort of separated into this insular

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.320 
sort of separated into this insular
organizations<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.489> everything<00:03:04.970> is

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
organizations and so everything is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.260 
organizations and so everything is
driven<00:03:05.630> by<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:06.230> dedication<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.880> simplicity

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
driven by a dedication to to simplicity

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.140 
driven by a dedication to to simplicity
you<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.930> moving<00:03:09.739> removing<00:03:10.580> elements<00:03:10.730> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
you know moving removing elements it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.120 
you know moving removing elements it
could<00:03:11.270> be<00:03:11.390> between<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.170> Technology<00:03:12.830> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
could be between you and Technology and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.810 
could be between you and Technology and
then<00:03:13.760> also<00:03:14.020> as<00:03:15.020> an<00:03:15.350> honesty<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.280> material

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
then also as an honesty to the material

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.660 
then also as an honesty to the material
and<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.800> dedication<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
and and you know a dedication to the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.570 
and and you know a dedication to the
craft<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.270> think<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:21.020> product<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.130> grip

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
craft so I think a product like grip

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.510 
craft so I think a product like grip
it's<00:03:23.390> not<00:03:23.660> an<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:24.020> metal<00:03:24.290> unibody<00:03:24.590> product<00:03:25.340> it

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
it's not an all metal unibody product it

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.860 
it's not an all metal unibody product it
wouldn't<00:03:25.760> make<00:03:25.820> any<00:03:25.880> sense<00:03:26.239> there<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:26.750> we

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
wouldn't make any sense there so we

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.930 
wouldn't make any sense there so we
really<00:03:27.050> picked<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.560> right<00:03:27.709> kind<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.160> high

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
really picked the right kind of high

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.810 
really picked the right kind of high
quality<00:03:29.080> plastics<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.440> are<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.670> feel

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
quality plastics that are going to feel

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.850 
quality plastics that are going to feel
great<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:33.200> wrist<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.709> then

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
great on you on your wrist and then

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.520 
great on you on your wrist and then
don't<00:03:34.489> compete<00:03:34.880> with<00:03:35.239> your<00:03:35.420> watch<00:03:36.170> if<00:03:36.410> you

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
don't compete with your watch if you
