00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.770 

okay<00:00:12.650> today<00:00:12.980> I'm<00:00:13.100> going<00:00:13.190> to<00:00:13.280> show<00:00:13.460> you<00:00:13.490> how<00:00:13.700> to

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
okay today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.410 
okay today I'm going to show you how to
change<00:00:14.780> a<00:00:14.930> cam<00:00:15.170> sensor<00:00:15.530> on<00:00:15.950> a<00:00:15.980> 7-3<00:00:16.610> diesel

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
change a cam sensor on a 7-3 diesel

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.870 
change a cam sensor on a 7-3 diesel
direct<00:00:17.720> injection<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.490> these<00:00:19.490> had<00:00:19.700> were

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
direct injection and these had were

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.080 
direct injection and these had were
known<00:00:20.150> for<00:00:20.830> failing<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.100> then<00:00:22.760> they<00:00:22.910> would

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
known for failing and then they would

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.019 
known for failing and then they would
lose<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.570> cam<00:00:24.020> sensor<00:00:24.350> signal<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.100> there's

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
lose the cam sensor signal and there's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.089 
lose the cam sensor signal and there's
no<00:00:26.180> crank<00:00:26.510> sensor<00:00:26.750> on<00:00:27.110> these<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:27.500> it<00:00:27.619> lose<00:00:27.830> all

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
no crank sensor on these so it lose all

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.850 
no crank sensor on these so it lose all
base<00:00:28.369> timing<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:29.810> would<00:00:29.900> actually<00:00:30.110> shut

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
base timing and it would actually shut

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.000 
base timing and it would actually shut
down<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.279> engine<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.000> can<00:00:32.150> be<00:00:32.270> going<00:00:32.480> over

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
down the engine so you can be going over

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.650 
down the engine so you can be going over
like<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> bridge<00:00:34.370> that's<00:00:34.640> rough<00:00:34.940> like<00:00:35.180> that<00:00:35.420> and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
like a bridge that's rough like that and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.500 
like a bridge that's rough like that and
would<00:00:36.200> lose<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.770> signal<00:00:37.010> internally<00:00:37.700> by<00:00:38.450> the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
would lose the signal internally by the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.319 
would lose the signal internally by the
actual<00:00:39.140> wires<00:00:39.410> inside<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:40.010> there<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:41.090> the

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
actual wires inside of there that the

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.590 
actual wires inside of there that the
Quayle<00:00:41.780> ups<00:00:41.960> inside<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.410> there<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.600> it'll

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
Quayle ups inside of there and it'll

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.560 
Quayle ups inside of there and it'll
drop<00:00:45.350> out<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.040> then<00:00:46.520> your<00:00:46.700> engine<00:00:47.090> will<00:00:47.240> stall

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
drop out and then your engine will stall

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.990 
drop out and then your engine will stall
I've<00:00:47.870> had<00:00:48.080> it<00:00:48.200> happen<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.500> couple<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.770> times

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
I've had it happen a couple of times

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.810 
I've had it happen a couple of times
before<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.270> recall<00:00:50.420> came<00:00:50.810> out<00:00:51.020> they<00:00:51.920> had<00:00:52.430> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
before the recall came out they had I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.370 
before the recall came out they had I
had<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.970> few<00:00:53.210> customer<00:00:53.630> complaints<00:00:54.200> of

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
had a few customer complaints of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.280 
had a few customer complaints of
intermittent<00:00:54.950> die<00:00:55.160> outs<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.960> start

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
intermittent die outs and you start

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.040 
intermittent die outs and you start
right<00:00:57.440> back<00:00:57.620> up<00:00:57.800> usually<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:59.510> now<00:00:59.750> let's<00:00:59.900> take

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
right back up usually and now let's take

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.420 
right back up usually and now let's take
one<00:01:00.260> home<00:01:00.440> one<00:01:00.620> night<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:00.830> it<00:01:00.980> died<00:01:01.220> out<00:01:01.250> over

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
one home one night and it died out over

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.090 
one home one night and it died out over
the<00:01:01.730> bridge<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.180> shook<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.830> sensor<00:01:03.830> enough

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
the bridge so I shook the sensor enough

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.920 
the bridge so I shook the sensor enough
answer<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.610> was<00:01:04.790> fun<00:01:05.000> on<00:01:05.150> like<00:01:05.299> home<00:01:05.509> so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
answer that was fun on like home so

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.230 
answer that was fun on like home so
it'll<00:01:06.680> have<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.009> happen<00:01:07.430> usually<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.150> know

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
it'll have you happen usually you know

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.820 
it'll have you happen usually you know
over<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.540> bumps<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.110> little<00:01:09.259> sub<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:09.560> start

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
over a bumps and little sub you start

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.359 
over a bumps and little sub you start
break<00:01:10.820> up<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.180> sensor<00:01:11.600> internally<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.070> I'm

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
break up the sensor internally so I'm

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.249 
break up the sensor internally so I'm
actually<00:01:13.520> doing<00:01:13.790> one<00:01:14.270> today<00:01:14.600> that's<00:01:14.869> part<00:01:15.200> of

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
actually doing one today that's part of

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.749 
actually doing one today that's part of
the<00:01:15.380> o7<00:01:16.070> recall<00:01:16.579> on<00:01:16.939> these<00:01:17.719> oh<00:01:18.170> seven<00:01:18.590> s<00:01:18.770> 57<00:01:19.579> and

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
the o7 recall on these oh seven s 57 and

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.669 
the o7 recall on these oh seven s 57 and
I'm<00:01:20.329> just<00:01:20.450> going<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.749> give<00:01:20.899> you<00:01:20.990> my<00:01:21.140> basic

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
I'm just going to give you my basic

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.789 
I'm just going to give you my basic
demonstration<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.969> it<00:01:23.749> so<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.289> pull<00:01:24.679> them

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
demonstration of it so you can pull them

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.529 
demonstration of it so you can pull them
out<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:24.950> know<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.249> lot<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.549> 7-3<00:01:26.090> owners<00:01:26.359> know

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
out I know a lot of 7-3 owners know

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.910 
out I know a lot of 7-3 owners know
about<00:01:26.719> this<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.289> they<00:01:27.350> actually<00:01:27.380> keep<00:01:27.679> one<00:01:27.890> in

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
about this and they actually keep one in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.249 
about this and they actually keep one in
the<00:01:28.009> glove<00:01:28.069> box<00:01:28.539> back<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.569> a<00:01:29.719> day<00:01:29.929> when<00:01:30.140> they

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
the glove box back in a day when they

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.590 
the glove box back in a day when they
had<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.469> gray<00:01:30.799> scent<00:01:31.219> or<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.399> black<00:01:32.090> sensor

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
had the gray scent or the black sensor

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.069 
had the gray scent or the black sensor
now<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.439> new<00:01:34.009> ones<00:01:34.249> are<00:01:34.609> an<00:01:35.210> actual<00:01:35.420> part<00:01:36.020> of

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
now the new ones are an actual part of

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.639 
now the new ones are an actual part of
the<00:01:36.140> recall<00:01:36.499> our<00:01:36.770> gray<00:01:37.189> sensor<00:01:37.749> and<00:01:38.749> these

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
the recall our gray sensor and these

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.309 
the recall our gray sensor and these
ones<00:01:39.859> are<00:01:40.009> extremely<00:01:40.639> cheap<00:01:40.939> but<00:01:41.929> I<00:01:41.960> guess

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
ones are extremely cheap but I guess

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.419 
ones are extremely cheap but I guess
they're<00:01:42.530> working<00:01:42.859> because<00:01:42.920> we<00:01:43.069> haven't<00:01:43.219> had

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
they're working because we haven't had

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.590 
they're working because we haven't had
any<00:01:43.639> come<00:01:43.850> back<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.329> two<00:01:45.939> said<00:01:46.939> they're<00:01:47.149> still

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
any come back in two said they're still

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.859 
any come back in two said they're still
failing<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.259> cutting<00:01:48.590> out<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.210> these<00:01:50.210> do<00:01:50.630> work

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
failing and cutting out so these do work

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.800 
failing and cutting out so these do work
I<00:01:51.170> guess<00:01:51.560> for<00:01:51.889> just<00:01:52.069> one<00:01:52.249> in<00:01:52.369> bulk<00:01:52.670> because<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
I guess for just one in bulk because the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.120 
I guess for just one in bulk because the
old<00:01:53.960> ones<00:01:54.109> were<00:01:54.200> around<00:01:54.409> eighty<00:01:54.679> ninety

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
old ones were around eighty ninety

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.440 
old ones were around eighty ninety
dollars<00:01:55.459> I<00:01:55.520> think<00:01:55.700> these<00:01:55.880> ones<00:01:56.119> were<00:01:56.270> like

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
dollars I think these ones were like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.099 
dollars I think these ones were like
20-some<00:01:57.049> dollars<00:01:57.469> retail<00:01:58.459> so<00:01:58.999> we're<00:01:59.929> going<00:02:00.049> to

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
20-some dollars retail so we're going to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.569 
20-some dollars retail so we're going to
go<00:02:00.200> through<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.009> first<00:02:01.249> time<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.459> got

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
go through it and the first time you got

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.529 
go through it and the first time you got
to<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:01.819> is<00:02:03.189> pull<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.219> pig<00:02:04.459> tail<00:02:04.670> off<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.359> you

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
to do is pull the pig tail off and you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.239 
to do is pull the pig tail off and you
just<00:02:05.569> pull<00:02:05.869> back<00:02:06.079> on<00:02:06.259> like<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.889> it'll

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
just pull back on like this and it'll

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.540 
just pull back on like this and it'll
pull<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.459> whole<00:02:07.700> pig<00:02:07.939> tail<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:10.160> after

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
pull the whole pig tail and then after

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.059 
pull the whole pig tail and then after
that<00:02:10.789> there's<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.150> 10<00:02:11.690> millimeter<00:02:12.140> bolt<00:02:12.530> where

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
that there's a 10 millimeter bolt where

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.760 
that there's a 10 millimeter bolt where
bolts<00:02:13.459> into<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> front<00:02:14.030> cover<00:02:14.440> let's<00:02:15.440> see

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
bolts into the front cover let's see

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.550 
bolts into the front cover let's see
well<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.100> found<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.580> deep<00:02:17.420> well<00:02:17.690> 10<00:02:18.080> millimeter

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
well I found a deep well 10 millimeter

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.430 
well I found a deep well 10 millimeter
and<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.819> three<00:02:20.269> inch<00:02:20.450> extension

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
and a three inch extension

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.000 
and a three inch extension
creates<00:02:22.190> ratchet<00:02:22.820> works<00:02:23.090> perfect<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.830> can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
creates ratchet works perfect you can

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040 
creates ratchet works perfect you can
start<00:02:25.250> getting<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.610> bolt<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.990> know

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
start getting that bolt out and you know

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.660 
start getting that bolt out and you know
if<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.440> season<00:02:27.980> they're<00:02:28.160> pretty<00:02:28.400> good

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
if it is season they're pretty good

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.790 
if it is season they're pretty good
shooting<00:02:29.150> they<00:02:29.330> aren't<00:02:29.690> you'd<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.470> enough

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
shooting they aren't you'd have enough

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.860 
shooting they aren't you'd have enough
leverage<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.880> break<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> bolt<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.660> there

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
leverage here to break the bolt on there

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.320 
leverage here to break the bolt on there
and<00:02:33.100> break<00:02:34.100> torque<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.060> out<00:02:36.100> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and break torque on and get it out and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.750 
and break torque on and get it out and
then<00:02:38.330> what<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.110> use<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:40.580> long

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
then what I do is I use a really long

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.070 
then what I do is I use a really long
flat<00:02:41.390> blade<00:02:41.600> screwdriver<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:43.600> pry<00:02:44.600> bar<00:02:44.630> like

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
flat blade screwdriver or a pry bar like

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.440 
flat blade screwdriver or a pry bar like
this<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.770> some<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.190> angle<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
this you get some kind of angle and you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.470 
this you get some kind of angle and you
can<00:02:47.510> start<00:02:47.810> working<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.290> out<00:02:48.380> side<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.860> side

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
can start working it out side to side

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.520 
can start working it out side to side
you<00:02:50.480> don't<00:02:50.660> want<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:50.990> do<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:51.440> in

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you don't want to just do it right in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
you don't want to just do it right in
the<00:02:51.560> middle<00:02:51.770> you'll<00:02:52.010> break<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.940> sensor<00:02:53.420> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the middle you'll break the sensor and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.520 
the middle you'll break the sensor and
that's<00:02:54.830> why<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.040> bust<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:55.910> my<00:02:56.230> flat<00:02:57.230> blade

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that's why I bust out my flat blade

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.970 
that's why I bust out my flat blade
screwdriver<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.630> you<00:03:00.290> can<00:03:00.440> start<00:03:00.620> working<00:03:00.890> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
screwdriver and you can start working it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.000 
screwdriver and you can start working it
side<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.250> side<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:03.110> getting<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.530> out<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.710> there

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
side to side and getting it out of there

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.320 
side to side and getting it out of there
so<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:06.590> one<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.010> original<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:08.000> got<00:03:08.210> over

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
so this one is original it's got over

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.380 
so this one is original it's got over
two<00:03:08.690> hours<00:03:08.840> from<00:03:09.020> thousand<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.740> it<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:11.240> a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
two hours from thousand on it and it's a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.520 
two hours from thousand on it and it's a
little<00:03:11.630> hard<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.990> get<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.260> out<00:03:12.380> especially

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
little hard to get it out especially

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.190 
little hard to get it out especially
one-handed<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:14.420> looks<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:14.870> pretty

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
one-handed but looks like it's pretty

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.800 
one-handed but looks like it's pretty
close<00:03:15.740> right<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.270> should<00:03:17.510> be<00:03:17.600> able<00:03:17.690> to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
close right now and I should be able to

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.470 
close right now and I should be able to
wiggle<00:03:18.470> out<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.800> there<00:03:19.160> by<00:03:20.000> hand

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680 

there<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.570> comes<00:03:24.700> once<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.820> get<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.090> old<00:03:26.240> sensor

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
there it comes once I get the old sensor

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.900 
there it comes once I get the old sensor
out<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.990> clean<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> bore<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.580> actual

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
new one let me go start popping it back

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.000 
new one let me go start popping it back
in<00:03:41.440> okay<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:42.620> going<00:03:42.800> back<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.310> just<00:03:44.860> push<00:03:45.860> it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
in okay then going back in just push it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
right back into there and I'll sit flush

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.170 
right back into there and I'll sit flush
and<00:03:48.200> there's<00:03:48.830> no<00:03:48.980> alignment<00:03:49.730> or<00:03:49.850> not<00:03:50.000> like

and there's no alignment or not like

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.690 
and there's no alignment or not like
that<00:03:50.480> make<00:03:50.780> sure<00:03:50.959> your<00:03:51.080> bolt<00:03:51.380> lines<00:03:52.130> up<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
that make sure your bolt lines up and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.690 
that make sure your bolt lines up and
you<00:03:52.820> thread<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.390> by<00:03:53.600> hand<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.260> then<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.430> put

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
you thread it in by hand and then I put

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.280 
you thread it in by hand and then I put
a<00:03:55.730> bit<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:56.000> dielectric<00:03:56.540> grease<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.020> pins

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
a bit of dielectric grease and the pins

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.340 
a bit of dielectric grease and the pins
here<00:03:57.800> so<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:59.060> protect<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.750> pins

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
here so that we can protect the pins

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.230 
here so that we can protect the pins
from<00:04:00.530> corrosion<00:04:00.980> since<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.760> down<00:04:01.970> here<00:04:02.000> in

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
from corrosion since it is down here in

from corrosion since it is down here in
the<00:04:02.300> elements<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.930> they<00:04:03.530> need<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.770> snap<00:04:04.070> your

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
the elements and they need to snap your

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.230 
the elements and they need to snap your
connector<00:04:04.700> back<00:04:04.910> in

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.900 

until<00:04:12.240> it<00:04:12.330> clicks<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.160> go<00:04:14.310> ahead<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.640> dry

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
until it clicks you can go ahead and dry

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.610 
until it clicks you can go ahead and dry
it<00:04:14.970> out<00:04:15.150> okay<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:15.840> after<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.230> you've<00:04:16.380> gotta

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
it out okay so after that you've gotta

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.110 
it out okay so after that you've gotta
start<00:04:16.919> out<00:04:17.040> let<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.310> run<00:04:17.459> for<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.730> little<00:04:17.850> bit

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
start out let it run for a little bit

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.990 
start out let it run for a little bit
and<00:04:18.389> you'll<00:04:18.630> know<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.799> got<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> camp<00:04:20.459> signal<00:04:20.910> or

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and you'll know you got a camp signal or

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.730 
and you'll know you got a camp signal or
not<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.419> everything's<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.780> fine<00:04:22.169> no<00:04:22.440> codes

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
not and everything's just fine no codes

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.950 
not and everything's just fine no codes
and<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.130> that

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.629 

make<00:04:29.530> sure<00:04:29.710> idle<00:04:30.130> smooth<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.639> all<00:04:30.729> that

as<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:35.020> did<00:04:35.169> before<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.159> cam<00:04:36.400> sensor

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669

as it did before the cam sensor
replacement<00:04:37.110> we<00:04:38.110> had<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.259> few<00:04:38.530> instances<00:04:39.159> where

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
replacement we had a few instances where

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.350 
replacement we had a few instances where

for a number aids and a few of them had
a<00:04:46.419> rough<00:04:46.900> idle<00:04:47.439> issues<00:04:48.009> afterwards<00:04:48.870> down<00:04:49.870> the

a rough idle issues afterwards down the

it's<00:04:52.240> something<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:52.659> look<00:04:52.750> out<00:04:52.960> for<00:04:53.259> if<00:04:53.889> you

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
it's something to look out for if you

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.020 
it's something to look out for if you
are<00:04:54.189> changing<00:04:54.789> over<00:04:54.909> to<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.180> gray<00:04:55.389> sensor
