00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this is a piece of wood that the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
this is a piece of wood that the
components<00:01:05.190> that<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.400> sent<00:01:05.610> me<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> that

components that are sent me this is that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.350 
components that are sent me this is that
piece<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:06.720> where<00:01:07.110> Baron<00:01:07.619> goes

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
piece right there where Baron goes

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
piece right there where Baron goes
pretty<00:01:09.360> rotted<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.950> supposedly<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> barn<00:01:11.460> fell

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
pretty rotted out supposedly a barn fell

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
pretty rotted out supposedly a barn fell
on<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.689> been<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.470> left<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
on it and that's been kind of left in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.080 
on it and that's been kind of left in
decay<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.510> last<00:01:15.720> 10<00:01:16.049> years<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:20.090> piece

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
decay for the last 10 years or so piece

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.779 
decay for the last 10 years or so piece
of<00:01:21.240> wood<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.530> uh<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
of wood right here it's uh one of the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.679 
of wood right here it's uh one of the
side<00:01:24.000> pieces<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:25.020> bbc's<00:01:25.469> pretty<00:01:25.799> rotted<00:01:26.189> out

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
side pieces the bbc's pretty rotted out

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.529 
side pieces the bbc's pretty rotted out
so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.719> didn't<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.109> whole<00:01:28.289> lot<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.770> with

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
so I didn't have a whole lot to go with

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.149 
so I didn't have a whole lot to go with
to<00:01:30.539> do<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> restoration<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.530> did<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.920> enough

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to do the restoration I did have enough

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.950 
to do the restoration I did have enough
to<00:01:32.250> work<00:01:32.429> with<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> uh<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.130> unit<00:01:35.520> does

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
to work with but uh what this unit does

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.399 
to work with but uh what this unit does
is<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.469> take<00:01:37.649> it<00:01:38.450> call<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> corn<00:01:39.899> like<00:01:40.109> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is you take it call the corn like this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.700 
is you take it call the corn like this
and<00:01:41.600> once<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.960> thing<00:01:43.140> cranked<00:01:43.530> up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and once you get this thing cranked up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450 
and once you get this thing cranked up
it<00:01:44.009> takes<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.460> kernels<00:01:45.030> off<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.179> corn<00:01:46.219> ice<00:01:47.219> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it takes all kernels off the corn ice is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.239 
it takes all kernels off the corn ice is
pretty<00:01:47.670> neat<00:01:47.939> unit<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.569> can<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.859> two<00:01:49.859> cards

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
pretty neat unit so you can do two cards

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.959 
pretty neat unit so you can do two cards
at<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> same<00:01:50.490> time<00:01:52.219> all<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.280> mechanics

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
at the same time all the mechanics

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.200 
at the same time all the mechanics
pretty<00:01:54.450> good<00:01:55.130> had<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> couple<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.670> issues<00:01:56.759> they

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
pretty good had a couple of issues they

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
pretty good had a couple of issues they
can<00:01:57.270> replace<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> handle<00:01:58.429> because<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.520> had<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
can replace the handle because I had to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
can replace the handle because I had to
do<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> complete<00:02:00.329> paint<00:02:00.600> job<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.469> made

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
do a complete paint job on it's all made

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.910 
do a complete paint job on it's all made
of<00:02:01.890> white<00:02:02.130> oak<00:02:03.109> even<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.170> sides<00:02:04.409> made<00:02:04.799> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of white oak even the sides made of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.180 
of white oak even the sides made of
white<00:02:05.100> oak<00:02:05.130> top<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.329> made<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.600> white<00:02:06.810> out

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.160 

is<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> original<00:02:11.090> top<00:02:11.300> looked<00:02:11.600> like<00:02:11.840> a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
is what the original top looked like a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.460 
is what the original top looked like a
whole<00:02:12.860> lot<00:02:13.070> left<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.730> took<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.780> lot<00:02:14.960> of<00:02:14.990> figurin

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
whole lot left I took a lot of figurin

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.380 
whole lot left I took a lot of figurin
to<00:02:15.500> get<00:02:15.740> exactly<00:02:16.160> right<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> tolerances

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to get exactly right and the tolerances

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.990 
to get exactly right and the tolerances
on<00:02:17.600> these<00:02:17.780> things<00:02:18.050> are<00:02:18.200> real<00:02:18.470> close<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.820> about

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
on these things are real close to about

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.110 
on these things are real close to about
a<00:02:20.030> sixteenth<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.810> an<00:02:20.930> inch<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.580> takes<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.940> lot

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
a sixteenth of an inch so it takes a lot

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.970 
a sixteenth of an inch so it takes a lot
of<00:02:23.180> precision<00:02:23.480> work<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.500> come<00:02:24.710> up<00:02:24.860> with

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
of precision work to come up with

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.720 
of precision work to come up with
something<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:30.340> basically<00:02:31.340> from

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
something like this basically from

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.199 
something like this basically from
pictures<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.709> had<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.830> make<00:02:34.010> new<00:02:34.040> stencils<00:02:34.790> on

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209
