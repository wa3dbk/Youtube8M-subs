00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.029
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.910
 hook tv and today we talk about such 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.609
 car as pz h2000 will not complicate 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.939
 This name will be pronounced as in 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.339
 the game 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.759
 well, or just 2000 las so 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.440
 even simpler than the landscape name itself 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.059
 generally call it short 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.680
 I like this coffin at all 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.960
 tracks I can name because 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.360
 the dimensions are appropriate and let's 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.629
 I will tell you what kind of car this well 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.829
 Firstly, this artillery is the eighth level 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.390
 paladin's rival who 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.239
 By the way, you see such a country 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.190
 wonderful jumping t-90 which is like 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.750
 pop singer on the stage like dima bilan 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.760
 some kind of lights 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.710
 but in fact he was so ignited that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.629
 I give him three shots in lobeshnik 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.820
 and sent by the way the video was a little bit 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.010
 accelerated it think no car so 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.530
 drives fast and doesn't recharge on so 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.810
 fast recharge incidentally order 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.030
 twenty four seconds we have a cassette 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.360
 of the three shells so it is logical that this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.740
 15 no 10 seconds recharge between 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.570
 shells more precisely between shots in 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.820
 the cassette goes 3 seconds to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.009
 it takes about the same amount 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.020
 time that is not like on mary you 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.790
 bummed you already recharged 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.619
 projectile and you have not yet reduced there 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.590
 it has been around for about the same time 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.750
 how much and recharges inside 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.369
 cassette shells and these three shells you 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.350
 you can go straight one by one somewhere 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.329
 start up which is undoubtedly great 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.939
 plus but let's understand better 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.130
 this car is paladin or not of course 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.560
 there is one big minus her wild in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.990
 first this is her huge size this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.149
 Sarah is still just incredible sizes and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.060
 while it is not very fast and therefore 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.460
 from the outline of the battery light get away pretty 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 problematic this is not my favor 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.719
 our drum if paladin is ok 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.270
 starts to glow on the battery circuit 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.700
 firing with only 3 shots ie 1 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.740
 marked on the map. somewhere near 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.690
 then in the second a square is marked and 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.150
 only then it is marked on the map where 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.880
 he is worth it then we actually for 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.980
 one drum 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.410
 it all happens in one drum per 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.230
 9 seconds we shine like a Christmas tree 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 and already the enemy surely knows where we are 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 we stand so we will focus 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.790
 get used and get used to ride it 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.920
 save your life movement equals life 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.990
 by the way yes if you pump this car to 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 Sorry again, she stock me and 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
 if you bleed it even there 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.460
 the engine will be normal in horses and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.050
 there is already a car will be much faster there 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.910
 you can already be dodging 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.800
 enemy fire in the current do it but 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.450
 a little hard i wouldn't say that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.120
 over all impossible task 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.860
 but absolutely not easy by the way 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.740
 the fight was quite long 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.930
 so I cut it in short fights 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.450
 you can't shoot much 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.240
 explain one-time damage to the ward at 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.160
 bt hit about 500 units well 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.100
 we take the average value takes off from 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.960
 400 to about 500 on average and if you 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.750
 shoot at non armored targets there 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.270
 under 800 it is rarely shorter than 400 500 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.850
 per shot while reloading 15 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.500
 seconds a little but relatively speaking 17 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.250
 seconds you came back all over 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.100
 recharged 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.870
 and shot that is in a minute we have dpm 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.370
 but about two thousand units 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.900
 here dpm per minute God forbid 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.990
 1700 is if we are all three shells 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.180
 we get and we get directly in direct 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.780
 we hit about three hundred 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.910
 units it is at best 300 330 it 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.670
 the most maximum that I probably saw 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.340
 Well, so flies when hit next 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.950
 or not very well 180 200 with something 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.500
 in short with a drum with full we 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.350
 we take out less than a thousand that is 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.420
 dpm we get much less and 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.670
 one-time damage is also less than any advantages 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.830
 in this plan in firepower in front of the ward 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.750
 us, we did not get to 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.640
 the only thing we do of course already 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.590
 more convenient is to shoot for some and 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.540
 easy goals that stand but where are you 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.520
 have seen an idiot on bpm who will 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.250
 stand when three shells are flying on it 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.500
 out of the pack yes here to be honest I would never 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.510
 I have not met this and have not met for everything 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.799
 battles that are played on her as well as 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.810
 The artillery me in this game is very 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.880
 I like it a lot 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.190
 shells fly thank God even 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.610
 quite bright and their trajectories are more 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.289
 less flight adequate 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.120
 that compared to a paladin of course 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.310
 undoubted plus yes and information all the same 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.469
 better but honestly one-time damage 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.199
 paladin himself spits in those pluses 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:37.569
 here this car as it has and 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.460
 its flaws like huge sizes and 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.500
 mobility is not good 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.629
 plus this again is not particularly high 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.729
 one-time damage is that it just glows 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.120
 like some i don't know just mode in 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.889
 field 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.900
 but I mean the battery circuit 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.180
 shooting and just like that it glows 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.310
 wonderful short minuses here 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.530
 enough but from the pros dubious 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.870
 drum which is up with full implementation 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.849
 of course gives us good damage but in 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.370
 the average for the damage is much 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.520
 less than the paladin machine certainly 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.680
 nice yes but no serious damage 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.020
 you can hardly fill it with mine 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.779
 a record on this machine is 5,600 while 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.479
 it's really a lot it's just great 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:20.139
 battle on the landscape is usually a good battle on 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.599
 the landscape is four thousand 4,000 damage it 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.479
 very such a good fight where you really 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.969
 many shot attacks on average two three 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.860
 thousands it's quite a bit for the eighth 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.690
 level that is, those compared to the same 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.199
 paladin who from fight to fight can 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.080
 take out 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.210
 but calmly so not straining slaughter 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.729
 about 4,000 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.430
 well, at best, 78 I saw 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.289
 results and 10,000 is in general not 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.810
 rival paladin is obtained in such 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.120
 case and now you have to think a 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.699
 what for I need such a scab if there is 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.129
 paladin agree to paladin in some 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.539
 damage plan is better but here 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.210
 some sort of peculiar too 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.750
 the gameplay and the machine is not annoying 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.180
 brain 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.360
 yes this is all the same art to which it is necessary 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.310
 think as if you know some 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.469
 The game on arte is associated with some kind of 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.389
 pleasure eats and relaxed money 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.279
 shoots without thinking don't fall and 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.710
 some damage there cause them from this 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.900
 Of course good in general with you was 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.819
 credit and draw conclusions and see 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.819
 who else will poner all bye bye
