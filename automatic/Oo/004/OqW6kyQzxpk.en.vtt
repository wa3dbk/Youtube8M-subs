couple of the little white knobs here on

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.630 
couple of the little white knobs here on
these<00:00:13.679> sliders<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.630> your<00:00:15.780> general

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
these sliders and then just your general

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.660 
these sliders and then just your general
paint<00:00:17.640> chips<00:00:18.119> missing<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.930> whatnot<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
paint chips missing and whatnot this is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.400 
paint chips missing and whatnot this is
powered<00:00:21.210> by<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:22.320> 9<00:00:23.130> volt<00:00:23.160> DC<00:00:23.609> power<00:00:23.820> brick<00:00:24.420> I've

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
powered by a 9 volt DC power brick I've

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.230 
powered by a 9 volt DC power brick I've
never<00:00:25.619> used<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.980> battery<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.820> think<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
never used a battery and I think a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.740 
never used a battery and I think a
battery<00:00:27.599> would<00:00:27.720> probably<00:00:28.580> probably<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:30.000> get

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
battery would probably probably just get

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
battery would probably probably just get
eaten<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.320> fast<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:31.980> pedal<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
eaten up really fast in this pedal so I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.510 
eaten up really fast in this pedal so I
do<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.059> recommend<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.309> I've<00:00:35.309> never

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
do not recommend that and I've never

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
do not recommend that and I've never
used<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
used one so I don't even know if it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.959 
used one so I don't even know if it
works<00:00:37.980> by<00:00:38.700> about<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> battery<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> get

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
works by about a battery so if you get

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.049 
works by about a battery so if you get
this<00:00:42.030> pedal<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> power<00:00:43.950> brick<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.430> some

will<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> volume<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.150> know

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
will turn the volume up here so we know

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
will turn the volume up here so we know
that<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:14.780> that's<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.700> set<00:01:17.700> flat<00:01:18.030> right

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that it's on so that's on set flat right

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.100 
that it's on so that's on set flat right
now<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> pretty<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.689> turning

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
now so pretty much that's just turning

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
now so pretty much that's just turning
here<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
here when you just do that that just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.280 
here when you just do that that just
turns<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.479> amp<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.049> let<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.110> just

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
show you the that each frequency here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
show you the that each frequency here
actually<00:01:32.640> does<00:01:33.000> something<00:01:33.240> let's<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.079> start

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
actually does something let's just start

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
actually does something let's just start

on low and work our way across to the
higher<00:01:35.729> frequencies<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:38.270> bass<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.570> their

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
higher frequencies that bass in their

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.100 
higher frequencies that bass in their
bull<00:01:41.070> now

blow me in action the mid-range 6.4 k up

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.060 
blow me in action the mid-range 6.4 k up
top<00:02:10.970> there<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.100> let's<00:02:13.310> set<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.550> up<00:02:17.740> okay<00:02:18.740> so

sounds<00:03:05.739> pretty<00:03:05.799> daggone<00:03:06.310> good<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:10.750> really

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
sounds pretty daggone good it really

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.620 
sounds pretty daggone good it really
obviously<00:03:11.769> adds<00:03:11.950> mids<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.760> uh<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.209> breaks<00:03:13.450> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
obviously adds mids but uh it breaks it
