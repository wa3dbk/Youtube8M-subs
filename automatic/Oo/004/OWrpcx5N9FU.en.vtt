00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.180
 for us 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:09.410
 there is an opinion to that more 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.219
 says there when it was that God took away the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:19.320
 prison says when he or she is a job when 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:22.350
 he all worked for his friends 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.020
 hear this well 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 so that he calls us goodbye to 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.060
 administer also 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.980
 of thanks you received from God 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.100
 unhappy if you are your miracle of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.739
 God supplies a miracle to someone 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.649
 now for someone if you were healed 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.839
 I enter the material hate spite and everything 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.460
 that you know you were bringing you can donate 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.380
 for someone that this person has 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.040
 released from that 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.500
 until just not by his friends he was 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.350
 removed that affliction 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.700
 in other words when it was outside 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.810
 the prison the least there is to be 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.420
 fact was to be lamenting 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.790
 I had to have declared words of faith 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.600
 4 say amen sisters of this one I get up 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.580
 Amen 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.960
 but I came for seven days and seven nights 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.000
 contemplate someone die brothers 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 psychologically emotionally that's 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 terrible 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 I had to visit the evil or sick 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.659
 in the sixth floor of social insurance is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.540
 terrible to see someone die and not be able to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.310
 do nothing 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 but what better to give a word of God 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.510
 a word once he speaks for a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.130
 person 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:46.390
 a friend of mine lord of 55 years 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.300
 was my employee my worker 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.980
 and always double god but I did not want 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.220
 nothing roberts 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.650
 on the contrary he made fun of singing 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.810
 song that made me annoyed me 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.560
 little but at the same time is that someday it will 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.329
 get something out of God 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.890
 because they knew that he was already a pastor in that 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.250
 I said time was the shepherd with his 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.200
 sheep 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.979
 I do not know where they got this case but I 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.319
 sang 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.940
 and an occasion so that some day you 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.230
 you will believe that you preach of Christ and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.720
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to talk about 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.150
 sir time passes brother and this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.670
 man 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.500
 He began to lose weight and lose weight and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.829
 lose weight and lose weight I said that this 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.210
 step man is sick he did not want me 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.090
 tell 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.470
 out on the sixth floor brothers beds 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.470
 600 days I do not remember 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.820
 and I will visit 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:45.600
 and I remember that as your boss told you 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.880
 Listen to him calmly and do not 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.180
 worry about work today you get back on 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.090
 Hey 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 After that you can do your job and now 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.060
 I'm going to withdraw the command that suddenly 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.710
 he stops me he says 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.230
 I ask you a favor 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.230
 tell me now for me 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.240
 you want to accept Christ as your 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.760
 savior 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.959
 he says yes 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.959
 I'm afraid of dying 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.800
 and apart from that which is next to the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.240
 half said the one next to pray 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.250
 death 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.250
 in the night and my hair is gone 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.069
 and he received jesus brother 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.250
 I would be one more opportunity was 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.959

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.720
 our lives to be more the truth and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.640
 Remove from the mask 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.890
 raise your diaz hand I've been 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.620
 tremendous still as Christians how many have 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.549
 been 3 - even as Christians 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.549
 the goal 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.480
 sometimes we come here brother look 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.480
 we are like wrestling 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.960
 and when in my time I went to the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.530
 wrestling there was one that was called a thousand 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.530
 More expensive 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.620
 here there is no debt 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.620
 there is another that was called darkness 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.430
 another is the saint 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.620
 we are all said that we are all saints 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.190
 Give what it says glory to God brothers 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.280
 and taking advantage of their 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.250
 but tremendous now 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.020
 this man received Christ knows that 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.690
 did when we were going to the events of 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.150
 anniversary of the company he carried 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.980
 his wife although my pastor or by 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.310
 we as marriages I remembered 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.500
 that 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.460
 he was taking his old wife because 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.770
 I was an adult of 56 57 almost 60 I had 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.900
 this man the lady of adult also 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.660
 and took her to the events 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.639
 and that word with your brother camera and yes 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.310
 I saw some nice girl who 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.050
 I took pictures 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.849
 and the wife there 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.710
 things determines that as they say 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.710
 swallow everything I did 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.940
 It was tremendous 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.840
 but he folded his hands in front of God 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.580
 because God shore us to know Him God 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.940
 it takes you to deliver what you can not 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.250
 surrendering God leads you to change what 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.510
 you can not change when they say amen 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.830
 the more 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.930
 and it is what God did with you 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.540
 young man was used to being in the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.500
 presence of god was used to 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:47.410
 walk with god but when I had proof 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.400
 Brother forgot and started complaining 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.639
 bad said the day he was born 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.370
 but in the end the manuel did the right thing 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.900
 he prayed for his friends and the 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.300
 anguish 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.990
 what is the secret for that anguish 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.610
 what does he bring? 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.390
 now for 'the minister someone calls out 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.070
 God for someone or not for someone how much 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.990
 says glory to God the most 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.420
 because sometimes we are focused on 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.180
 we ourselves are saying to and from 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.890
 me there is going to be my brothers to 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.830
 Sometimes we centralize ourselves of not being 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.160
 egocentric thought nothing more than 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.529
 us and not our neighbor 4 says about 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.109
 goodbye 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:35.289
 but when you start thinking about the 

00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:37.449
 people who need god who needs 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.729
 a miracle from God you start 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.070
 to look at the command the need of your 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.630
 brother 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.040

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.920

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.500
 if you are sick and pass it to you 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.060
 no crying no stronger disease 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.460
 is the way for God to remove your 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.850
 affliction now for another who is 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.770
 sick and God will remove your affliction in 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.600
