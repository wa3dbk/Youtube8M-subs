see<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.270> I<00:00:20.359> targeted<00:00:20.900> them<00:00:21.080> using<00:00:21.500> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
see that I targeted them using the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.070 
see that I targeted them using the
moustache<00:00:22.070> attack<00:00:22.520> that's<00:00:23.180> just<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.510> recap<00:00:23.870> a

moustache attack that's just to recap a
strategy<00:00:24.860> of<00:00:24.890> attack<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.400> we<00:00:25.820> covered<00:00:26.330> in

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
strategy of attack that we covered in

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.330 
strategy of attack that we covered in
the<00:00:26.600> last<00:00:26.810> video<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.530> we're<00:00:27.950> going<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.100> do

the last video and we're going to do
another<00:00:28.820> attack<00:00:29.390> strategy<00:00:29.900> in<00:00:29.990> this<00:00:30.140> video

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
stash and then we'll also farm off

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.280 
stash and then we'll also farm off
enough<00:00:39.920> resources<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:41.120> pop<00:00:41.930> down<00:00:42.230> a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
enough resources to pop down a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.010 
enough resources to pop down a
laboratory<00:00:43.280> that's<00:00:43.970> extremely<00:00:44.540> important<00:00:44.960> to

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
laboratory that's extremely important to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.900 
laboratory that's extremely important to
get<00:00:45.170> down<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:45.980> we<00:00:46.190> can<00:00:46.399> research

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
get down so that we can research

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.810 
get down so that we can research
barbarians<00:00:47.600> up<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.899> level<00:00:48.260> two<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:49.520> is

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
barbarians up to level two that is

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.750 
barbarians up to level two that is
what's<00:00:50.059> in<00:00:50.270> our<00:00:50.390> future<00:00:50.660> however<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.829> farm<00:00:52.370> up

what's in our future however to farm up

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.580 
what's in our future however to farm up
that<00:00:53.620> laboratory<00:00:54.620> we<00:00:55.010> need<00:00:55.750> 25,000<00:00:56.750> elixir<00:00:57.379> as

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
that laboratory we need 25,000 elixir as

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.619 
that laboratory we need 25,000 elixir as
you<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.370> our<00:00:58.399> vaults<00:00:59.000> right<00:00:59.059> now<00:00:59.329> only

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you can see our vaults right now only

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.600 
you can see our vaults right now only
have<00:01:00.020> 80<00:01:00.940> 500<00:01:01.940> max<00:01:02.239> capacity<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:03.590> clearly<00:01:04.250> that

have 80 500 max capacity so clearly that
is<00:01:05.059> my<00:01:05.210> highest<00:01:05.449> priority<00:01:06.229> building<00:01:06.619> at<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
is my highest priority building at the

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.609 
is my highest priority building at the
moment<00:01:07.219> I<00:01:07.399> want<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.939> uncap<00:01:08.539> that<00:01:08.869> sucker<00:01:09.289> I

its<00:01:12.470> capacity<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:13.549> vault<00:01:13.850> right

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
its capacity on that one vault right

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.380 
its capacity on that one vault right
there<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:14.869> takes<00:01:15.110> us<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> max<00:01:15.680> capacity<00:01:15.860> of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
there that takes us to a max capacity of

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.940 
there that takes us to a max capacity of
10,000<00:01:17.390> getting<00:01:18.020> there<00:01:18.140> guys<00:01:18.380> we're<00:01:18.619> getting

mustache what's the dirty mustache well
that's<00:01:57.829> where<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.070> basically<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.640> about

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
that's where you basically have about

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.249 
that's where you basically have about
two<00:01:59.150> thirds<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.540> your<00:01:59.659> troops<00:01:59.900> or<00:02:00.110> your

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
two thirds of your troops or your

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.899 
two thirds of your troops or your
mustache<00:02:00.590> man<00:02:00.829> those<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:01.130> your<00:02:01.250> barbarians

mustache man those are your barbarians

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.940 
mustache man those are your barbarians
and<00:02:02.180> then<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.720> course<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.170> dirty<00:02:03.439> part<00:02:03.740> comes

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and then of course the dirty part comes

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.830 
and then of course the dirty part comes
in<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> old<00:02:04.520> goblins<00:02:05.270> now<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.570> don't

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
in with the old goblins now I don't

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.300 
in with the old goblins now I don't
really<00:02:05.960> like<00:02:06.079> goblins<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.920> don't<00:02:07.280> like

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
really like goblins I don't like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.949 
really like goblins I don't like
dropping<00:02:07.670> goblins<00:02:08.239> when<00:02:08.360> there's<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.569> mortar

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
dropping goblins when there's a mortar

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.539 
dropping goblins when there's a mortar
around<00:02:09.049> because<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.739> mortar<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.189> take<00:02:10.399> them

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
around because the mortar can take them

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.280 
around because the mortar can take them
out<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:10.879> an<00:02:11.030> area<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.390> effect<00:02:11.629> splash<00:02:12.049> damage

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
out it's an area of effect splash damage

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.830 
out it's an area of effect splash damage
type<00:02:12.650> deal<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.819> that's<00:02:14.389> going<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.689> take

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
type deal and so that's going to take

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.839 
type deal and so that's going to take
out<00:02:15.019> your<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.829> dirty<00:02:16.040> part<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.579> dirty

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
out your the dirty part here dirty

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.090 
out your the dirty part here dirty
mustache<00:02:17.139> so

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
mustache so

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800 
mustache so
it's<00:02:19.430> probably<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.030> best<00:02:20.060> strategy<00:02:20.390> at<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
it's probably the best strategy at the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's probably the best strategy at the
moment<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.710> just<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.400> raid<00:02:22.580> player

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
moment is just to just a raid player

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.300 
moment is just to just a raid player
versus<00:02:23.780> player<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.500> barbarians<00:02:25.220> a
