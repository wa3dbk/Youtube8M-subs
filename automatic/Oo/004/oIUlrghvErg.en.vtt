00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.140
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 a new video of young 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 Today I want to show you this look 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 the me eyes on the transformer of the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 It totally reminds me of spring this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 fresh colors like apricot and pink and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 nevertheless nevertheless in the channel on the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.840
 waterline 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730
 what a little bit 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 makes me crazy like that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.970
 Personally very good and laughs when you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.539
 want to know how that works then stays 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.539
 now turn 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.620
 Let's start with a setting base 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 I use mine from urban decay here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
 and give that evenly to mine 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 eyelids 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.219
 he is one side and then of course 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.219
 also the next one 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.930
 when it is slightly dry 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.150
 i use my irvin decay three 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.100
 palette and here i have the color 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.930
 taken trick and distribute the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.120
 even on my mobile 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.460
 eyelid that is a great dimness 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.610
 apricot tone of the perfect in the spring 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.610
 fit 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 By the way, all the colors I use 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.760
 are from the antique three palette 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.490
 Now I use a light dim 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.320
 that is to say the one and the one I use 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.150
 for my inner eye angle and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.150
 bandage that outwards 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.990
 if this step is done use 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.570
 I mean a nice brown tone 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 Now , go into the eyelid fold 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 so that's a bit more 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.320
 structure gets and just at 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.660
 Schlupflidern is always good that again 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.310
 nice to emphasize 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.310
 that opens the eye very much 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.900
 Very important in this step Landon 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.900
 dazzle dazzle 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.360
 Now I go again with the color 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.360
 trick on the lower lash line and land 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.300
 that was it with the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.150
 Eyeshadow, however, is still coming 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.710
 the eyeliner and that counts first and foremost 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 a line and fill it then and 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.340
 very slowly goes up to mine 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.340
 eyes inside 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.940
 now it's called bags bags 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940
 paint in water colors 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.460
 next to my favorite mascara i have 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.020
 me also added a second that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.030
 one of clinique is the exact one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.070
 description I write you 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.900
 of course in the infobox and that is 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.550
 waterproof which of course is great 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.800
 nothing for the lower eyelashes 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.790
 smeared and also gives a whole 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.790
 really great volume 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.180
 we come to the penultimate step the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.530
 Of course you can also optionally 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
 omit, however, I find it very 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.110
 nice, I use a black one 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.110
 kajal for the waterline 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.280
 and last but not least what can not be missing 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.170
 something on the lip and here I use 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.210
 the lipliner I recently dm 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.620
 I bought the exact description 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.960
 I'll pack you in the again 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 Infobox and fill my complete 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.260
 fill lips out nicely and then go 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.630
 I just go with one again 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.630
 lip care about it exactly 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.560
 yes and so easy is dialogue 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.680
 I hope you like it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.470
 I totally remembered spring and is 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.330
 a little something different if you 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.980
