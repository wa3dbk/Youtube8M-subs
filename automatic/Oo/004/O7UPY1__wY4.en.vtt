Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:51.920
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:06.120
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:20.760
I've been there before, that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.400
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.200
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.520
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.760
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, Yeah

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:08.680
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:23.120
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:37.720
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:51.400
With no one to share 
With no one who truly cares for me

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.240
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.640
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.960
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.360
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.800
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.280
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.360
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:54.400
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah
