00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.790 
favorite hey let me look at this analyze
this<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.940> toss-up<00:02:51.420> between<00:02:51.800> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
this I think it's a toss-up between and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920 
this I think it's a toss-up between and
I<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.270> I'm<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.540> sure<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I like this one but I'm not sure I like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.170 
I like this one but I'm not sure I like
the<00:02:55.140> hook<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.770> only<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.190> wish<00:02:56.970> this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the hook that it's only I wish this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.060 
the hook that it's only I wish this
would<00:02:57.360> fold<00:02:57.660> down<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.170> doesn't<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.740> kind<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
would fold down it doesn't so it kind of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.180 
would fold down it doesn't so it kind of
covers<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.460> front<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.620> looks<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.130> of

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
covers the front of it it looks kind of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
covers the front of it it looks kind of
silly<00:03:02.460> like<00:03:02.730> that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
silly like that

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.200 
silly like that
it<00:03:03.750> should<00:03:03.960> fold<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.410> more<00:03:04.440> time<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.880> I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
it should fold one more time I think I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.180 
it should fold one more time I think I
