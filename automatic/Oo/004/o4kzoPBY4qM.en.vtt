 Good morning Oh p p The Lord is the late most not Arthur I feel that I have not been a long time 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.790

 It's because of my motherhood, so what do you do today 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:30.320
 What was the play-by-play's first collaboration videos today 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.080
 It was the first time there was a collaboration video, did it actually? 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.390
 Close to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.850
 I've made it, but who is the one who made that hair plastic 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.400
 Luigi has been hosting a slowly Yuuki-sama, who has been hosting an invitation from us together 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.970
 I decided to play a game 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.100
 Mario Kart or not this time is not Marika 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.460
 What confrontation in the game of confrontation cat tanks 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.519

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.269
 What kind of game is it name 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:06.450
 Well I'm sorry I don't know how to play a tulle 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:09.539
 Still it's not even Te care mug that you can see it is the negative flag 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 Was it not put in the screen and so on 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:18.119
 Oh it doesn't know the screen size because this game was the first look 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 I 've been bashed off by two games in a great collaboration 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.440
 I'm sorry Get Well now let's anyway to concentrate on the play-by-play 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 It is a counterattack that Mr. Unu Nagi who is delicious 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.220
 I got a sense because I was just long-distance shooting this time 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.399
 It is hit at that distance It is tough if you don't let me get out of the way on the first floor . 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.259
 It's hard to come 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.759
 Ok there is still a chance 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.759
 Here, let's cut off at the station 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:57.820
 It is me who always does a good obi yasu 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.500
 I 'm 2.5 times faster because the hitting priest is too bad 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.520
 dare 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.119
 Number of relays 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.119
 What do terrain waiting and I think you have but an array is do not climb 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:17.770
 Where it was countered with here also strengthen bullets that it is continuous bullets as possible cut the physical strength of the snow's in this blow 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.770
 You may set your aim 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.950
 re 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 Mr. Inoki quits from such a zero distance p Lord This is no longer lost I will not give up 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.260
 me 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.030
 Let's cut to the next game 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.939
 I changed the position a little for the screen . 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.569
 Yuki-san has broken into but who by taking software if struck and healed was around the time 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:50.379
 is 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.640
 We're borrowed Suda' cormorant Oh do you say Nja not better to get off the sumo confession vehicles 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.050

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.790
 It's a very unwelcome place and I'm really excited 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.760
 Yes, I understand 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.689
 I came to the end of 31 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.269
 It is a first strike while opening the way with three bullets here 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.269
 Let's increase the probability of winning is also a little pre-emptive strike 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.850
 what's this 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.990
 This is cool 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:27.840
 How do I to say'll Well this may be rather a chance 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:30.080
 If you break down the scaffolding from the position where Mr. Kashiwagi is present, it will just drop and end 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.240
 Nipkaan 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.630
