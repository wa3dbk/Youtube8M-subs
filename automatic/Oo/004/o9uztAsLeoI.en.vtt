00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello everybody, ford launches the new focus 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.860
 2016 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 the model gained a new look 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.510
 more technology equipment and a new 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.340
 price positioning 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.340
 check now never place tv 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.150
 among the visual changes are the new 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 now hexagonal grid thus assigning 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.710
 to focus the new ford dna 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 the lanterns are also new but 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.020
 they are wider in the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 version titanium plus there is a 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 led thread and the xenon headlight it has 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.450
 the adaptive function it adapts to the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.390
 light range for the running condition 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.150
 you're in town is a shorter easy 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.430
 but broader depending on the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.879
 speed on the road he is a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.879
 longer directed light 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.750
 another novelty is the city auto stop that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.820
 through sensors it monitors the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.220
 vehicles that are ahead through the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.830
 plates is not that the reflections of the plates 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.340
 and up to 20 miles per hour it 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.740
 can completely stop the car in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.710
 speeds up to 50 km it 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.080
 can reduce a lot and is a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.310
 impact condition and if the driver does not 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 set the brake 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.810
 focus also wins on titanium version 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.880
 12 the new aid scheme for 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.820
 parking that is able to enter 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.990
 also in perpendicular waves beyond the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.750
 horizontal 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.500
 this system it also takes the car from the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.050
 vacancies 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 the sync entertainment system in the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 version here of the titanium it brings to the canvas 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.880
 8-inch touchscreen with gps 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 and five new apps 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.310
 Taking a walk, I'll tell you guys. 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 the news that this 2016 version brings the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.100
 that Ford has changed here in the finish 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.840
 she used new materials in the cabin 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 has some modifications 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.760
 here in the steering panel is completely 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:29.110
 new command buttons are gone 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 totally redone the region here from the air 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 conditioning also has new buttons 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.340
 everything was modified and the strong 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.209
 of a priority for the acoustics she 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 improved sound insulation 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.069
 applied new internal coatings 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.909
 the visual despite being a change 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.010
 light aesthetics 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.030
 he also benefited from the coefficient 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.549
 aerodynamic, in addition to improving the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.709
 contribute to the reduction of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.610
 consumption also improve the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.920
 issue of cabin wind noise 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.549
 mechanically the cars keep the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.069
 1.6 sigma engines in it in the versions of 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.879
 always with manual gearbox 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.640
 five speeds and 2.0 versions will be 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.349
 sold only with power shift six 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.769
 gears is a dual clutch gearbox 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.220
 a novelty of the 2016 line is hosted 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.220
 chips 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 the engineering target does not hide was 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.689
 offer a better fit than the one 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.930
 goal 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.790
 comparing the two the focus now he has 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.069
 in relation to the differences between 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.319
 focus on golf what i could notice 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.939
 is that the focus is quieter than 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.939
 direction is more direct 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.970
 then we see there that the Ford is a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.239
 sophisticated no focus nÃ© 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.599
 the fight was getting more difficult 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.730
 now it has not yet 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.389
 turbo option 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.400
 So far, you're not in the mix there. 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.940
 in the focus catalog 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.360
 but Ford believes that this range 1.6 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.220
 this engine 2.0 with direct injection 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.330
 the first the direct injection engine 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.360
 flex are enough there to conquer 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.610
 consumers in this segment is a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.250
 difficult segment a segment of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.150
 enthusiastic and are most critical people 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.910
 who value more for the items of 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.360
 technology for the quality of construction 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.210
 of the car and driving dynamics is the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.289
 segment that basically the one 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:02.020
 revealing nor the others and the fight is good 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.970
 very interesting there for those who enjoy

 for those who like a hatch 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.310
 the focus is very interesting 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:20.190
