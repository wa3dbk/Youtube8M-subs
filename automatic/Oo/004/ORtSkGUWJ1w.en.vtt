00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello salt and start the second part 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 interesting mechanisms and today i will teach 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 you how to make a code door 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 m on the door that will open when 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.090
 right pressing the buttons in the right 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.349
 okay the same if we click like this 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 here's a random edge 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 sneakers see nothing happens but 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 if we press the buttons in the right 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.810
 ok and right buttons this door 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 opens like a lobling face cool and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 same work as i was looking for not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
 will be if we press right 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.349
 procedure that is not here so nothing 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.690
 there is no opening reaction though 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.760
 Something is moving there. Well, I think 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 it's time to move on to construction as 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.590
 the mechanism speak simple but rather 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.480
 useful here right to begin show you 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.789
 you tops and made sure that he really 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 simple, just a problem with the scenery 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 thickness let's get started so let's 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 do the same combination lock and also of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 buttons 3 for 3 that is, we will have three 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.510
 buttons like this 3 by 3 and 3 height by 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 we put here buttons any general though 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.420
 stone though there is no difference from how 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.070
 video so now let's set the code 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 who will need to open the door 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 for example 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.159
 here here now yes I will not do full 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.509
 the scenery of this pit off riston only 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 you can do it yourself 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 so let's make a combination of buttons 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.100
 for example such so so so yes that is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.240
 this button will be 1 this button will be 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 2 this button will be the third that you pickle 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 did not intersect it is necessary 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.119
 need to take here and so 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 unscrew the full lozenge if you want 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.130
 make button combinations each on 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.430
 different levels but I have enough of it so much 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.280
 make a diamond like this for now 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 four blocks in general, that's all 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.259
 spend a little growth on just to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.659
 understand something like that since this 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.070
 button 1 ton 1 and should go out like this 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 on that is here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.500
 so this edge 2 so that it should be 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.659
 so here so here we put 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 and this button is 3 so it will 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.820
 go out with us unfortunately in two 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.039
 block because everything is difficult it will 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.570
 go here right here that is the main thing 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.610
 what you need to do here to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.140
 redstone did not intersect exactly 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 tutors that is we are repeaters 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.440
 all the flour and somehow everyone did here 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.920
 fine we have a goal there are many times tones and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.810
 so now what are we going to do now 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.170
 we will almost be moving fast not 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.540
 we put it because we have the first button 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.730
 here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.140
 last here they are then all right 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.800
 all right will be here now 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.900
 excuse me shepard chubby and so all that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.620
 we make the beginning spend a little more 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.410
 whether petrov 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.360
 that's about here on the optional so 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.230
 just put just not so convenient 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.230
 music you disturb me 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.540
 lenser she is so loud enough now 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.500
 from here we enter roadstone 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 here and from here too we have to 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.640
 spend here so here and here so here 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.299
 we will do this 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 roadstone 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.890
 and from here we also spend it that is in 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.410
 the result is that we should have this 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.310
 this is what this growth comes here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.100
 there is not enough to this door 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.900
 that the third button is this means it 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.700
 will open the door but these two 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.860
 buttons will interfere and open the door 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.440
 man do not need so general 27 let's start 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.470
 to the very mechanism 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.100
 nikita here it is now that we should 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.620
 do we remove here spend so 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.650
 here really so fuel just a long time ago 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.200
 the mechanism did this so here we are 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.610
 we put here we put redstone 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.640
 so why put a piston here 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.800
 here so spend here from stone now 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.560
 I'll explain everything for now 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.480
 did not try to understand the soul it is not 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:10.610
 need so okay here we spend set 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.120
 this torch is like this 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.930
 roadstone 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.799
 Everything is fine, in principle, we have the first button 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.799
 what is ready for so a little bit 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.100
 again, calculations were wrong here it was necessary 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.800
 put this torch 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.080
 here and here block so everything fell asleep 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.440
 let us down and all we get is very 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.320
 cool for 1 button we are ready what 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.810
 she makes so do the beginning to 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.110
 better doing everything has been improved 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.760
 so the first button when pressed 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.220
 deactivates this piston by opening 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.340
 pass 2 buttons more precisely pass 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.810
 2 buttons further arrested and the second 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.460
 the button at the time should do the same 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.980
 The most with 3 buttons that is, here you are 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.580
 what happens is this damn show me 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.960
 total flies 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.900
 so we put here the piston is yes here 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:08.600
 And so, too, will do here is remove even 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.240
 so here we put here here the piston and 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.960
 it is better to put it here 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.820
 here so that the ration does not touch here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.640
 now we were making the same design 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.220
 with this with this here bring to you here 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.880
 we also spend 1 tons in general there are many 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.919
 tones times and all those and the second button if u 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.410
 her passage is open he deactivates 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.580
 this piston is here to be done here 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.919
 so then too 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.009
 so everything is fine that is, see what 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.770
 we got 3 button comes here 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.020
 but the piston I do not miss the second button 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.120
 It also comes only to here and 1 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.969
 piston you don't miss but if 1 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.639
 the piston missed that 2 red stone that is 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.740
 if the first button is pressed, it passes 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.780
 here the mechanism activates the second button 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.500
 I want to see it yourself 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.449
 1 concord activates this piston afterwards 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.879
 pressing 2 buttons tests 2 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.250
 piston but actually when you press 3 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.169
 buttons I also open the door the same 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.940
 the most will not work in reverse 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.219
 okay since i already said that one 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.870
 Course it blocks the other but if 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.270
 Of course it is very much to do all this top 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.860
 the door will open but not that big 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.860
 sometimes the problem 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.479
 goal as you can see all the same, even nothing 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:27.210
 works because well and talent is cool 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.770
 that is, the repeaters are set up correctly so 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.599
 what if you open up in the wrong 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.699
 alright just set up a repeater but 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.529
 they are so worth it to me and by the way 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.060
 you can find out the question and if you click 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.830
 on these buttons really everything 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.270
 prepared there are no buttons if 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.810
 Others will not be pressed 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.500
 work 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.120
 that is, purely these buttons so i think 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.830
 this and so everyone knows that just a courtyard 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.930
 do that when you press the button toucans 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.699
 activated okay i'm already starting to carry 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.800
 nonsense and that means it's time to finish 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.319
 in general, thanks to everyone for watching myself 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.629
 if you liked the video you can 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.810
 subscribe to channel like 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:03.740
 okay and what's at the door and a blender by 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.740
 forces okay bye
