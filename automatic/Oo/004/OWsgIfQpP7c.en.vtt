00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.580 

well<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.130> piece<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.520> titled<00:01:13.909> inside<00:01:14.270> out

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.570 

any<00:01:21.190> large<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.820> Stanley<00:01:22.270> he's<00:01:22.540> really<00:01:23.580> pumped

any large for Stanley he's really pumped

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.810 
any large for Stanley he's really pumped
up<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.700> scale

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990 

it's<00:01:30.300> 96<00:01:31.020> inch<00:01:31.230> square

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.590 

that<00:01:43.280> might<00:01:43.490> be<00:01:43.670> because<00:01:44.030> that's<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.480> way

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
that might be because that's the way

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
that might be because that's the way
Stanley<00:01:45.080> paints<00:01:45.440> these

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.230 

I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.420> thinking<00:01:51.869> uh

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.590 

a<00:01:55.270> little<00:01:55.780> more<00:01:56.790> pedda<00:01:57.790> many<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.210> little<00:01:58.450> bit

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
a little more pedda many a little bit

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.510 
a little more pedda many a little bit
more<00:01:58.840> overlaying<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.560> colors<00:01:59.920> maybe<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.340> little

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
more overlaying of colors maybe a little

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.460 
more overlaying of colors maybe a little
more<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.850> fine<00:02:01.119> tuning<00:02:01.600> than<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.930> show<00:02:02.229> that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
more of fine tuning than this show that

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.789 
more of fine tuning than this show that
some<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.610> reason<00:02:03.880> once<00:02:04.060> I've<00:02:04.210> seen

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
some of the reason once I've seen

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.910 
some of the reason once I've seen
and<00:02:05.979> also<00:02:07.709> it's<00:02:08.709> kind<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:10.590> added<00:02:11.590> some<00:02:11.769> extra

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and also it's kind of added some extra

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.690 
and also it's kind of added some extra

unfortunately<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> don't<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.660> any<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:36.020> the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
unfortunately I don't have any of the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.290 
unfortunately I don't have any of the
titles<00:03:36.740> of<00:03:37.040> these<00:03:37.190> pieces

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.100 

but<00:03:41.840> they're<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.020> great<00:03:42.500> kind<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:44.110> beautiful

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
but they're a great kind of beautiful

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.600 
but they're a great kind of beautiful
little<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.560> they<00:03:45.620> look<00:03:45.800> pretty<00:03:46.250> spontaneous

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
little and they look pretty spontaneous

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.600 
little and they look pretty spontaneous
little<00:03:47.300> studies<00:03:48.070> I'd<00:03:49.070> say<00:03:49.400> they're<00:03:49.580> probably

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
little studies I'd say they're probably

00:03:49.610 --> 00:04:14.880 
little studies I'd say they're probably
somewhere<00:03:50.600> around<00:03:50.660> maybe<00:03:51.110> 12<00:03:51.650> by<00:03:51.860> 12<00:03:52.160> 14

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.280 

I<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.610> grape<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.390> green<00:04:16.690> square<00:04:17.110> that

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
I like the grape the green square that

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:38.590 
I like the grape the green square that
extends<00:04:17.890> out<00:04:18.010> into<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.400> horizontal<00:04:19.060> line

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.429 

this<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.290> punchy

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.359 

yeah<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.009> would<00:04:47.309> have<00:04:47.339> to<00:04:47.489> say<00:04:47.819> that<00:04:49.369> Stanley

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:50.369 
yeah I would have to say that Stanley

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:55.910 
yeah I would have to say that Stanley
would<00:04:50.699> probably<00:04:51.089> represent<00:04:51.599> one<00:04:51.779> of<00:04:51.809> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.920 

one<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.190> high<00:04:56.370> points<00:04:56.640> of
