00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.630 

essentially<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> click<00:01:16.590> happens<00:01:17.100> you'll

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
essentially the click happens you'll

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
essentially the click happens you'll
hear<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.900> turn<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.259> key<00:01:19.439> straight

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
hear it you can turn your key straight

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
hear it you can turn your key straight
from<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> workaround<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
from there so that's the workaround you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
from there so that's the workaround you
can<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> regular<00:01:23.820> basis<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
can do this on a regular basis all the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.999 
can do this on a regular basis all the
time<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.009> do

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
time if you have to but you have to do

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
time if you have to but you have to do
is<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.630> connector<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:33.119> turn

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
is like take that connector off to turn

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
is like take that connector off to turn
the<00:01:33.900> key<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> start<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:36.689> did

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the key to start it back up again so did

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
the key to start it back up again so did
a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> searching<00:01:38.390> tried<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a little bit of searching tried to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.289 
a little bit of searching tried to
figure<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> heck<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.880> switch

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
figure out what the heck is the switch

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.719 
figure out what the heck is the switch
that<00:01:42.750> has<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> issue<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> found<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that has the issue so I think I found it

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.749 
that has the issue so I think I found it
so<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.090> pull<00:01:48.299> everything<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:50.549> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so as you pull everything off you have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.660 
so as you pull everything off you have
this<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.570> switch<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> side<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
this one little switch at the side of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.080 
this one little switch at the side of
your<00:01:53.909> ignition<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.340> you'll<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> in

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

turn<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:12.360> switch

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510

stays on for five seconds and then turns

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.050 
stays on for five seconds and then turns
off<00:02:16.840> entirely<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.430> you're<00:02:18.579> not<00:02:18.730> able<00:02:18.909> to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060

do<00:02:19.269> anything<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.840> don't<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.200> your

do anything if you don't have your

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.819 
do anything if you don't have your
father<00:02:20.530> handy<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:24.099> forum<00:02:24.640> say<00:02:25.829> Kawasaki

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
father handy so the forum say Kawasaki

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.569 
father handy so the forum say Kawasaki
replaces<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.140> I'm<00:02:29.140> thinking<00:02:29.769> this<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.549> the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
replaces it and I'm thinking this is the

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.550 
replaces it and I'm thinking this is the
spring<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.209> they<00:02:31.420> say<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.959> they<00:02:32.110> replace

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
spring that they say that they replace

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.910 
spring that they say that they replace
making<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> more<00:02:33.670> robust<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.799> think<00:02:35.799> it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
making it more robust I think it's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.569 
making it more robust I think it's
horseshit<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.799> when<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:38.829> was<00:02:39.040> doing<00:02:39.250> this

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
horseshit because when I was doing this

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.479 
horseshit because when I was doing this
it<00:02:40.390> was<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.260> upright<00:02:41.680> position<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
it was in this upright position that it

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.970 
it was in this upright position that it
was<00:02:42.579> working<00:02:43.060> but<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.019> little<00:02:44.260> solenoid

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
was working but this little solenoid

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.509 
was working but this little solenoid
that's<00:02:45.340> down<00:02:45.579> here<00:02:45.609> that<00:02:46.090> depresses<00:02:46.629> this<00:02:47.519> in

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
that's down here that depresses this in

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.949 
that's down here that depresses this in
order<00:02:48.909> to<00:02:49.120> engage<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
order to engage it

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.910 
order to engage it
that's<00:02:50.650> what<00:02:51.099> wasn't<00:02:51.459> working<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.200> did<00:02:53.709> was

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that's what wasn't working all I did was

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.949 
that's what wasn't working all I did was
blow<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.310> out<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.639> some<00:02:54.819> air<00:02:55.120> compressed<00:02:55.720> air

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
blow it out with some air compressed air

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.180 
blow it out with some air compressed air
and<00:02:56.799> now<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.940> working<00:02:58.120> properly<00:02:58.920> every<00:02:59.920> time

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
and now it's working properly every time

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.729 
and now it's working properly every time
so<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.510> don't<00:03:01.659> know<00:03:01.870> how<00:03:02.049> long<00:03:02.319> it's<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
so I don't know how long it's going to

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.610 
so I don't know how long it's going to
work<00:03:02.950> properly<00:03:03.250> every<00:03:03.790> time<00:03:03.970> for<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.620> my

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
work properly every time for and my

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.970 
work properly every time for and my
question<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.310> what<00:03:06.849> do<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.870> order<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.799> get

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
question is what do I do in order to get

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.030 
question is what do I do in order to get
this<00:03:09.129> cleaned<00:03:09.549> up<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.970> ready<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.299> go<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:11.040> don't

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
this cleaned up and ready to go I don't

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.559 
this cleaned up and ready to go I don't
really<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.670> solution<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:13.389> that<00:03:13.450> yet<00:03:13.870> and

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
really have a solution for that yet and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.960 
really have a solution for that yet and
when<00:03:16.569> option<00:03:16.780> always<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.669> you<00:03:18.669> know<00:03:18.699> I'm

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
when option always is to you know I'm

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.050 
when option always is to you know I'm
never<00:03:19.150> left<00:03:19.480> stranded<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.019> can<00:03:20.230> always<00:03:20.440> you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
never left stranded I can always you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.420 
never left stranded I can always you
unclip<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.090> gray<00:03:22.540> connector<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.889> I'm<00:03:24.220> ready

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
unclip that gray connector and I'm ready

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.710 
unclip that gray connector and I'm ready
to<00:03:24.609> go<00:03:24.819> but<00:03:25.599> this<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.410> issue<00:03:26.620> right<00:03:26.980> now

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
to go but this is the issue right now

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.740 
to go but this is the issue right now
okay<00:03:28.720> after<00:03:29.079> about<00:03:29.470> five<00:03:29.829> tries<00:03:30.280> I'm<00:03:30.699> back<00:03:31.419> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
okay after about five tries I'm back to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.729 
okay after about five tries I'm back to
the<00:03:32.590> issue<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.129> everybody<00:03:33.519> else<00:03:33.699> has

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the issue that everybody else has

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.610 
the issue that everybody else has
depresses<00:03:35.739> doesn't<00:03:36.549> work<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:38.169> the<00:03:38.410> next

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
depresses doesn't work so the next

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.819 
depresses doesn't work so the next
solution<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.150> see<00:03:40.419> everybody<00:03:41.260> talks

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
solution that you see everybody talks

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.909 
solution that you see everybody talks
about<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.430> tapping<00:03:44.310> tap<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:47.500> order<00:03:47.859> to

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
about is tapping tap that in order to

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:58.710 
about is tapping tap that in order to
make<00:03:48.129> that<00:03:48.310> switch<00:03:48.609> work<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:51.669> it<00:03:51.760> goes

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.740 

pretty<00:03:59.720> crappy<00:04:00.170> switch<00:04:00.470> as<00:04:00.739> far<00:04:00.950> as<00:04:01.069> I<00:04:01.190> can<00:04:01.370> see

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
pretty crappy switch as far as I can see

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.720 
pretty crappy switch as far as I can see
so<00:04:02.750> wait<00:04:03.050> for<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.349> to<00:04:03.470> press<00:04:03.860> let's<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.519> if<00:04:04.610> we

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
so wait for it to press let's see if we

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.650 
so wait for it to press let's see if we
can<00:04:04.849> do<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.090> again<00:04:05.180> go<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.050> press<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.530> key<00:04:07.660> it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
can do it again go to press the key it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.039 
can do it again go to press the key it
doesn't<00:04:09.019> work

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:24.250 

click<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.560> goes<00:04:21.400> now<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> solution<00:04:22.810> but<00:04:23.810> it

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
click and it goes now a solution but it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.550 
click and it goes now a solution but it
tells<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.650> where<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.889> problem<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.810> okay<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
tells you where the problem is okay so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.310 
tells you where the problem is okay so
this<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.310> solenoid<00:04:29.090> switch<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:30.050> comes

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
this is the solenoid switch that comes

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
this is the solenoid switch that comes
out<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.770> key<00:04:31.610> pass<00:04:31.880> system<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:33.380> as<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.040> look

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
out of that key pass system so as I look

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.270 
out of that key pass system so as I look
at<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.580> little<00:04:35.000> bit<00:04:35.120> further<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:36.020> little<00:04:36.620> caught

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
at a little bit further a little caught

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.540 
at a little bit further a little caught
up<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.610> at<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.910> end<00:04:38.000> pull<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.510> off<00:04:39.370> pull<00:04:40.370> that

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
up in at the end pull that off pull that

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.840 
up in at the end pull that off pull that
through<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.320> what<00:04:42.560> locks<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.340> key<00:04:43.639> in

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
through this is what locks the key in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.090 
through this is what locks the key in
place<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.080> can't<00:04:45.320> turn<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.830> key

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
place so that you can't turn the key

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.570 
place so that you can't turn the key
when<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:46.850> don't<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.270> your<00:04:47.650> RF<00:04:48.650> fob<00:04:48.979> next<00:04:49.490> to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
when you don't have your RF fob next to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.990 
when you don't have your RF fob next to
you<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:51.260> when<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.590> RF<00:04:52.039> fob<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.490> next<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.880> you

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
you so when the RF fob is next to you

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.140 
you so when the RF fob is next to you
and<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:53.300> push<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.810> button<00:04:54.490> this<00:04:55.490> releases

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
and you push the button this releases

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.890 
and you push the button this releases
you<00:04:56.539> can<00:04:56.720> turn<00:04:56.900> your<00:04:57.080> key<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.210> snaps<00:04:59.570> in

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
you can turn your key and it snaps in

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.080 
you can turn your key and it snaps in
locks<00:05:00.560> your<00:05:00.740> key<00:05:00.950> into<00:05:01.100> place<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.820> can't

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
locks your key into place so you can't

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.290 
locks your key into place so you can't
turn<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:04.070> my<00:05:04.250> thought<00:05:04.520> was<00:05:04.639> get<00:05:05.120> rid<00:05:05.270> of

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
turn it so my thought was get rid of

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.750 
turn it so my thought was get rid of
this<00:05:05.510> altogether

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
this altogether

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.060 
this altogether
who<00:05:07.760> needs<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.210> but<00:05:08.960> then<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.530> can<00:05:09.710> turn<00:05:09.860> it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
who needs it but then you can turn it

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.540 
who needs it but then you can turn it
all<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.190> way<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.760> FS<00:05:11.150> s<00:05:11.450> position<00:05:12.550> then

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
all the way to the FS s position then

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.279 
all the way to the FS s position then
you<00:05:13.760> can<00:05:13.910> take<00:05:14.090> your<00:05:14.270> key<00:05:14.450> out<00:05:14.479> and<00:05:14.720> open<00:05:15.200> up

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
you can take your key out and open up

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.860 
you can take your key out and open up
your<00:05:15.590> saddlebag<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.610> anybody<00:05:17.570> can<00:05:17.750> do<00:05:17.840> it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
your saddlebag and anybody can do it

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.440 
your saddlebag and anybody can do it
walking<00:05:18.349> by<00:05:18.500> now<00:05:19.099> whether<00:05:19.490> or<00:05:19.610> not<00:05:19.700> they<00:05:19.910> do<00:05:20.270> it

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
walking by now whether or not they do it

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.810 
walking by now whether or not they do it
that's<00:05:20.660> another<00:05:20.900> question<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:22.310> as<00:05:22.460> we<00:05:22.610> take

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
that's another question so as we take

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.420 
that's another question so as we take
this<00:05:23.030> apart<00:05:26.169> find<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.470> spring<00:05:28.039> that

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
this apart find the spring that

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.640 
this apart find the spring that
everybody<00:05:28.849> has<00:05:29.030> spoken<00:05:29.419> about<00:05:29.660> before<00:05:29.930> this

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
everybody has spoken about before this

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.310 
everybody has spoken about before this
is<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.010> spring<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.430> they<00:05:31.910> think<00:05:32.320> Kawasaki

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
is the spring that they think Kawasaki

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.870 
is the spring that they think Kawasaki
has<00:05:33.500> replaced<00:05:34.130> with<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:34.789> more<00:05:35.060> robust<00:05:35.510> spring

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
has replaced with a more robust spring

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.379 
has replaced with a more robust spring
again<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.330> say<00:05:38.870> horse<00:05:39.320> shaped<00:05:39.620> or<00:05:40.940> that's

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
again I say horse shaped or that's

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.000 
again I say horse shaped or that's
not<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.900> reason<00:05:42.080> why<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.440> doesn't<00:05:42.830> work

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
not the reason why it doesn't work

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.180 
not the reason why it doesn't work
because<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.729> spring<00:05:44.680> spring<00:05:45.680> isn't<00:05:45.889> the

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
because of the spring spring isn't the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.050 
because of the spring spring isn't the
issue<00:05:46.280> the<00:05:46.729> activation<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:47.599> the<00:05:47.810> issue<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:50.030> I

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
issue the activation is the issue so I

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.390 
issue the activation is the issue so I
cleaned<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.479> all<00:05:50.599> out<00:05:50.840> made<00:05:51.710> sure<00:05:51.979> it<00:05:52.010> was<00:05:52.220> nice

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
cleaned it all out made sure it was nice

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.310 
cleaned it all out made sure it was nice
and<00:05:52.669> clean<00:05:52.940> I'm<00:05:53.690> going<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.870> put<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.169> back

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
and clean I'm going to put it back

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.350 
and clean I'm going to put it back
together<00:05:54.789> test<00:05:55.789> to<00:05:55.910> begin<00:05:57.490> okay<00:05:58.490> so<00:05:59.210> we

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
together test to begin okay so we

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.940 
together test to begin okay so we
cleaned<00:05:59.750> up<00:05:59.930> this<00:06:00.169> solenoid<00:06:01.070> put<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.060> back<00:06:02.210> in

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
cleaned up this solenoid put it back in

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.600 
cleaned up this solenoid put it back in
when<00:06:03.950> to<00:06:04.159> push<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.400> button<00:06:05.950> nada<00:06:06.950> nothing

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
when to push the button nada nothing

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.140 
when to push the button nada nothing
change

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.529 

so<00:06:11.150> that<00:06:11.870> eliminates<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:12.860> switch<00:06:13.850> for

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
so that eliminates the switch for

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.499 
so that eliminates the switch for
depressing<00:06:15.440> locks<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.460> into<00:06:16.580> place<00:06:16.789> we're

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
depressing locks it into place we're

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.499 
depressing locks it into place we're
good<00:06:17.690> there<00:06:18.310> so<00:06:19.310> like<00:06:19.520> everybody<00:06:19.910> talks<00:06:20.330> about

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
good there so like everybody talks about

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:30.120 
good there so like everybody talks about
tap<00:06:21.470> tap<00:06:21.680> tap<00:06:25.630> switch<00:06:26.630> works<00:06:27.340> turn<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.460> key<00:06:28.639> on

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
tap tap tap switch works turn the key on

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.790 
tap tap tap switch works turn the key on
my<00:06:31.130> suspect<00:06:32.090> is<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.660> solenoid<00:06:33.259> is<00:06:33.530> not

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
my suspect is the solenoid is not

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.550 
my suspect is the solenoid is not
working<00:06:34.490> properly<00:06:35.860> that's<00:06:36.860> what<00:06:37.130> I<00:06:37.250> think
