 I nicknamed him, and I hit him again and I came back.

 Martial arts. I do not think so.

 As such, large trucks do not stop for a while after colliding with other vehicles 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 I have to drive.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.680
 You can not take the risk of downstream industries 3 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.720
 Even if it's hard to see , take a good look at this passenger car in front of you. 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.590
 But three of the issues should be seen 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:14.049
 I do not think so. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:19.120
 Ll many will view examples 1 ep 9 But I know this much ramen 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:22.570
 In the case of a large car such as a lower, 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.170
 In the Saga period, the width will be wider. 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:31.360
 Such a high truck itself is advantageous to see far 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.470
 But the sides and the law form the consciousness of Paul in the next room 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.239
 It's not easy to find vehicles in front of a blind spot. 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.079

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.370
 no 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:48.370
 Yes, by weight, by tail, by inertia. 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.019
 BRICK The distance that you can stand is the limit 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.650
 So even if you enter the brakes, you 're just going to take a little longer . 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.010
 This leads to a greater number of accidents and more casualties 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.200
 There are structural parts no choice but to do so you can see 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:09.520
 For example, if a truck runs at a speed of 100 km / h 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:14.500
 An instant loss of culture and the ability to do this, there is also store 180 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.020
 If the supplicant program of 2% if the Omaha Police hanbakseu the foot Gatwick five provinces 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.040

 No assistant professor fits one year can only watch out for the cup 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.410
 I always check through the mirror. Especially when changing lanes, 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.610
 You have to turn around and see if the car is chasing to the left or right. 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.420
 The curvature radius itself is fairly wide when the car is turned off in the curvature salvation 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.870
 Especially since the car is so big, you can see the truck and the bus as well. 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.220
 There is 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.459
 Passenger cars in this side lane often stick together 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.569
 So do not follow Jupiter in salvation. 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.500
 I think it's better to go ahead or follow it 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.209
