what<00:03:22.270> seals<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.860> by<00:03:23.860> applying<00:03:24.130> pressure

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
what seals it by applying pressure

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.170 
what seals it by applying pressure
against<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.510> tank

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180

have to use just fingers to do this and
just<00:03:41.090> hold<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:42.610> you're<00:03:43.610> going<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.760> do<00:03:43.909> a

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
just hold it in you're going to do a

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.699 
just hold it in you're going to do a
little<00:03:44.299> bit<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.480> feeling<00:03:44.810> around<00:03:45.019> take<00:03:45.560> and

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
little bit of feeling around take and

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:58.649 
little bit of feeling around take and
feel<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:47.269> once<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.569> threads<00:03:47.810> grab<00:03:48.079> a<00:03:48.109> hold

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.569 

just<00:03:59.659> like<00:03:59.750> that

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
just like that

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.990 
just like that
now<00:04:01.989> take<00:04:02.989> your<00:04:03.139> wrench<00:04:03.260> or<00:04:03.409> socket<00:04:03.560> again

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
now take your wrench or socket again

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.300 
now take your wrench or socket again
come<00:04:05.000> back<00:04:05.030> down<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.420> side<00:04:07.120> twist<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:09.310> until

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
come back down the side twist it until

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.629 
come back down the side twist it until
it<00:04:10.430> feels<00:04:10.609> tight<00:04:12.220> then<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.310> want<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.519> turn

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
it feels tight then you want to turn

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.870 
it feels tight then you want to turn
around

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
around

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.009 

wrench<00:04:16.880> isn't<00:04:17.180> always<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.539> best<00:04:17.570> thing<00:04:17.810> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
wrench isn't always the best thing to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.960 
wrench isn't always the best thing to
grab<00:04:18.199> usually<00:04:18.709> it's<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.889> socket<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.370> grab

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
grab usually it's a socket that you grab

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.029 
grab usually it's a socket that you grab
but<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.660> guard<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.349> ratchet<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.739> time<00:04:21.919> to

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
but I guard the ratchet this time to

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.370 
but I guard the ratchet this time to
show<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.400> could<00:04:22.550> be<00:04:22.669> done<00:04:24.010> tighten<00:04:25.010> it

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
show that it could be done tighten it

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.120 
show that it could be done tighten it
you're<00:04:27.380> going<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.560> feel<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> bit<00:04:27.919> it's<00:04:28.070> really

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
you're going to feel a bit it's really

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.189 
you're going to feel a bit it's really
snug<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:29.300> because<00:04:29.570> there's<00:04:29.720> rubber<00:04:29.960> there

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
snug and because there's rubber there

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.920 
snug and because there's rubber there
you<00:04:30.770> don't<00:04:30.860> have<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.160> squish<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.520> too<00:04:31.669> hard

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
you don't have to squish it too hard

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.900 
you don't have to squish it too hard
there<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.050> go<00:04:33.199> just<00:04:33.470> like<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:35.949> now<00:04:36.949> because

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
there we go just like that now because

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.279 
there we go just like that now because
