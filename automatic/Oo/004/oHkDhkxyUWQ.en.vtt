 I 've interviewed you 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.460

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:32.740

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 create a weather all along a world 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:43.630

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:52.270
 next to you the atomic bomb is really 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:57.570
 only say fed and appropriate 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.570
 find where I'm in the best hands 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:09.060
 where it would be as a youth sins 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 everything now gone 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.990
 75 times here in the water make my 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:28.560
 I have language rosenfeld here as 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.310

 together laura brÃ¶mmel and i still have 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.010
 rocketry 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.200
 I have coordinates with where to go 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:02.320
 then send online first time 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.680
 send to the friend grenades what me 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.680
 everything else 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.430
 Nobody is there, people are actually 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:18.150
 really cool make your own team fun first 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:30.830
 Once upon a time , change that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 plus is naldo want at first very much 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:51.170
 lick probably now only has to 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.170
 knowing invite you closer 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.380
 usually it is more that now 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.900
 a good place looks 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.880
 and ended up with success 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.360
 Forms everything around me at the bank 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.940
 huge action radius 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.860
 then we must be the last student 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.020
 The water does not come behind the small one 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.239
 pretty much wrong 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 what do the layers mean ? 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:29.750
 the music is a little quieter with me 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:37.160
 can understand a bit better now 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:44.020

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.020
 Sections block nato power holds 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:41.840
 exactly in the middle times I look where I 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:46.630
 middle goes in about under the line 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:51.860

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:03.910
 It will look like that again 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:24.610
 this probably more like a wall well 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:34.279
 such a look now also some things 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:37.490
 which offer the bios at least some 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:46.300
 Cool worlds too and still very cool 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:46.300
 now it's up to you but what else 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:07:00.999

00:06:51.889 --> 00:07:00.999
 Rhine train stadium 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:17.529

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.249
 survive mode are still strengthened 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:42.580
