side-by-side<00:01:17.630> comparison<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.920> g13<00:01:19.670> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
side-by-side comparison of the g13 and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.929 
side-by-side comparison of the g13 and
my<00:01:20.330> Razer<00:01:20.630> Nostromo<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:22.369> know<00:01:22.490> when<00:01:22.820> you're

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
my Razer Nostromo you know when you're

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.190 
my Razer Nostromo you know when you're
looking<00:01:23.060> at<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:23.479> oh<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.750> not<00:01:23.840> too<00:01:24.020> big

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
looking at it's like oh it's not too big

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.109 
looking at it's like oh it's not too big
but<00:01:24.560> looking<00:01:25.039> at<00:01:25.130> here<00:01:25.429> there<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.969> a

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
but looking at here there is a

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.450 
but looking at here there is a
significant<00:01:26.929> size<00:01:27.229> difference<00:01:27.799> that's<00:01:28.280> right

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
significant size difference that's right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.459 
significant size difference that's right
just<00:01:28.670> look<00:01:28.789> at<00:01:28.909> those<00:01:29.030> numbers<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.719> mean<00:01:29.840> this<00:01:30.200> G

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
just look at those numbers I mean this G

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.489 
just look at those numbers I mean this G
13<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.219> almost<00:01:31.759> double<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.210> size<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
13 is almost double the size of the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.510 
13 is almost double the size of the
Nostromo<00:01:34.009> but<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:35.030> do<00:01:35.149> get<00:01:35.359> a<00:01:35.390> lot<00:01:35.689> more<00:01:35.749> keys

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
Nostromo but you do get a lot more keys

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.910 
Nostromo but you do get a lot more keys
you<00:01:37.520> know<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.119> size<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.810> there's<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:39.679> I

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
you know for the size so there's that I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.099 
you know for the size so there's that I
think<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:41.179> kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.420> tell<00:01:41.600> from<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.899> top

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
think you can kind of tell from the top

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.200 
think you can kind of tell from the top
down<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:43.579> know<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> way<00:01:43.909> you're

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
down that you know the way you're

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.389 
down that you know the way you're
holding<00:01:44.479> game<00:01:45.289> pads<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.679> little<00:01:45.920> bit<00:01:46.009> different

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
holding game pads a little bit different

would think that a lot of gamers could
relate<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:09.920> that's<00:03:10.070> why<00:03:10.220> we're

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
relate to that so that's why we're

relate to that so that's why we're
trying<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.670> show<00:03:10.910> here<00:03:11.390> right<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.550> here<00:03:13.550> we

anyway<00:05:37.729> you<00:05:38.060> can<00:05:38.630> see<00:05:38.780> on<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.050> LCD<00:05:39.590> display<00:05:39.710> on

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
anyway you can see on the LCD display on

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.850 
anyway you can see on the LCD display on
the<00:05:40.280> g13<00:05:40.910> that<00:05:41.270> it<00:05:41.360> shows<00:05:41.570> your<00:05:41.810> stats<00:05:42.229> in<00:05:42.530> real

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
the g13 that it shows your stats in real

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.920 
the g13 that it shows your stats in real
time<00:05:43.130> mind<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.669> while<00:05:44.449> you're<00:05:44.660> playing<00:05:44.810> the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
time mind you while you're playing the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.710 
time mind you while you're playing the
game<00:05:45.139> so<00:05:45.349> I<00:05:46.250> thought<00:05:46.760> that<00:05:46.970> this<00:05:47.150> was<00:05:47.330> really

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
game so I thought that this was really

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.750 
game so I thought that this was really
really<00:05:48.020> handy<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:49.220> because<00:05:49.550> sometimes

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
really handy just because sometimes

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.490 
really handy just because sometimes
there's<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.300> lot<00:05:50.449> going<00:05:50.690> on<00:05:50.810> on<00:05:50.990> your<00:05:51.110> screen

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
there's a lot going on on your screen

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.290 
there's a lot going on on your screen

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
but it's easy to look down especially

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.670 
but it's easy to look down especially
