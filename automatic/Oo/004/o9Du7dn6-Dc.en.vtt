00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
little bit of confidence or if your

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
little bit of confidence or if your
challengers<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.309> usually<00:00:56.730> intimidated

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
challengers are usually intimidated

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420

because<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.079> realize<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.920> they're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because what they realize is they're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
because what they realize is they're
stepping<00:00:59.789> into<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> ring<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.199> man<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
stepping into the ring with the man that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
stepping into the ring with the man that
wears<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.010> belt<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> obviously<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.390> best

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
wears this belt is obviously the best

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
is they get that little bit of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
is they get that little bit of
nervousness<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> queasiness
