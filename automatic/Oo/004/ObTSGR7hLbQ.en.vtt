fun I guess that is the key feature of
the<00:03:02.690> voice<00:03:02.810> as<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.170> say<00:03:03.379> it's<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.980> fact<00:03:04.190> that

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
the voice as you say it's the fact that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.580 
the voice as you say it's the fact that
the<00:03:04.549> image<00:03:04.910> isn't<00:03:05.750> important<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:06.530> not

leading it yeah it's more it's a their
blind<00:03:09.470> auditions<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.160> beginning<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.610> I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
blind auditions in the beginning so I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.069 
blind auditions in the beginning so I
think<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.030> there's<00:03:11.239> that's<00:03:11.720> why<00:03:11.870> it's

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
think that there's that's why it's

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.600 
think that there's that's why it's
caught<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.319> like<00:03:12.560> fire<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.190> States<00:03:13.489> like

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
caught on like fire in the States like

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.729 
caught on like fire in the States like
people<00:03:13.849> love<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.930> can't<00:03:15.200> tell<00:03:15.500> like

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
people love that but you can't tell like

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.990 
people love that but you can't tell like
what's<00:03:15.980> going<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.340> behind<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.790> just

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
what's going on behind you you just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.490 
what's going on behind you you just
really<00:03:17.389> are<00:03:17.480> listening<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.930> voice<00:03:18.049> but<00:03:18.380> do

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
really are listening to the voice but do

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.259 
really are listening to the voice but do
you<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:19.160> there<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.790> know<00:03:19.970> there's

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
you think that there is you know there's

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.319 
you think that there is you know there's
so<00:03:20.569> much<00:03:20.810> pressure<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:22.040> those<00:03:22.370> who<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.940> sing

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
so much pressure on those who can sing

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.840 
so much pressure on those who can sing
brilliantly<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.440> maybe<00:03:24.739> don't<00:03:25.190> fit<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.819> mold

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
brilliantly but maybe don't fit the mold

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.940 
brilliantly but maybe don't fit the mold
oh<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.630> think<00:03:26.900> that's<00:03:27.170> been<00:03:27.440> going<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.709> for

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
oh I think that's been going on for

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.920 
oh I think that's been going on for
years<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:29.060> know<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.209> mean<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.569> think<00:03:29.630> that's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
years you know I mean I think that's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.690 
years you know I mean I think that's
nothing<00:03:30.319> new<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.709> that's<00:03:30.859> very<00:03:31.489> much<00:03:31.639> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
nothing new and that's very much the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.539 
nothing new and that's very much the
industry<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:33.530> think<00:03:33.739> that's<00:03:34.130> why<00:03:34.310> it's

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
industry and I think that's why it's

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.949 
industry and I think that's why it's
kind<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.849> breath<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.150> fresh<00:03:35.209> air<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.780> with

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
kind of a breath of fresh air like with

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.599 
kind of a breath of fresh air like with
the<00:03:36.079> voice<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.380> think<00:03:36.440> people<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:37.340> just

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
the voice I think people it's just

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.220 
the voice I think people it's just

lot of things that you do not have
control<00:04:36.080> over<00:04:36.409> and<00:04:36.889> as<00:04:37.069> any<00:04:37.310> 20<00:04:37.729> year<00:04:37.849> old<00:04:37.999> like

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180
