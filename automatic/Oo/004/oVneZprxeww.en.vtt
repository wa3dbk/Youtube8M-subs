some of my videos

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.280 
some of my videos
the<00:02:50.530> theory<00:02:51.430> sounds<00:02:52.090> sort<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.540> quite<00:02:52.810> simple

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the theory sounds sort of quite simple

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.819 
the theory sounds sort of quite simple
but<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.590> practicality<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:55.530> recording<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> is

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
but the practicality of recording it is

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.399 
but the practicality of recording it is
quite<00:02:57.069> difficult<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.939> I'm<00:02:58.480> hoping<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.049> bring<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
quite difficult so I'm hoping to bring a
