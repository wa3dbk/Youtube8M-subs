00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.039 
really uh because I think that styles
make<00:01:56.950> fights<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.579> my<00:01:57.729> opinion<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.359> be<00:01:58.840> some

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
make fights and in my opinion to be some

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
make fights and in my opinion to be some
hakuna<00:01:59.469> style<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:01.299> lead<00:02:01.509> him<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:01.749> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
hakuna style will lead him to a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.380 
hakuna style will lead him to a
unanimous<00:02:03.280> decision<00:02:03.549> when<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.149> won't<00:02:04.299> be

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
unanimous decision when I won't be

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.139 
unanimous decision when I won't be
surprised<00:02:04.689> events<00:02:05.109> are<00:02:05.229> being<00:02:05.350> closed<00:02:05.679> but<00:02:06.399> be

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
surprised events are being closed but be

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.550 
surprised events are being closed but be
so<00:02:07.210> make<00:02:07.420> sure<00:02:07.450> you're<00:02:07.719> using<00:02:07.749> his<00:02:08.140> legs<00:02:08.410> in
