00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.860
 Hello my name is Artem and you 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.900
 see internet tales shows where 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.850
 check various posts for strength 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.140
 how often have you been on the internet 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.140
 in the picture of a similar plan 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.380
 Yes, I also often and I thought so 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.369
 why the hell why not try in 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.080
 in this release I will make an egg without a shell 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:34.010
 for this we need the bank kryzhechka 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:38.179
 vinegar and the eggs themselves everything is ready you can 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.710
 I will not begin to destroy all the eggs 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.710
 so take just a couple 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 fill the jar with vinegar 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:08.799
 and first went 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.799
 now the second one went 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 what happens is not given 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 nothing you hurt something you wanted eggs in 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 vinegar look just fucking bubbles 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.460
 Now we will cover the jar with a lid so that 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.460
 the room did not stink of vinegar 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.500
 and put it in the fridge for a couple of days here 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.330
 need to make a small digression when 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 I covered the jar with a lid 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.410
 took into account the possibility of an explosion no seriously on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.820
 next day cover so much 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.910
 pouted that I decided that I needed 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.160
 give a little air a bomb 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.900
 so my ears are laid and the next one 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.320
 about ten minutes I went just like that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.540
 depressed for such was frightened 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:18.750
 so take care of yourself in this know and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.970
 here they are unfortunately from the explosion of 1 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.970
 burst open the bank 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.550
 stench by the way worth disgusting because 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.550
 vinegar that i spend my life 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:50.140
 and I got the surviving zu 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.140
 slippery smelly well i love everything 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.680
 that's actually washed from all sorts of times 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:25.640
 marks it looks very good 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 rubles transparent yolk inside floats 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.320
 Well, since the egg is most likely impossible 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.910
 there is 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.910
 build a small crash test 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:11.080
 and it's time to look at the true world 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.280
 the bike turned out to be true but I didn't 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.070
 I advise you to repeat from home 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.900
 the stench was creepy on if the bank 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.150
