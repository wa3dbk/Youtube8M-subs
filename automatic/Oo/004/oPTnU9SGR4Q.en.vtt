usually<00:00:20.189> comes<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.970> motion<00:00:21.570> track

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
usually comes with your motion track

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.300 
usually comes with your motion track
template<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.320> you're<00:00:22.470> lucky<00:00:22.619> sometimes<00:00:23.160> they

template if you're lucky sometimes they

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.450 
template if you're lucky sometimes they
include<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> motion<00:00:24.449> sequence<00:00:25.460> image

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
include the motion sequence image

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
include the motion sequence image
sequence<00:00:26.789> sorry<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.529> if<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.189> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
sequence sorry but if not you know it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.569 
sequence sorry but if not you know it's
really<00:00:30.720> easy<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.260> take<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:32.399> things

really easy just take this first things

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
really easy just take this first things
first<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.940> take<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:34.200> into

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
first you take this and you go into

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
first you take this and you go into
Saudi<00:00:35.070> Vegas<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> render<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> as

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
Saudi Vegas and you want to render it as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.200 
Saudi Vegas and you want to render it as
an<00:00:36.809> image<00:00:36.960> sequence<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
an image sequence so to do so you just

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.440 
an image sequence so to do so you just
go<00:00:39.360> file<00:00:39.710> read<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.860> eyes<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:42.239> click

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
go file read your eyes and you click

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
go file read your eyes and you click
image<00:00:42.930> sequence<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> T<00:00:43.920> iff<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
image sequence and T iff and make a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
image sequence and T iff and make a
folder<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.370> makes<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
folder because as you can see it makes a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.439 
folder because as you can see it makes a
lot<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> images<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
lot of images so you just like say it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.590 
lot of images so you just like say it
there<00:00:51.660> render<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.149> then<00:00:54.149> once<00:00:54.449> that's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there render it and then once that's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.770 
there render it and then once that's
done<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:56.070> into<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:59.359> cinema<00:01:00.359> 4d<00:01:00.570> file

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
done you can go into your cinema 4d file

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
done you can go into your cinema 4d file
so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.050> open<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:04.400> hopefully<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.460> will<00:01:05.519> take

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so you open it up hopefully it will take

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
so you open it up hopefully it will take
too<00:01:05.850> long<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.240> thought<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.080> opened<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.439> up

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
too long I thought I had opened it up

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.110 
too long I thought I had opened it up
but<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:07.860> guess<00:01:08.100> not

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.030 

okay<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.290> as<00:01:15.160> you<00:01:15.520> can<00:01:15.610> see<00:01:15.850> i<00:01:17.040> accidentally

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
okay so as you can see i accidentally

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.670 
okay so as you can see i accidentally
saved<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.640> i<00:01:19.410> normally<00:01:20.410> you'd<00:01:20.500> have<00:01:20.530> a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
saved it so i normally you'd have a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.340 
saved it so i normally you'd have a
background<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.630> image<00:01:22.630> for<00:01:22.990> background

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
background and a image for background

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.960 
background and a image for background
and<00:01:23.470> floor<00:01:23.710> right<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.610> first<00:01:24.850> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and floor right so you have to first of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.430 
and floor right so you have to first of
all<00:01:25.030> delete<00:01:25.360> those<00:01:25.540> two<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.020> should<00:01:26.320> be

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
all delete those two that should be

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.320 
all delete those two that should be
right<00:01:26.620> here<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.870> want<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.170> go<00:01:29.380> and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
right here and then you want to go and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.580 
right here and then you want to go and
double<00:01:31.330> click<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.600> texture<00:01:32.050> thing<00:01:32.230> which

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
double click on the texture thing which

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.680 
double click on the texture thing which
will<00:01:32.740> make<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.920> new<00:01:33.100> material<00:01:33.420> double<00:01:34.420> click<00:01:34.510> on

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
will make a new material double click on

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.240 
will make a new material double click on
the<00:01:34.750> material<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:35.440> go<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.890> part<00:01:36.070> where<00:01:36.100> it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the material and go to the part where it

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.100 
the material and go to the part where it
says<00:01:36.280> texture<00:01:36.850> click<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.570> that<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.900> want

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
says texture click on that and you want

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.180 
says texture click on that and you want
to<00:01:41.350> go<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:42.570> wherever<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.900> saved<00:01:44.440> your

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
to go to wherever you saved your

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.670 
to go to wherever you saved your
sequence<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.000> pick<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.330> first<00:01:46.540> one<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.590> you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
sequence and pick the first one so you

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.790 
sequence and pick the first one so you
rank<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.010> open<00:01:48.490> click<00:01:48.970> no<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.540> then<00:01:50.500> after

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
rank it open click no and then after

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.050 
rank it open click no and then after
that<00:01:50.890> you're<00:01:51.010> gonna<00:01:51.130> have<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.490> go<00:01:51.580> back<00:01:51.760> into

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
that you're gonna have to go back into

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.890 
that you're gonna have to go back into
it<00:01:52.270> go<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.660> animation<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.530> calculate<00:01:54.900> so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
it go to animation and calculate so

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.770 
it go to animation and calculate so
that's<00:01:56.110> fine<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.740> close<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.510> dragon<00:01:58.510> onto

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
that's fine just close that dragon onto

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.630 
that's fine just close that dragon onto
your<00:01:58.900> background<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.530> drag<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:00.340> onto<00:02:00.490> your

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
your background and drag it onto your

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.150 
your background and drag it onto your
floor<00:02:01.080> as<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.320> see<00:02:02.530> if<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.830> can<00:02:02.980> render

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
floor as you can see if you can render

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.800 
floor as you can see if you can render
