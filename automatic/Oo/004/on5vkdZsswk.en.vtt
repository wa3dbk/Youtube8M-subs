00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.799
 here we are but always ready to look 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.640
 this cell phone 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.640
 there ok 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.809
 yet another bad day 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.970
 ugly game but I mean go in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 advantage of two goals singh and even two 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 beautiful goals because the goal of hernanes but 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.130
 especially that of the palace does not have 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.609
 really two goals to the game in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.149
 total control and then decide to do 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.840
 harakiri as it happened exactly like 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.660
 rightly as against the atanta 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 when he makes two glaring mistakes 1 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 with campagnaro that opens the field e 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 the bonaventura door and one of guarin o 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 by day you now have to understand who 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 exactly what they do mark 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.239
 bonaventura to the ninetieth 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 obviously left alone during 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 half of a free kick then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 okay 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.129
 same thing happened yesterday same thing 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.719
 happened yesterday two quiet zero yes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.829
 beats a corner kick less than Livorno 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 takes a corner kick 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.470
 all there is a ricky paolino 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.939
 left there alone that can enter 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.479
 quietly cut the field on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.460
 first pole arrive on the ball 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 undisturbed without anyone around or a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 right or left, neither front nor back 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.759
 very good then paolini to evolve 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.330
 however it was not easy though if maybe 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.880
 someone probably had the market 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.590
 the door would not have taken 2 to 1 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 still playing in hand because 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.900
 you're always in front of Livorno doesn't 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 much then rightly I have it here 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.759
 with mazzarri quite rightly there is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.439
 from controlling a game we know that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.610
 we are not able to control the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.490
 games 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.869
 who comes out that I don't want to take 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.970
 one with guarin but I say so from 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.460
 months that nick and guarin 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.549
 he's not a player right now 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.770
 for months precisely he is shifting 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.780
 the balance is better for others 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 and it is not a fury because it is not 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.180
 I say since yesterday after the error but I say from 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.680
 a lot of an anarchist player a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 player who plays by himself than not 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 it affects nothing about the team that plays 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.700
 only with his head down he thinks he is 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.870
 PelÃ¨ and it's not good and looks for numbers 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.209
 unlikely that they never succeed 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.120
 and I don't know what you think comes into play 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.540
 that is, an account is to encourage a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.549
 player who puts his soul and who is there 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.989
 try trying to improve search for 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.970
 better 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.470
 together with the team an account is a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.120
 player who thinks he can play from 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.940
 only in series with and perhaps inside 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.190
 Guarino did not understand where he is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.049
 so I don't understand why mazzarri has 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 decided on 2 to 1 for us we must 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.620
 administer to let an anarchist enter 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.519
 as guarin who is in this moment 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.739
 doing only damage 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.569
 so surely between in guerin report card 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.879
 because it is something like that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.940
 done he is something really that not 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.060
 I've been seeing these for years for years 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.000
 levels but I don't see them even if I go to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.590
 see my friends promotion people not 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.810
 mark when five years of no 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.530
 give the ball back when not 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.690
 he can see so far from the door 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.180
 let it be, they don't read you in oil and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.950
 then mazzarri cannot let guarin enter 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.140
 on 2 to 1 that is you need someone 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.540
 that is, you administer but then why 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.030
 kovacic never plays 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.090
 but because it does not seem to me what is there 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.060
 so scazzi that scarce indeed us then 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.139
 kovacs the if inferior to guarin oa 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.750
 kuzmanovic but signor mazzarri I have you 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.430
 always defended and I will defend you again but 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.889
 if doing things that the fans 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.669
 of the own do not understand that 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.019
 today imbufalito with you mister 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.459
 let us therefore leave it alone 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.500
 we know for which I am not imbufalito 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.180
 with you but how do you put a down 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.069
 midfield like that after all that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.579
 which happened until now as you do on the 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.579
 2 to 1 to let guarin guarin 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.660
 but I'm not talking about the next non-matches 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.720
 they talk about the rigors because I don't want to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.740
 repeating myself here is really to understand 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.180
 what to do next year I have an idea 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.450
 I will not say the next time his 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.430
 sforato however I greet you 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.440
 appointment to the next game now 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.180
 quarter champion or europe zone 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.770
 very difficult place even though it was 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.200
 crosses three points but it really is 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.700
 very difficult considering the trend 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.070
 having said that I must close the outburst 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.100
 even if it will go on for hours hours hours in the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.510
 my invective I can't have to close 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.490
 we hope to be more cheerful there 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.490
 next time hello to tuut
